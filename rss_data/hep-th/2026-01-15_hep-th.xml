      <title>The geometry of CP violation in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the free, massless Dirac equation $D\psi = 0$ on a higher-dimensional manifold $M_4 \times K$ equipped with a submersion metric. These background metrics generalize the Kaluza ansatz. They encode 4D massive gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars, alongside the usual 4D metric and massless gauge fields. We show that the dimensional reduction of the Dirac equation on these backgrounds naturally violates CP symmetry in four dimensions. This provides a new geometric path to constructing models with intrinsic CP violation. In this framework, massive gauge fields can break CP for three different reasons: $i)$ a misalignment between the mass eigenspinors and the spinors in the representation basis; $ii)$ a new non-minimal term coupling 4D fermions to massive gauge fields; $iii)$ the presence of a non-abelian Pauli term. All this derives from the higher-dimensional Dirac equation. Technically, the paper uses the language of spin geometry and Riemannian submersions. Along the way, it develops detailed geometric descriptions of several constructions. It discusses gauge anomalies, fermion generations, and introduces a new Lie derivative of spinors along non-Killing vector fields induced by actions of compact groups.</description>

      <title>On Cosmological Singularities in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of a $3+1$ dimensional spacetime, where space is a large three-sphere, due to small perturbations of the background fields. We focus on two classes of deformations. One corresponds on the worldsheet to time-dependent non-abelian Thirring deformations. The other to perturbations of the radius of the three-sphere. In the former case, we find that small deformations generically lead to big-bang and big-crunch singularities, near which the spacetime becomes highly anisotropic. We argue that string theory likely resolves these singularities. In the latter case, general solutions have the property that the radius of the three-sphere goes to infinity at a finite time, but there are no solutions in which it collapses to zero. We also discuss the interplay of these spacetime properties with the corresponding worldsheet RG flows.</description>

      <title>A melonic quantum mechanical model without disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quantum mechanical model involving interacting fermions without disorder that has the same low energy physics as the supersymmetric SYK model. The model is $SU(2)$ invariant, and the supercharge involves the $ SU(2) $ 3j symbol. We analyze various solvable corners, conceptually explain why it has a melonic expansion, and perform an exact diagonalization for small values of $N$. Expanded around the states with maximal angular momentum, the model is approximated by a two dimensional CFT. The BPS states have a simple description in that regime.</description>

      <title>The CFT Distance Conjecture and Tensionless String Limits in $\mathcal N=2$ Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of infinite-distance limits on (complex) multi-dimensional conformal manifolds of 4d SCFTs and their bulk interpretation as tensionless-string limits in AdS/CFT. In particular, we focus on 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU$ quiver gauge theories with hypermultiplets in the bifundamental and fundamental representations. In the overall-free limit, we compute the large-$N$ Hagedorn temperature $T_H$, which governs the stringy exponential growth of the density of states at high energies. We argue that this quantity determines the type of stringy ultraviolet completion in the bulk: it captures the type of string theory in which the bulk physics is embedded while remaining insensitive to detailed geometric data. For linear quivers, we find that $T_H$ depends only on the quiver length, which is tied to the number of NS5-branes in the underlying brane construction and, in turn, to the string theory in which the bulk is embedded. For holographic quivers, where we impose that the two central charges $a$ and $c$ coincide in the large-$N$ limit, we show that $T_H$ coincides with that of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, which befits the 10d Type IIB description of their gravitational duals. We also analyze the exponential rate $\alpha$, which controls how the leading tower of higher-spin currents becomes conserved in these limits, as suggested by the CFT Distance Conjecture. In the large-$N$ regime, we derive sharp bounds on the minimal rate, $1/\sqrt{2}\le \alpha_{\min}\le \sqrt{2/3}$, attained in the overall-free limit. Moreover, we prove that the universal lower bound $\alpha\ge 1/\sqrt{2}$ holds, including at finite $N$. Finally, we go beyond the overall-free ray by characterizing the convex hull of the $\vec{\alpha}$-vectors that encode the exponential rate of the higher-spin towers along any (partial) weak-coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Cutting Rules from Flat-Space Unitarity via Dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using cosmological dressing rules, we uplift flat-space unitarity cuts to discontinuity relations for dS/EAdS observables. In this representation, Cutkosky delta functions map directly to "Disc" operations in the exchanged energy variable. This provides a transparent diagram by diagram origin of cosmological cutting rules. We illustrate this with explicit examples at tree level and one loop for conformally coupled scalars.</description>

      <title>On string loops in Calabi-Yau orientifolds in large volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain and illustrate how to compute string-loop amplitudes in Calabi-Yau orientifold compactification in the large volume limit with the help of the patch-by-patch description of string field theory. We compute the one-loop partition function of the D1-instanton in type IIB string theory compactified on an O9 orientifold of a Calabi-Yau threefold to the first order in the large volume expansion. We show that the unphysical divergence arising from a naive choice of PCOs is canceled by vertical integration. The corollaries of this result, including the universal part of the normalization of the D-instanton superpotential and the one-loop renormalization of K\"ahler moduli, will be presented elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Web of dualities on non-orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a two-dimensional bosonic theory with a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry can be fermionized. Recent work shows that if the bosonic theory also has non-anomalous time-reversal symmetry, fermionization extends to non-orientable surfaces and yields a fermionic theory that depends on a $\mathrm{Pin}^-$ structure. Besides fermionization, one can define various topological manipulations, such as gauging and stacking invertible phases, which together generate a web of dualities. We prove that their group structure is the dihedral group $D_8$ of order 16. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the web from two perspectives: Symmetry TFT and actions on sectors of the $S^1$ Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations in Two-Species Born--Infeld Theories Governing Vortices and Antivortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09091v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive several new Bogomol'nyi (self-dual) equations in two-species $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories governed by the Born--Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.
  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Free Stable Minkowski Vacua in Lovelock Compactifications on Irreducible Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the compactification of higher-dimensional Lovelock gravity on compact irreducible symmetric spaces, focusing on conditions under which a physically healthy four-dimensional Minkowski vacuum exists. We show that when the internal dimension is five or less, or when the theory is restricted to the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet sector, the four-dimensional graviton (tensor sector) is necessarily a ghost. Inclusion of the cubic Lovelock term removes this ghost instability; however, the resulting Minkowski vacuum is generically only metastable, being accompanied by energetically favored Anti-de Sitter vacua. While such metastability cannot be avoided for spherical internal spaces, we identify an infinite class of higher-rank symmetric spaces where the true vacuum can be pushed to infinity in moduli space, thereby realizing genuinely stable and ghost-free Minkowski vacua at the level of the four-dimensional effective theory. To support these conclusions, we explicitly compute Lovelock terms up to cubic order on these spaces, confirming a universal log-convexity among the linear, quadratic, and cubic invariants, which plays a central role in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Process During Complex Time Evolution In Two-Dimensional Integrable and Chaotic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complex time evolution of a vacuum state with the insertion of a local primary operator in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs). This complex time evolution can be considered as a composite process constructed from Lorentzian time evolution and a Euclidean evolution induced by a post-selected measurement. Our main finding is that in the spatially-compact system, this complex time evolution drives the state of the subsystems to those of the primary state with the same conformal dimensions of the inserted operator. Contrary to the compact system, the subsystems of the spatially non-compact system evolve to states that depend on the non-unitary process during a certain time regime. In holographic systems with a compact spatial direction, this process induced by a heavy local operator can correspond to the relaxation from a black hole with an inhomogeneous horizon to that with a uniform one, while in the ones with a non-compact spatial direction, it can correspond to the relaxation to that with a horizon depending on the non-unitary process.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, One Point Functions and Black Hole Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible Nielsen circuits and 3d Ising gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Nielsen's formulation of quantum circuit complexity to include intrinsically non-invertible operations. Such gates arise from fusion with topological defect operators and remove a basic limitation of symmetry-based circuits: the inability to change superselection sectors, or in two-dimensional CFTs, conformal families. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels acting between sectors, with consistency ensured by the fusion and associator data of an underlying unitary modular tensor category. In contrast to standard Nielsen circuits, non-invertible circuits lead to an optimisation problem that is no longer governed by geodesics on a continuous group manifold but instead reduces to a discrete shortest-path problem on the fusion graph of superselection sectors. We illustrate the framework in representative rational conformal field theories. Finally, we interpret fusion-induced transitions as discrete changes in boundary stress-tensor data, corresponding to shock-like defects in AdS$_3$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible circuit complexity from fusion operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern understanding of symmetry in quantum field theory includes both invertible and non-invertible operations. Motivated by this, we extend Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity to incorporate non-invertible gates. These arise naturally from fusion of topological defects and allow transitions between superselection sectors. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels. Including such gates makes the sector-changing optimisation problem discrete: it reduces to a weighted shortest-path problem on the fusion graph. Circuit complexity therefore combines continuous geometry within sectors with discrete sector jumps. We illustrate the framework in rational conformal field theories and briefly comment on an AdS$_3$ interpretation in which fusion-induced transitions correspond to geometry-changing boundary operations. A companion paper provides full derivations and extended examples.</description>

      <title>Spatial Wilson Loops and Energy Loss for Heavy Quarks in Magnetized HQCD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective potential and the string tension for the spatial Wilson loop (SWL) in hot dense QGP with two types of anisotropy, i.e. external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy, employing a holographic approach for the heavy quark model. In this approach, the string is extended in the 5th, holographic direction and has a turning point either on a dynamical wall (DW) configuration or on the horizon configuration in the 5th direction. We obtain the magnetic catalysis behavior for a phase transition between DW and horizon configuration of the string. The structure of the phase diagram does not depend on the boundary conditions choice for the dilaton field. Inclusion of the external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy enhance the string tension in the horizon configuration, namely drag force. For the spatially isotropic case $\nu = 1$ at different magnetic field values the string tension is proportional to $T^2$ and is qualitatively consistent with lattice results. However, for the anisotropic case, $\nu = 4.5$, it deviates from the quadratic term.</description>

      <title>Diamonds in the Bulk and Large-$N$ Scaling in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius.</description>

Motivated by this puzzle, we revisit the problem of classifying saddle-point geometries for the one-loop amplitude. We find an infinite family of complex saddles that dominate the high-energy regime. Using general constraints and matching to numerical data, we formulate a bootstrap problem that determines their multiplicities. This procedure yields a precise asymptotic expansion of the one-loop amplitude at high energies. The resulting oscillatory contributions lead to a much richer high-energy behavior than that predicted by the original Gross-Mende analysis.</description>

      <title>BRST Symmetry Violation and Fundamental Limitations of Asymptotic Safety in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic safety program assumes that quantum gravity becomes renormalizable through ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based couplings. We demonstrate that this approach {encounters fundamental symmetry violations} across multiple independent criteria, all traceable to a single fundamental cause: the breakdown of general covariance and BRST symmetries above the gravitational cutoff scale. Rigorous canonical quantization proves that general covariance cannot be maintained quantum mechanically in dimensions greater than two, while recent path integral calculations reveal persistent gauge parameter dependence in quantum gravitational corrections, signaling BRST symmetry violation. These dual proofs establish that the metric tensor ceases to exist as a valid quantum degree of freedom above $\Lambda_{\text{grav}}$$\sim$$10^{18}$ GeV, rendering the search for ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based theories {problematic from a foundational physical perspective}. We provide comprehensive analysis demonstrating that asymptotic safety exhibits persistent gauge parameter dependence where fixed-point properties vary with arbitrary gauge choices, non-convergent truncation schemes extending to the 35th order showing no approach to stable values, experimental {tensions} with electroweak precision tests by orders of magnitude, matter content requirements incompatible with the Standard Model, absence of concrete graviton predictions due to gauge and truncation dependence, unitarity {challenges} through ghost instabilities and propagator negativity, and fundamental Wick rotation obstructions preventing reliable connection between Euclidean calculations and physical Lorentzian spacetime. We contrast this with the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity framework that systematically avoids all asymptotic safety pathologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the consequences of a recent paper on quantum gravity are 1) a duality between point particles and massive scalar propagators, 2) the recovery of the entropy of a boundary (a black hole) in the same form as that of the EFT approach to Quantum Gravity and 3) a quantum correction to Hawking radiations and a Page-like curve. In this recent paper, information about what lies inside a boundary is encoded onto it, meaning that in this approach the information directly leaks from the horizon to the bulk in the form of Hawking radiations.</description>

      <title>Dirac Sources for Nonmetricity and Torsion in Metric-affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric-affine gravity (GL(4) gauge theory) in 4-dimensions is coupled to a spacetime Dirac source field using the isomorphisms of the Lie algebra gl(4) to the Clifford algebras Cl(3,1) and Cl(2,2). A simple transformation relates the generators of Cl(3,1) to a real representation of Cl(2,2), while the real representation of Cl(2,2) serves directly as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(4). Therefore, although GL(4) does not contain a spinor representation of the Lorentz group, expanding its Lie algebra in the Cl(2,2) basis gives a Clifford valued connection with well-defined coupling to Dirac spinors. Variation of the expansion coefficients gives new Dirac sources for both torsion and nonmetricity, separated by identifying the so(3,1) basis within the gl(4) basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity. For an extended Higgs-like scalar self-interaction, we find that the resulting field equations belong to the damped Ermakov-Painlev\'e II class and construct novel analytical solutions within the framework of the Chiellini integrability condition. We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \gtrsim 70 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Sub-Leading Logarithms for Scalar Potential Models on de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continual production of long wavelength scalars and gravitons during inflation injects secular growth into loop corrections which would be constant in flat space. One typically finds that each additional factor of the loop counting parameter can induce up to a certain number of logarithms of the scale factor. Loop corrections that attain this number are known as ``leading logarithms''; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models. We show that the first sub-leading logarithm is captured by applying the stochastic formalism to a certain part of the 1-loop effective potential. This is checked at 2-loops for a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on de Sitter background.</description>

Abstract: In this work we show that results of Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory can be easily obtained using the recently proposed supersymmetric expansion algorithm. Our formalism avoids the sums over intermediate states and yield directly corrections to the energy and eigenstates in terms of integrals weighted by the probability densities for the edge states of the involved supersymmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to discuss the modular flavor model and the stabilization of single modulus field in the Jordan frame supergravity with non-minimal scalar-curvature coupling of the form $\Phi(\tau,\bar{\tau})R$. Modular invariance and positivity of the scale factor constrain stringently the form of the frame function, consequently the Kahler potential by the relation $\Phi(\tau,\bar{\tau})=-3\exp[-K(\tau,\bar{\tau})/3]$. We discuss some general properties of scalar potentials after the scale transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. We find that the shape of the resulting scalar potential in the Einstein frame is quite different from that of ordinary single modulus stabilization mechanism. The scalar potential could be stationary at the $i\infty$ fixed point, leading to a runaway type vacuum. We also discuss numerically the modulus stabilization for some simplified scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs at a lepton collider with polarised beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>Confronting eikonal and post-Kerr methods with numerical evolution of scalar field perturbations in spacetimes beyond Kerr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate computation of quasinormal modes from rotating black holes beyond general relativity is crucial for testing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation.</description>

      <title>Line Operators in $U(1|1)$ Chern-Simons Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the non-semisimple category of line operators in Chern-Simons gauge theories based off the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$. Our proposal is that the category of line operators $\mathcal{C}$ can be identified with the derived category of modules for a boundary vertex operator algebra $\mathcal{V}$ realized as a certain infinite-order simple current extension of the affine current algebra $V(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ by boundary monopole operators. By translating this simple current extension of $V(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ to the unrolled, restricted quantum group $\overline{U}^E(\fgl(1|1))$, we show that our category of line operators admits a second description in terms of a quasi-quantum group $\mathcal{A}$ realized by uprolling. We also compare our results across an expected physical duality with the cyclic orbifold of a free, $B$-twisted hypermultiplet and find a slight discrepancy at the level of braiding and associator. We end with a detailed analysis of coupling to background flat $GL(1, \C)$ connections and the resulting category of non-genuine line operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

We analyze the non-perturbative constraints on these correlators, which include a topological sector, pinching and splitting limits, and we compute a variety of bulk-defect-defect correlators up to next-to-leading order at weak coupling, surprisingly observing that transcendental terms cancel. Additionally, we provide results in the strong-coupling regime for the first two leading orders using a mixture of Witten diagrams and non-perturbative constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries by extended dynamical defects entails the existence of defect families, which form conformal manifolds in a critical setup. In the presence of bulk 't Hooft anomalies, defects are in fact required to break the symmetry: defect conformal manifolds are anomaly-enforced. We show that, by coupling the system to a modulated deformation parameter, the geometric structure of the conformal manifold is sensitive to the 't Hooft anomaly. This leads to measurable effects in the presence of a boundary/defect: in (1+1)d the anomaly predicts a quantized boundary charge pumping, while in higher dimensions it gives rise to non-dissipative boundary Hall currents.</description>

Abstract: Correlators of large-scale fluctuations produced during cosmic inflation are major observables of inflationary cosmology. In cosmological collider physics, many interesting correlators are generated through loop processes. However, ultraviolet divergences often appear when computing the loop correlators, and a regularization is required. In this work, K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation and dimensional regularization are used to analytically compute various correlators with a bubble loop of massive bulk propagators in de Sitter spacetime. Examples include 4-point and 2-point correlators with 1-loop bubble exchanges of derivatively coupled massive scalars or massive spin-1 bosons.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we attempt to construct bit thread configurations for various backgrounds using expressions from the covariant phase space formalism. We find that when the Ryu-Takayanagi surface is same as the horizon, such expressions are sufficient. In other cases, it differs by gradient of a harmonic function. We explore its relation to Wald and differential entropy, and re-express the first law of entanglement entropy in terms of bit threads. Inclusion of quantum effects imposes some constraints on the bulk entanglement via the dominant energy condition. We also apply our method to ascertain a bit thread configuration in a certain dynamical spacetime.</description>

While this large mutual information is not generally sufficient to imply scattering, arxiv:2404.15400 showed that for a certain class of geometries, bulk scattering is implied by a certain relation between two (possibly non-minimal) Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. Here, we show that the 2-to-2 version of the theorem becomes an equivalence in pure AdS$_3$: large mutual information between appropriate boundary subregions is both necessary and sufficient for bulk scattering. This result allows us to extend the findings of arxiv:2404.15400 to a broader class of asymptotically AdS$_3$ spacetimes, which we illustrate with the spinning conical defect geometry. In contrast, we find that matter sources can disrupt this converse relation, and that the $n$-to-$n$ version of the theorem with $n&gt;2$ lacks a converse even in the AdS$_3$ vacuum.</description>

      <title>To gauge or to double gauge? Matrix models, global symmetry, and black hole cohomologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of the Hilbert space of gauged matrix models with a global symmetry. In the first part of the paper, we focus on bosonic matrix models with $U(2)$ gauge group and $SO(d)$ global symmetry, and consider singlets under both the gauge and global symmetry. We show how such "double-gauged'' matrix models can be described in terms of a simpler $SO(3)$ single-matrix model. In the second part of the paper, we consider the so-called BMN subsector of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory, which is closely related to the BMN matrix model. Among the 1/16 BPS operators in this sector, "non-graviton'' operators were recently discovered, which are expected to relate to the microstates of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black holes. We show that a double gauging of this model, where one projects onto $SU(3)_R$ $R$-symmetry singlets, considerably simplifies the analysis of the non-graviton spectrum. In particular, for low values of $N$, we show that (almost) all graviton operators project out of the spectrum, while important classes of non-graviton operators remain. In the $N=3$ case, we obtain a closed form expression for the superconformal index of singlet non-gravitons, which reveals structural features of their spectrum.</description>

      <title>Counting AdS Vacua</title>

Abstract: We study the 'number' $\mathfrak{N}(\mu)$ of AdS vacua with a UV cut off $ \mu$. It has been proposed that this number is finite. We find evidence that $\mathfrak{N}(\mu)\sim a \ \mu^{-b}$ as $\mu \rightarrow 0$ for some constants $a$ and $b$ of $O(1)$ in Planck units that may depend on dimension and the number of supercharges. For this result to hold it is crucial to integrate over the volume of massless and tachyonic directions of AdS which corresponds to the volume of the space of marginal and relevant deformations of the dual CFT. We are led to the surprising prediction that theories with large number of light moduli contribute very little to the volume measure among all theories. We also speculate about the dS case leading to the number of quasi-dS vacua of the order of $\Lambda^{-\alpha}$ for some $O(1)$ parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Backgrounds and Background Independence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with an algebraic extension of the causal wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Negativity and Thermodynamics in Backreacted AdS Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate holographic entanglement negativity (HEN) as a probe of mixed state quantum correlations in a deformed AdS black hole background with backreaction sourced by a string cloud. The bulk geometry is dual to a strongly coupled large-$N_c$ gauge theory at finite temperature, backreacted by a finite density of heavy static fundamental quarks. We analyze entanglement thermodynamics and establish a first law like relation in the small backreaction regime by identifying the deformed black hole at zero temperature as the natural ground state of the dual field theory. Using analytic expansions in the low and high temperature limits, we compute the HEN for adjacent, bipartite and disjoint subsystem configurations and examine its dependence on the backreaction parameter $\rho$. Our results reveal that at low temperature and high effective temperature, backreaction increases the HEN signaling enhancement of distillable quantum correlations. We further compare the behavior of HEN with holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and mutual information (MI), demonstrating that entanglement negativity provides a sharper diagnostic of the competition between thermal and quantum correlations in holographic plasmas with matter backreaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prototype of a Euclidean wormhole solution of Einstein gravity coupled to matter is the axion wormhole in four spacetime dimensions. In this primarily expository article, we spell out some details about this construction. The axion wormhole has a semiclassical description, found in the original paper [1], in which the matter system is a two-form gauge field B with three-form field strength H=dB. The two-form is dual to a massless scalar, but the wormhole does not have a semiclassical description in terms of the scalar. There is no contradiction here as the duality between the two-form and the scalar is not a simple transformation of classical fields but involves, in Euclidean signature, a Poisson resummation of the sum over fluxes. Because of the need for this Poisson resummation, the scalar field cannot be treated semiclassically in the wormhole throat. Nonetheless, it is straightforward to compute the effective action derived from the wormhole in the scalar (or two-form) language, recovering standard claims.</description>

Abstract: There is a method for constructing from first principles, a holographic bulk dual action in Euclidean $AdS_{d+1}$ space for a $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the boundary, starting from the Polchinski's Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) equation that describes the RG evolution of the interaction part of the boundary Wilson action. The bulk action in $AdS_{d+1}$ has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry and is obtained from the evolution operator of the Polchinski's ERG equation by a map that involves a field redefinition and requires a $\textit{special}$ form of the UV cutoff function in the ERG equation. In this paper, we show that for $\textit{any form}$ of the cutoff function, the ERG evolution operator has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry. The generators of the special conformal transformation depend on the cutoff function. For the special cutoff function that maps to $AdS$ space, the transformations have the standard form of $AdS$ isometry. We also show that the ERG evolution operator for the $\textit{full}$ Wilson action can be put in the same form as the Polchinski's ERG equation by a field redefinition and consequently also has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry for any cutoff function.</description>

      <title>Causality Criteria for Island Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Island models offer a compelling resolution of the black hole information paradox, but they also raise persistent questions about causal consistency in effective descriptions. In particular, effective theories arising in double holography can exhibit apparent violations of micro-causality, despite the underlying bulk dynamics being local and causal. The aim of this work is to clarify the physical origin of this phenomenon and to identify the structural features that control causal consistency in island models.
  We argue that the apparent non-causality in double holography is neither intrinsic to island physics nor a consequence of nonlocal operator reconstruction. Rather, it reflects a mismatch between effective spacetime separation and bulk causal accessibility, a feature already implicit in earlier analyses. Nonlocal reconstruction instead encodes quantum error correction within a restricted code subspace and does not introduce independent propagation channels.
  Motivated by this perspective, we formulate a structural criterion for micro-causality in effective island descriptions. The criterion consists of three conditions: the absence of independent propagation channels beyond those of the bulk theory, a local bulk-supported operator dictionary, and a consistent matching between effective spacelike separation and dynamically accessible bulk causal curves. When these conditions are satisfied, effective micro-causality follows directly from bulk micro-causality. We apply the criterion to brane world realizations of island models, including the defect-extremal-surface construction, and show that they preserve causal consistency, in contrast to double holography. We further demonstrate that the criterion remains robust in time-dependent processes such as island formation and evaporation.</description>

      <title>Boundary flow and geometric realization in holographic $T\bar T$-deformed BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $T\bar T$ deformation of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) from an intrinsic field-theoretic perspective. Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics.
  On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically. Using entanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature, we disentangle universal consequences of the intrinsic boundary-localized flow from features that depend on the holographic implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1408.4429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and prove an extension of Connes's reconstruction theorem for commutative spectral triples to so-called Connes-Landi or isospectral deformations of commutative spectral triples along the action of a compact Abelian Lie group $G$, also known as toric noncommutative manifolds. In particular, we propose an abstract definition for such spectral triples, where noncommutativity is entirely governed by a deformation parameter sitting in the second group cohomology of the Pontrjagin dual of $G$, and then show that such spectral triples are well-behaved under further Connes-Landi deformation, thereby allowing for both quantisation from and dequantisation to $G$-equivariant abstract commutative spectral triples. We then use a refinement of the Connes-Dubois-Violette splitting homomorphism to conclude that suitable Connes-Landi deformations of commutative spectral triples by a rational deformation parameter are almost-commutative in the general, topologically non-trivial sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system of ${\rm BC}_n$ type with five arbitrary constants and propose $R$-matrix valued generalization for $2n\times 2n$ Takasaki's Lax pair. For this purpose we extend the Kirillov's ${\rm B}$-type associative Yang-Baxter equations to the similar relations depending on the spectral parameters and the Planck constants. General construction uses the elliptic Shibukawa-Ueno $R$-operator and the Komori-Hikami $K$-operators satisfying reflection equation. Then, using the Felder-Pasquier construction the answer for the Lax pair is also written in terms of the Baxter's 8-vertex $R$-matrix. As a by-product of the constructed Lax pair we also propose ${\rm BC}_n$ type generalization for the elliptic XYZ long-range spin chain, and we present arguments pointing to its integrability.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, accounting for a number of systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform a full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum sharpens constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10\%$ and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $H_0=68.8\pm 0.6$ km/s/Mpc, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Similar results are obtained in a joint analysis with DR1 BAO, accounting for the cross-covariance. Finally, the bispectrum data improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Topological Defect Formation Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Crossover Transitions with Approximate Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous second-order phase transitions is well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate, such transitions become smooth crossovers, and the applicability of KZM in these scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing both a weakly coupled Ginzburg-Landau model and a strongly coupled holographic setup, each featuring pseudo-spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. In the slow quench regime, we observe a breakdown of the universal power-law scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. Specifically, the defect density acquires an exponential correction dependent on the quench rate, following a universal form dictated by the source of explicit symmetry breaking. Although these dynamics extend beyond the scope of the traditional KZM, we demonstrate that a generalized framework, that incorporates the effects of explicit symmetry breaking into the dynamical correlation length, remains valid and accurately captures the non-equilibrium defect formation across the entire range of quench rates.</description>

      <title>Validity of relativistic hydrodynamics beyond local equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the applicability of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium by constructing formal solutions of the Boltzmann moment equations in the relaxation time approximation. These solutions naturally decompose into a divergent gradient series and exponentially decaying non-perturbative modes that encode initial conditions. The non-perturbative contributions are essential for understanding causality, the divergence of the gradient series, and the unexpected effectiveness of relativistic hydrodynamics far from equilibrium.
  In the 0+1D Bjorken scenario, we demonstrate that the exact evolution of non-equilibrium terms shares the same structural form as the gradient expansion, differing only through modified transport coefficients that reflect both initial data and free-streaming dynamics. Extending to 3+1D, we find that hydrodynamics remains effective not because the system is close to equilibrium, but because it interpolates smoothly between free streaming and collective behavior. This perspective offers a natural explanation for the remarkable success of hydrodynamics in modeling quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Black Holes, far from Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6</description>

      <title>Classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model: relation to Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat and 1-site classical XYZ model with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a description of the classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 8 independent coupling constants through a pair of ${\rm BC}_1$ type classical Sklyanin algebras generated by the (classical) quadratic reflection equation with non-dynamical XYZ $r$-matrix. For this purpose, we consider the classical version of the $L$-operator for the Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model proposed by O. Chalykh. In ${\rm BC}_1$ case it is factorized to the product of two Lax matrices depending on 4 constants. Then we apply an IRF-Vertex type gauge transformation and obtain a product of the Lax matrices for the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostats. Each of them is described by the ${\rm BC}_1$ version of the classical Sklyanin algebra. In particular case, when 4 pairs of constants coincide, the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model exactly coincides with the relativistic Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat. Explicit change of variables is obtained. We also consider another special case of the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 7 independent constants. We show that it can be reproduced by considering the transfer matrix of the classical 1-site XYZ chain with boundaries. In the end of the paper, using another gauge transformation we represent the Chalykh's Lax matrix in a form depending on the Sklyanin's generators.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Behavior of the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation in Horava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.</description>
