      <title>Nonlinear skin modes and fixed-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. Nonlinearities are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as power-energy dependence, degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.</description>

      <title>Convectons in unbalanced natural doubly diffusive convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluids subject to both thermal and compositional variations can undergo doubly diffusive convection when these properties both affect the fluid density and diffuse at different rates. In natural doubly diffusive convection, the gradients of temperature and salinity are aligned with each other and orthogonal to gravity. The resulting buoyancy-driven flows are known to lead to the formation of a variety of patterns, including spatially localized states of convection surrounded by quiescent fluid, which are known as convectons. Localized pattern formation in natural doubly diffusive convection has been studied under a specific balance where the effects of temperature and salinity changes are opposite but of equal intensity on the fluid density. In this case, a steady conduction state exists and convectons bifurcate from it. The aforementioned buoyancy balance underpins our knowledge of this pattern formation but it is an ideal case that can hardly be met experimentally or in nature. This article addresses how localized pattern formation in natural doubly diffusive convection is affected by departures from the balanced case. In particular, the absence of a conduction state leads to the unfolding of the bifurcations to convectons. In thermally dominated regimes, the background flow promotes localized states with convection rolls attached to the end-walls, known as anticonvectons, and the existence of these states is found to be related to the emergence of convectons. The results presented here shed light on the convecton robustness against changes in the buoyancy ratio and extend the scope of our understanding of localized pattern formation in fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic parameterization of positive streamer heads in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of streamer discharges is determined at their heads, for individual streamers as well as in collective phenomena, such as streamer trees or coronas or streamer bursts ahead of lighting leaders. Some properties of the streamer heads, such as velocity $v$ and radius $R$ now can be measured quite well, but this is very challenging for others such as the maximal electric field, the charge content of the streamer head and the degree of chemical excitation and ionization in the streamer channel. Here we develop, test and evaluate a macroscopic approximation for positive streamer heads in air that relates macroscopic streamer head properties to each other. In particular, we find that velocity $v$, radius $R$ and background field $E_{\rm bg}$ determine the complete profile of streamer heads with photoionization, if they propagate steadily. We also review Naidis' approximate relation between $v$, $R$ and the maximal field $E_{\rm max}$. The approximate head model developed in the present paper consists of three first-order ordinary differential equations along the streamer axis. It is derived from the classical fluid model for streamer discharges by assuming axisymmetry, steady streamer propagation (i.e. with constant velocity and shape), and a spherical shape of the charge layer around the streamer head. The new reduced model agrees well with full solutions of the classical fluid model, even when it is applied to accelerating streamers. Therefore the model can be used for evaluations of experiments, like for the determination of the maximal electric field from radius and velocity of the streamer, and it is a step towards constructing reduced models for the collective dynamics of multi-streamer discharges.</description>
