      <title>Generalized mixed variable-pullback scheme with non-ideal Ohm's law for electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the non-ideal Ohm's law is integrated in the mixed variable-pullback scheme for the gyrokinetic particle simulations. This scheme captures the evolution of the symplectic solution of the gyrokinetic model accurately not only in the MHD limit but also in the electrostatic limit. This scheme also provides a pure symplectic ($v_\shortparallel $) scheme for electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle simulations without causing the traditional cancellation problem in the pure Hamiltonian scheme. Various mixed variable schemes have been comprehensively analyzed for the 1D shear Alfv\`en wave problem with kinetic electrons, with the connection to the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme and the symplectic scheme. It is demonstrated that the pure $v_\shortparallel $ form with the non-ideal Ohm's law has comparable performance to the widely used mixed variable-pullback scheme with the ideal Ohm's law. The mixed variable-pullback scheme without Ohm's law is also proposed as a feasible improvement of the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme with minimum modification and considerable performance improvement in terms of a marker number reduction.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic momentum distributions due to radiation recoil in relativistic plasmas with electric and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of strong electromagnetic fields with plasma generates radiation accompanied by a recoil force, which can significantly alter the plasma dynamics. In this work, we investigate the development of anisotropic momentum distributions induced by the combined action of electric and magnetic fields on a thermally relativistic plasma. We consider three distinct types of anisotropy. The first arises from a pure magnetic field acting on plasma with either isotropic or anisotropic initial momentum distributions, producing the characteristic ring-shaped momentum profile. The second is driven by a pure electric field, where radiation reaction generates a partial, anisotropic ring distribution in momentum space: significant modifications occur primarily in the 90$^\circ$--180$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$--360$^\circ$ sectors of the $p_x$--$p_y$ plane, while the remaining quadrants remain largely unaffected. The third case considers the combined effect of electric and magnetic fields. When the cyclotron frequency is very close to the upper hybrid frequency, the azimuthal symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution is broken. Conversely, in the regime where the cyclotron frequency is lower than the upper hybrid frequency, the rapid oscillations of the electric field dominate and preserve the symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-amplitude slow-mode waves are commonly observed near Earth's magnetopause. Recent observations show that these waves can occur simultaneously with kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves. The amplitude of the ion acoustic waves is enhanced near the magnetic field peaks of the slow-mode wave, suggesting that the slow-mode waves may drive the generation of ion acoustic waves. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a hybrid simulation using observation-based parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that large-amplitude slow-mode waves generate counter-streaming ion beams, which in turn excite ion acoustic waves and relax the ion beams. Our study reveals a clear energy transfer channel from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Thermal resilience of the ITER tungsten first wall to runaway electron impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast volumetric deposition of multi-MeV high current runaway electron (RE) beams constitutes the most critical issue for the ITER tungsten (W) first wall (FW) longevity. Such relativistic electron beams could generate extreme volumetric power densities inside the FW armour which lead to significant vaporization, deep melting and even material explosions, as well as to elevated temperatures at the bond interface with the cooling substrate that could cause rupture and water leaks. Here the thermal response of the ITER FW is modeled with a three-stage, one-way coupled workflow focusing on assessments of the extent of the wall damage and the increase of the bond interface temperature for varying W thickness. Increased W thickness is found to be essential for wall protection against intense RE dissipation events in terms of both W tile damage and cooling system integrity.</description>

      <title>Nature of Transonic Sub-Alfv\'enic Turbulence and Density Fluctuations in the Near-Sun Solar Wind: Insights from Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations and Nearly-Incompressible Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Parker Solar Probe measurements have revealed that solar wind (SW) turbulence transits from a subsonic to a transonic regime near the Sun, while remaining sub-Alfv\'enic. These observations call for a revision of existing SW models, where turbulence is considered to be both subsonic and sub-Alfv\'enic. In this Letter, we introduce a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of Transonic sub-Alfv\'enic Turbulence (TsAT). Our model shows that turbulence is effectively nearly-incompressible (NI) and has a 2D + slab geometry not only in the subsonic limit, but also in the transonic regime, as long as it remains sub-Alfv\'enic, a condition essentially enforced everywhere in the heliosphere by the strong local magnetic field. These predictions are consistent with 3D MHD simulations, showing that transonic turbulence is dominated by low frequency quasi-2D incompressible structures, while compressible fluctuations are a minor component corresponding to low frequency slow modes and high frequency fast modes. Our new TsAT model extends existing NI theories of turbulence, and is potentially relevant for the theoretical and numerical modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Sun SW, the solar corona, and the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>The periodicity of three-dimensional oscillatory reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory reconnection is a dynamic, magnetic relaxation mechanism in which a perturbed null point reverts back to equilibrium via time-dependent reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the long-term periodic signal generated by a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point, when it is perturbed by a non-periodic driver, for a variety of driving amplitudes. We solve the 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a bespoke numerical boundary condition (a sponge region) that damps wave reflections and thus allows the long-term periodic signal at the 3D null point to be investigated. We observe multiple cycles of the 3D oscillatory reconnection mechanism for the first time. We find that the periodicity is both constant and independent of the choice of driving amplitude. Furthermore, the resultant time-dependent current density at the null point normalized by the driving amplitude is invariant. We extract a single period for oscillatory reconnection at a 3D null point, opening the future possibility of using this characteristic period as a diagnostic tool to reveal indirectly the fundamental plasma properties of 3D null points.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Neural Space Weather Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.</description>

      <title>Toward a Theory of Gravitational Wave Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes. Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv\'enic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv\'enic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Residual energy of magnetohydrodynamic shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual energy quantifies the difference in energy between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in a plasma. Recent observational evidence highlights that fast-mode interplanetary shock waves have positive residual energy, in sharp contrast to the negative residual energy of the turbulence and magnetic structures that constitute the vast majority of fluctuation power in the solar wind at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) inertial scales. In this work, we apply the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to derive an equation for the residual energy of an MHD shock jump as a function of the shock angle, density compression ratio and Alfv\'en Mach number upstream of the shock. An equation for the cross helicity is similarly derived. The residual energy equation gives only positive values for super-Alfv\'enic (i.e. fast-mode) shocks. The residual energy and cross helicity of slow-mode shocks and tangential, contact and rotational discontinuities are also determined. A simplified form of the residual energy equation applicable to perpendicular shocks has been verified against residual energy values directly estimated from observations of 141 interplanetary shocks; the equation is found to match well with observations, particularly for shocks with higher density compression ratios and Mach numbers. The use of positive residual energy as a signature for fast-mode shock identification in spacecraft data is briefly considered, and insights from this work relating to compressive fluctuations more generally in the solar wind are discussed.</description>

      <title>Characterization of NBI-driven shear Alfv\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator using Mirnov probes and electrostatic potential fluctuation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first experimental measurements of the toroidal mode number of shear Alfv\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator. A series of experiments were carried out in three different magnetic configurations to investigate counter-NBI driven modes. Co- and counter- electron-cyclotron current drive was used to modify the rotational transform (\iotabar) profile leading to the destabilization of a varied set of Alfv\'en eigenmodes with different frequencies and mode numbers. To characterize the spatial structure of the modes we have used two Mirnov probe arrays, one dedicated to the measurement of the poloidal mode number and the other, a recently commissioned helical tri-axial array, dedicated to the measurement of the toroidal mode number. A heavy ion beam probe, operated in radial sweep mode, was employed to characterize the radial location of the modes. We show that the induced changes in \iotabar, that are fundamental when it comes to validation studies, cannot be measured experimentally with motional Stark effect so, instead, the shielding current diffusion equation is solved in cylindrical geometry to estimate these changes. We calculate the incompressible shear Alfv\'en continuum for selected cases using \texttt{STELLGAP} and find reasonable consistency with observations. A database with the observed modes has been created, so that it can be used in future work for theory validation purposes.</description>

      <title>Feedforward equilibrium trajectory optimization with GSPulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the common tasks required for designing new plasma scenarios or evaluating capabilities of a tokamak is to design the desired equilibria using a Grad-Shafranov (GS) equilibrium solver. However, most standard equilibrium solvers are time-independent and do not include dynamic effects such as plasma current flux consumption, induced vessel currents, or voltage constraints. Another class of tools, plasma equilibrium evolution simulators, do include time-dependent effects. These are generally structured to solve the forward problem of evolving the plasma equilibrium given feedback-controlled voltages. In this work, we introduce GSPulse, a novel algorithm for equilibrium trajectory optimization, that is more akin to a pulse planner than a pulse simulator. GSPulse includes time-dependent effects and solves the inverse problem: given a user-specified set of target equilibrium shapes, as well as limits on the coil currents and voltages, the optimizer returns trajectories of the voltages, currents, and achievable equilibria. This task is useful for scoping performance of a tokamak and exploring the space of achievable pulses. The computed equilibria satisfy both Grad-Shafranov force balance and axisymmetric circuit dynamics. The optimization is performed by restructuring the free-boundary equilibrium evolution (FBEE) equations into a form where it is computationally efficient to optimize the entire dynamic sequence. GSPulse can solve for hundreds of equilibria simultaneously within a few minutes. GSPulse has been validated against NSTX-U and MAST-U experiments and against SPARC feedback control simulations, and is being used to perform scenario design for SPARC. The computed trajectories can be used as feedforward inputs to inform and improve feedback performance. The code for GSPulse is available open-source at https://github.com/jwai-cfs/GSPulse_public.</description>

      <title>Conceptual design of a Doppler Backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $&lt;$ $\rho$ $&lt;$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$&lt;$ $k_{\perp}$ $&lt;$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\sim35^{\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).</description>
