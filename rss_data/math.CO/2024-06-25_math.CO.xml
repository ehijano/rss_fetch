      <title>On mutually $\mu$-intersecting quasi-Hermitian varieties with some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15589v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutually intersecting varieties of a finite Desarguesian projective space are varieties with the same size, such that the intersection of two of them contains the same number of points. Here, we show the existence of a new family of mutually intersecting varieties by using certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(n,q^2)$, where $q$ is any prime power. With the help of these quasi-Hermitian varieties we provide a new construction of $5$-dimensional MDS codes over ${\mathbb F}_q$ as well as an infinite family of simple orthogonal arrays $OA(q^{2n-1},q^{2n-2},q,2)$ of index $\mu=q^{2n-3}$.</description>

      <title>Duplicated Steiner triple systems with self-orthogonal near resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Steiner triple system, STS$(v)$, is a family of $3$-subsets (blocks) of a set of $v$ elements such that any two elements occur together in precisely one block. A collection of triples consisting of two copies of each block of an STS is called a duplicated Steiner triple system, DSTS. A resolvable (or near resolvable) DSTS is called self-orthogonal if every pair of distinct classes in the resolution has at most one block in common. We provide several methods to construct self-orthogonal near resolvable DSTS and settle the existence of such designs for all values of $v$ with only four possible exceptions. This addresses a recent question of Bryant, Davies and Neubecker.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorems on permutations and perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado (EKR) theorem and its generalizations can be viewed as classifications of maximum independent sets in appropriately defined families of graphs, such as the Kneser graph $K(n,k)$. In this paper, we investigate the independence number of random spanning subraphs of two other families of graphs whose maximum independent sets satisfy an EKR-type characterization: the derangement graph on the set of permutations in $\mathrm{Sym}(n)$ and the derangement graph on the set $\mathcal{M}_{n}$ of perfect matchings in the complete graph $\mathcal{K}_{2n}$. In both cases, we show there is a sharp threshold probability for the event that the independence number of a random spanning subgraph is equal to that of the original graph. As a useful tool to aid our computations, we obtain a Friedgut--Kalai--Naor (FKN) type theorem on sparse boolean functions whose domain is the vertex set of $\mathcal{M}_{n}$. In particular, we show that boolean functions whose Fourier transforms are highly concentrated on the first two irreducible modules in the $\mathrm{Sym}(2n)$ module $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{M}_{n}]$, is close to being the characteristic function of a union of maximum independent sets in the derangement graph on perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>Graph polynomials: some questions on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We raise some questions about graph polynomials, highlighting concepts and phenomena that may merit consideration in the development of a general theory. Our questions are mainly of three types: When do graph polynomials have reduction relations (simple linear recursions based on local operations), perhaps in a wider class of combinatorial objects? How many levels of reduction relations does a graph polynomial need in order to express it in terms of trivial base cases? For a graph polynomial, how are properties such as equivalence and factorisation reflected in the structure of a graph? We illustrate our discussion with a variety of graph polynomials and other invariants. This leads us to reflect on the historical origins of graph polynomials. We also introduce some new polynomials based on partial colourings of graphs and establish some of their basic properties.</description>

      <title>Root polytopes, flow polytopes, and order polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of polytopes which can be obtained by taking the convex hull of some subset of the points $\{e_i-e_j \ \vert \ i \neq j\} \cup \{\pm e_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $e_1,\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Such a polytope can be encoded by a quiver $Q$ with vertices $V \subseteq \{v_1,\dots,v_n\} \cup \{\star\}$, where each edge $v_j\to v_i$ or $\star \to v_i$ or $v_i\to \star$ gives rise to the point $e_i-e_j$ or $e_i$ or $-e_i$, respectively; we denote the corresponding polytope as $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. These polytopes have been studied extensively under names such as edge polytope and root polytope. We show that if the quiver $Q$ is star-connected (or strongly-connected if there is no $\star$ vertex) then the root polytope $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is reflexive and terminal; we moreover give a combinatorial description of the facets of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. We also show that if $Q$ is planar, then $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is (integrally equivalent to the) polar dual of the flow polytope of the dual quiver $Q^{\vee}$. Finally we consider the case that $Q$ comes from the Hasse diagram of a ranked poset $P$, and show that $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is polar dual to (a translation of) a marked poset polytope. Additionally, we show that the face fan $\mathcal{F}_Q$ of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ refines the normal fan $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{O}(P))$ of the order polytope $\mathcal{O}(P)$, and when $P$ is graded, these fans coincide. We moreover give a combinatorial description of the Picard group of the toric variety associated to $\mathcal{F}_Q$ for any ranked poset $P$, in terms of a new ``canonical extension'' of $P$. These results have applications to mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension of circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A circulant graph is a Cayley graph of a finite cyclic group. The Weisfeiler-Leman-dimension of a circulant graph $X$ with respect to the class of all circulant graphs is the smallest positive integer~$m$ such that the $m$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm correctly tests the isomorphism between $X$ and any other circulant graph. It is proved that for a circulant graph of order $n$ this dimension is less than or equal to $\Omega(n)+3$, where $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime divisors of~$n$.</description>

      <title>A new condition on dominated pair degree sum for a digraph to be supereulerian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph $D$ is supereulerian if $D$ contains a spanning eulerian subdigraph.
  For any two vertices $u,v$ in a digraph $D$, if $(u,w),(v,w)\in A(D)$ for some $w\in V(D)$, then we call the pair $\{u, v\}$ dominating; if $(w,u),(w,v)\in A(D)$ for some $w\in V(D)$, then we call the pair $\{u, v\}$ dominated. In 2015, Bang-Jensen and Maddaloni [Journal of graph theory, 79(1) (2015) 8-20]
  proved that if a strong digraph $D$ with $n$ vertices satisfies
  $d(u) + d(v)\geq 2n -3$ for any pair of nonadjacent vertices $\{u,v\}$ of $D$, then $D$ is supereulerian. In this paper, we study the above degree sum condition for any pair of dominated or dominating nonadjacent vertices of supereulerian digraphs.</description>

      <title>Antidirected hamiltonian paths in $k$-hypertournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-hypertournament $H$ on $n$ vertices is a pair $(V(H),A(H))$, where $V(H)$ is a set of vertices and $A(H)$ is a set of $k$-tuples of vertices, called arcs, such that for any $k$-subset $S$ of $V(H)$, $A(H)$ contains exactly one of the $k!$ $k$-tuples whose entries belong to $S$. Clearly, a 2-hypertournament is a tournament.
  An antidirected path in $H$ is a sequence $x_1 a_1 x_2 a_2 x_3 \ldots x_{t-1} a_{t-1} x_t$ of distinct vertices $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t$ and distinct arcs $a_1, a_{2},\ldots, a_{t-1}$ such that for any $i\in \{2,3,\ldots, t-1\}$, either $x_{i-1}$ precedes $x_{i}$ in $a_{i-1}$ and $x_{i+1}$ precedes $x_{i}$ in $a_{i}$, or $x_{i}$ precedes $x_{i-1}$ in $a_{i-1}$ and $x_{i}$ precedes $x_{i+1}$ in $a_{i}$. An antidirected path that includes all vertices of $H$ is known as an antidirected hamiltonian path. In this paper, we prove that except for four hypertournaments, $T_3^{c}, T_5^{c}, T_7^{c}$ and $H_{4}$, every $k$-hypertournament with $n$ vetices, where $2\leq k\leq n-1$, has an antidirected hamiltonian path, which extends Gr\"{u}nbaum's theorem on tournaments (except for three tournaments, $T_3^{c}, T_5^{c}$ and $T_7^{c}$, every tournament has an antidirected hamiltonian path).</description>

      <title>On the Elliptic Sombor and Euler Sombor indices of Corona product of certain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic Sombor and Euler Sombor indices are recently defined topological indices using Sombor index. Elliptic sombor index is defined as $ESO(G)=\sum_{uv\in E(G)}(d_u+ d_v)\sqrt{d^2_u+ d^2_v}$ and Euler Sombor index is defined as $EU(G)= \sum_{uv\in E(G)}\sqrt{{d_{u}^2+d_{v}^2}+d_ud_v}$, where $d_u$ and $d_v$ are degrees of vertices $u$ and $v$ in graph $G$. In this article, we compute the elliptic Sombor and Euler Sombor indices of some resultant graphs. Using the operations join and Corona product on standard graphs like path, cycle and complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Nondegenerate Tur\'{a}n problems under $(t,p)$-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integers $r &gt; t \ge 1$ and a real number $p &gt; 0$, the $(t,p)$-norm $\left\lVert \mathcal{H} \right\rVert_{t,p}$ of an $r$-graph $\mathcal{H}$ is the sum of the $p$-th power of the degrees $d_{\mathcal{H}}(T)$ over all $t$-subsets $T \subset V(\mathcal{H})$. We conduct a systematic study of the Tur\'{a}n-type problem of determining $\mathrm{ex}_{t,p}(n,\mathcal{F})$, which is the maximum of $\left\lVert \mathcal{H} \right\rVert_{t,p}$ over all $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graphs $\mathcal{H}$.
  We establish several basic properties for the $(t,p)$-norm of $r$-graphs, enabling us to derive general theorems from the recently established framework in~\cite{CL24} that are useful for determining $\mathrm{ex}_{t,p}(n,\mathcal{F})$ and proving the corresponding stability.
  We determine the asymptotic value of $\mathrm{ex}_{t,p}(n,H_{F}^{r})$ for all feasible combinations of $(r,t,p)$ and for every graph $F$ with chromatic number greater than $r$, where $H_{F}^{r}$ represents the expansion of $F$. In the case where $F$ is edge-critical and $p \ge 1$, we establish strong stability and determine the exact value of $\mathrm{ex}_{t,p}(n,H_{F}^{r})$ for all sufficiently large $n$. These results extend the seminal theorems of Erd\H{o}s--Stone--Simonovits, Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s, Erd\H{o}s--Simonovits, and a classical theorem of Mubayi.
  For the $3$-uniform generalized triangle $F_5$, we determine the exact value of $\mathrm{ex}_{2,p}(n,F_5)$ for all $p \ge 1$ and its asymptotic value for all $p \in [1/2, 1]\cup \{k^{-1} \colon k \in 6\mathbb{N}^{+}+\{0,2\}\}$. This extends old theorems of Bollob\'{a}s, Frankl--F\"{u}redi, and a recent result of Balogh--Clemen--Lidick\'{y}. Our proofs utilize results on the graph inducibility problem, Steiner triple systems, and the feasible region problem introduced by Liu--Mubayi.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a very simple solitaire game, named Stanley Solitaire, in honor of Richard Stanley, and prove an explicit closed-form formula for the number of ways of playing it. Alas, the only proof that we know is via a deep theorem of Richard Stanley from 1984. We challenge the readers to find a more elementary proof.</description>

      <title>Duality for pairs of upward bipolar plane graphs and submodule lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ and $H$ be acyclic, upward bipolarly oriented plane graphs with the same number $n$ of edges. While $G$ can symbolize a flow network, $H$ has only a controlling role. Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be bijections from $\{1, \dots, n\}$ to the edge set of $G$ and that of $H$, respectively; their role is to define, for each edge of $H$, the corresponding edge of $G$. Let $b$ be an element of an Abelian group $\mathbb A$. An $n$-tuple $(a_1$, $\dots$, $a_n)$ of elements of $\mathbb A$ is a solution of the paired-bipolar-graphs problem $P:=(G,H$, $\phi,\psi$, $\mathbb A, b)$ if whenever $a_i$ is the ``all-or-nothing-flow'' capacity of the edge $\phi(i)$ for $i=1, \dots, n$ and $\vec e$ is a maximal directed path of $H$, then by fully exploiting the capacities of the edges corresponding to the edges of $\vec e$ and neglecting the rest of the edges of $G$, we have a flow process transporting $b$ from the source (vertex) of $G$ to the sink of $G$. Let $P':=(H',G'$, $\psi',\phi'$, $\mathbb A, b)$, where $H'$ and $G'$ are the ``two-outer-facet'' duals of $H$ and $G$, respectively, and $\psi'$ and $\phi'$ are defined naturally. We prove that $P$ and $P'$ have the same solutions. This result implies George Hutchinson's self-duality theorem on submodule lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring with unity and $x$ be a non-zero element of $R$. In this paper, we calculate the spectrum and energy of the Cayley graph ${\rm Cay}(R,xR^{*})$, and also compute the energy of their compliment graph. It generalizes to Theorem 2.4 and Theorem 4.1 of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2011.03.015. Further, we characterize the commutative ring $R$ such that the Cayley graph ${\rm Cay}(R,xR^{*})$ is Ramanujan. This generalizes to Theorem 12 of https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1205.5932.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive integers $t$, let $P_{t,2}$ be the digraph consisting of $t$ directed paths of length 2 with the same initial and terminal vertices. In this paper, we study the maximum size of $P_{t+1,2}$-free digraphs of order $n$, which is denoted by $ex(n, P_{t+1})$. For sufficiently large $n$, we prove that $ex(n, P_{t+1})=g(n,t)$ when $\lfloor(n-t)/{2} \rfloor$ is odd and $ex(n, P_{t+1})\in \{g(n,t)-1, g(n,t)\}$ when $\lfloor(n-t)/{2} \rfloor$ is even, where $g(n,t)=\left\lceil(n+t)/{2}\right\rceil \left\lfloor(n-t)/{2}\right\rfloor+tn+1$.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Curve Neighborhood of the Affine Flag Manifold of Type $A_{n-1}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{X}$ be the affine flag manifold of Lie type $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$ where $n \geq 3$ and let $W_{\text{aff}}$ be the associated affine Weyl group. The moment graph for $\mathscr{X}$ encodes the torus fixed points (corresponding to elements of the affine Weyl group $W_{\text{aff}}$) and the torus stable curves in $\mathscr{X}$. Given a fixed point $u\in W_{\text{aff}}$ and a degree $\mathbf{d}=(d_0,d_1,...,d_{n-1})\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^{n}$, the combinatorial curve neighborhood is the set of maximal elements in the moment graph of $\mathscr{X}$ which can be reached from $u'\leq u$ by a chain of curves of total degree $\leq \mathbf{d}$. In this paper we give combinatorial formulas and algorithms for calculating these elements in $\mathscr{X}$.</description>

      <title>Recursions Satisfied by Families of Determinants with Applications to Resistance Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is a six-step semi-automatic algorithm that obtains a recursion satisfied by a family of determinants by systematically and iteratively applying Laplace expansion to the underlying matrix family. The recursion allows explicit computation of the Binet form providing a closed formula for resistance distance between two specified nodes in a family of graphs. This approach is particularly suited for graph families with complex structures; the method is used to prove the 1 over 14 conjectured asymptotic formula for linear 3--trees. Additionally, although the literature on recursive formulas for resistance distances is quite large, the Fibonacci Quarterly and the Proceedings have almost no such results despite the fact that many recursions related to resistance distances involve the Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, a secondary purpose of the paper is to provide a brief introductory survey of graph families, accompanied by figures, Laplacian matrices, and typical recursive results, supported by a modest bibliography of current papers on many relevant graph families, in the hope to involve Fibonaccians in this active and beautiful field.</description>

      <title>Power Quotients of Plactic-like Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the quotients of several plactic-like monoids by the least congruences containing the relations $a^{\sigma(a)} = a$ with $\sigma(a)\ge 2$ for every generator $a$. The starting point for this description is the recent paper of Abram and Reutenauer about the so-called stylic monoid which happens to be the quotient of the plactic monoid by the relations $a^2 = a$ for every letter $a$. The plactic-like monoids considered are the plactic monoid itself, the Chinese monoid, and the sylvester monoid. In each case we describe: a set of normal forms, and the idempotents; and obtain formulae for their size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system of affine type D, and let TL(W) the corresponding generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra. In this extended abstract we define an infinite dimensional associative algebra made of decorated diagrams which is isomorphic to TL(W). Moreover, we describe an explicit basis for such an algebra of diagrams which is in bijective correspondence with the classical monomial basis of TL(W), indexed by the fully commutative elements of W.

      <title>Bijective Enumeration and Sign-Imbalance for Permutation Depth and Excedances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simplified variant of Biane's bijection between permutations and 3-colored Motzkin paths with weight that keeps track of the inversion number, excedance number and a statistic so-called depth of a permutation. This generalizes a result by Guay-Paquet and Petersen about a continued fraction of the generating function for depth on the permutations of n elements. In terms of weighted Motzkin path, we establish an involution on the permutations that reverses the parities of depth and excedance numbers simultaneously, which proves that the numbers of permutations with even and odd depth (excedance numbers, respectively) are equal if n is even and differ by the tangent number if n is odd. Moreover, we present some interesting sign-imbalance results on permutations and derangements, refined with respect to depth and excedance numbers.</description>

Abstract: We give bijective results between several variants of lattice paths of length $2n$ (or $2n-2$) and integer compositions of n, all enumerated by the seemingly innocuous formula $4^{n-1}$.

      <description>arXiv:2406.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new characterization of Lyndon words that are also perfectly clustering was proposed by Lapointe and Reutenauer (2024). A word over a ternary alphabet {a,b,c} is called perfectly clustering Lyndon if and only if it is the product of two palindromes and it can be written as apbqc where p and q are palindromes. We study the properties of palindromes appearing as factors p and q and their links with iterated palindromes over a ternary alphabet.

      <description>arXiv:2406.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computationally completely enumerate a number of types of row-column designs up to isotopism, including double, sesqui and triple arrays as known from the literature, and two newly introduced types that we call mono arrays and AO-arrays. We calculate autotopism group sizes for the designs we generate. For larger parameter values, where complete enumeration is not feasible, we generate examples of some of the designs, and generate exhaustive lists of admissible parameters. For some admissible parameter sets, we prove non-existence results. We also give some explicit constructions of sesqui arrays, mono arrays and AO-arrays, and investigate connections to Youden rectangles and binary pseud Youden designs.</description>

      <title>Strictly critical snarks with girth or cyclic connectivity equal to 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A snark -- connected cubic graph with chromatic index $4$ -- is critical if the graph resulting from the removal of any pair of distinct adjacent vertices is $3$-edge-colourable; it is bicritical if the same is true for any pair of distinct vertices. A snark is strictly critical if it is critical but not bicritical. Very little is known about strictly critical snarks. Computational evidence suggests that strictly critical snarks constitute a tiny minority of all critical snarks. Strictly critical snarks of order $n$ exist if and only if $n$ is even and at least 32, and for each such order there is at least one strictly critical snark with cyclic connectivity $4$. A sparse infinite family of cyclically $5$-connected strictly critical snarks is also known, but those with cyclic connectivity greater than $5$ have not been discovered so far. In this paper we fill the gap by constructing cyclically $6$-connected strictly critical snarks of each even order $n\ge 342$. In addition, we construct cyclically $5$-connected strictly critical snarks of girth 6 for every even $n\ge 66$ with $n\equiv 2\pmod8$.</description>

      <title>Delineating Half-Integrality of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa Property for Minors: the Case of Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1986 Robertson and Seymour proved a generalization of the seminal result of Erd\H{o}s and P\'osa on the duality of packing and covering cycles: A graph has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors if and only if it is planar. In particular, for every non-planar graph $H$ they gave examples showing that the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property does not hold for $H.$ Recently, Liu confirmed a conjecture of Thomas and showed that every graph has the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors. Liu's proof is non-constructive and to this date, with the exception of a small number of examples, no constructive proof is known.
  In this paper, we initiate the delineation of the half-integrality of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors. We conjecture that for every graph $H,$ there exists a unique (up to a suitable equivalence relation) graph parameter ${\textsf{EP}}_H$ such that $H$ has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property in a minor-closed graph class $\mathcal{G}$ if and only if $\sup\{\textsf{EP}_H(G) \mid G\in\mathcal{G}\}$ is finite. We prove this conjecture for the class $\mathcal{H}$ of Kuratowski-connected shallow-vortex minors by showing that, for every non-planar $H\in\mathcal{H},$ the parameter ${\sf EP}_H(G)$ is precisely the maximum order of a Robertson-Seymour counterexample to the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of $H$ which can be found as a minor in $G.$ Our results are constructive and imply, for the first time, parameterized algorithms that find either a packing, or a cover, or one of the Robertson-Seymour counterexamples, certifying the existence of a half-integral packing for the graphs in $\mathcal{H}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. A set $I_0(G) \subseteq V(G)$ is a vertex independent set if no two vertices in $I_0(G)$ are adjacent in $G$. We study $\alpha_1(G)$, which is the maximum cardinality of a set $I_1(G) \subseteq V(G)$ that contains exactly one pair of adjacent vertices of $G$. We call $I_1(G)$ a $1$-nearly vertex independent set of $G$ and $\alpha_1(G)$ a $1$-nearly vertex independence number of $G$. We provide some cases of explicit formulas for $\alpha_1$. Furthermore, we prove a tight lower (resp. upper) bound on $\alpha_1$ for graphs of order $n$. The extremal graphs that achieve equality on each bound are fully characterised.</description>

If $S \subseteq G$ is a random set of size $k$, with $k \geq (\log n)^{1+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon &gt;0$, then the diameter of the corresponding Schreier graph is $O(\log_k n)$ with high probability.

Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>

      <title>Weak recovery, hypothesis testing, and mutual information in stochastic block models and planted factor graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is a canonical model of communities in random graphs. It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity?
  In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic mutual information between the observed network and the community structure exhibits a phase transition at the weak recovery threshold.
  Our results are proven in much broader settings including the hypergraph stochastic block models and general planted factor graphs. In these settings we prove that the impossibility of weak recovery implies contiguity and provide a condition which guarantees the equivalence of weak recovery and detection.</description>

      <title>Formula Size-Depth Tradeoffs for Iterated Sub-Permutation Matrix Multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formula complexity of Iterated Sub-Permutation Matrix Multiplication, the logspace-complete problem of computing the product of $k$ $n$-by-$n$ Boolean matrices with at most a single $1$ in each row and column. For all $d \le \log k$, this problem is solvable by $n^{O(dk^{1/d})}$ size monotone formulas of two distinct types: (unbounded fan-in) $AC^0$ formulas of depth $d+1$ and (semi-unbounded fan-in) $SAC^0$ formulas of $\bigwedge$-depth $d$ and $\bigwedge$-fan-in $k^{1/d}$. The results of this paper give matching $n^{\Omega(dk^{1/d})}$ lower bounds for monotone $AC^0$ and $SAC^0$ formulas for all $k \le \log\log n$, as well as slightly weaker $n^{\Omega(dk^{1/2d})}$ lower bounds for non-monotone $AC^0$ and $SAC^0$ formulas. These size-depth tradeoffs converge at $d = \log k$ to tight $n^{\Omega(\log k)}$ lower bounds for both unbounded-depth monotone formulas [Ros15] and bounded-depth non-monotone formulas [Ros18]. Our non-monotone lower bounds extend to the more restricted Iterated Permutation Matrix Multiplication problem, improving the previous $n^{k^{1/\exp(O(d))}}$ tradeoff for this problem [BIP98].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rota used the functional L to recover old properties and obtain some new formulas for the Bell numbers. Tanny used Rota's functional L and the celebrated Worpitzky identity to obtain some expression for the ordered Bell numbers, which can be seen as an evident to the fact that the ordered Bell numbers are gamma-positive. In this paper, we extend some of Rota's and Tanny's results to the framework of the set partitions of Coxeter type B.</description>

Abstract: We consider Dyck paths having height at most two with some constraints on the number of consecutive valleys at height one which must be followed by a suitable number of valleys at height zero. We prove that they are enumerated by so-called Q-bonacci numbers (recently introduced by Kirgizov) which generalize the classical q-bonacci numbers in the case where q is a positive rational.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation codes in the Ulam metric, which can correct multiple deletions, have been investigated extensively recently owing to their applications. In this work, we are interested in the maximum size of the permutation codes in the Ulam metric and aim to design permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions with efficient decoding algorithms. We first present an improvement on the Gilbert--Varshamov bound of the maximum size of these permutation codes which is the best-known lower bound. Next, we focus on designing permutation codes in the Ulam metric with a decoding algorithm. These constructed codes are the best-known permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions. In particular, the constructed permutation codes can correct $t$ deletions with at most $(3t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits of redundancy where $n$ is the length of the code. Finally, we provide an efficient decoding algorithm for our constructed permutation codes.</description>

      <title>Beyond uniform cyclotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclotomy, the study of cyclotomic classes and cyclotomic numbers, is an area of number theory first studied by Gauss. It has natural applications in discrete mathematics and information theory. Despite this long history, there are significant limitations to what is known explicitly about cyclotomic numbers, which limits the use of cyclotomy in applications. The main explicit tool available is that of uniform cyclotomy, introduced by Baumert, Mills and Ward in 1982. In this paper, we present an extension of uniform cyclotomy which gives a direct method for evaluating all cyclotomic numbers over $GF(q^n)$ of order dividing $(q^n-1)/(q-1)$, for any prime power $q$ and $n \geq 2$, which does not use character theory nor direct calculation in the field. This allows the straightforward evaluation of many cyclotomic numbers for which other methods are unknown or impractical. Our methods exploit connections between cyclotomy, Singer difference sets and finite geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.11266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a refinement of the flat wall theorem of Robertson and Seymour to undirected group-labelled graphs $(G,\gamma)$ where $\gamma$ assigns to each edge of an undirected graph $G$ an element of an abelian group $\Gamma$. As a consequence, we prove that $\Gamma$-nonzero cycles (cycles whose edges sum to a non-identity element of $\Gamma$) satisfy the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property, and we also recover a result of Wollan that, if $\Gamma$ has no element of order two, then $\Gamma$-nonzero cycles satisfy the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. As another application, we prove that if $m$ is an odd prime power, then cycles of length $\ell \mod m$ satisfy the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for all integers $\ell$. This partially answers a question of Dejter and Neumann-Lara from 1987 on characterizing all such integer pairs $(\ell,m)$.</description>

Abstract: It is known that $A$-paths of length $0$ mod $m$ satisfy the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property if $m=2$ or $m=4$, but not if $m &gt; 4$ is composite. We show that if $p$ is prime, then $A$-paths of length $0$ mod $p$ satisfy the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. More generally, in the framework of undirected group-labelled graphs, we characterize the abelian groups $\Gamma$ and elements $\ell \in \Gamma$ for which the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property holds for $A$-paths of weight $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Limiting Behavior of Resistances in Triangular Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.01959v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barrett et al studied resistance labels of electrical circuits whose underlying graphs when embedded in the Cartesian plane has the form of an $n$-grid, $n$ rows of upright triangles. Proofs in Barrett introduced a row-reduction algorithm which uses series, $\Delta$--Y, and Y--$\Delta$ electric transformations to transform an $n$-grid into an $n-1$ grid with equivalent resistances between specified nodes. This paper explores this row-reduction algorithm computationally. The introductory part of the paper presents several conjectures supported by numerical evidence, showing that repeated application of the row-reduction algorithm to an initial $n$-grid uniformly labeled 1 asymptotically produces triangular grids whose sides are labeled with rational multiples of $\frac{1}{e};$ moreover, the ratio of specified consecutive edges in the row-reduced grids are asymptotically described by four rational functions. The main part of this paper studies a family of graphs whose edge labels are determined using these limiting edge-ratios functions arising in the conjectures. The main result proven is that these $n$-grids and their repeated reductions under the row-reduction algorithm possess vertical and rotational symmetries and satisfy the relationships captured by the four edge-ratio functions. Thus, the limiting edge-ratio relationships are local algebraic relationships mirroring the global vertical and rotational symmetries possessed by the underlying graph. Additionally, because row-reduction is local (in contrast to the combinatoric Laplacian which is global) the paper is able to introduce a mechanical verification method of proof for assertions about effective resistance identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Evans, Francis 2022; Hendel] the authors investigated resistance distance in triangular grid graphs and observed several types of asymptotic behavior. This paper extends their work by studying the initial, non-asymptotic, behavior found when equivalent circuit transformations are performed, reducing the rows in the triangular grid graph one row at a time. The main conjecture characterizes, after reducing an arbitrary number of times an initial triangular grid all of whose edge resistances are identically one, when edge resistance values are less than, equal to, or greater than one. A special case of the conjecture is proven. The main theorem identifies patterns of repeating edge resistances arising in diagonals of a triangular grid reduced $s$ times provided the original grid has at least $4s$ rows of triangles. This paper also improves upon the notation, concepts, and proof techniques introduced by the authors previously.</description>

Abstract: We describe a natural geometric relationship between matroids and underlying flag matroids by relating the geometry of the greedy algorithm to monotone path polytopes. This perspective allows us to generalize the construction of underlying flag matroids to polymatroids. We show that the polytopes associated to underlying flag polymatroid are simple by proving that they are normally equivalent to certain nestohedra. We use this to show that polymatroids realized by subspace arrangements give rise to smooth toric varieties in flag varieties and we interpret our construction in terms of toric quotients. We give various examples that illustrate the rich combinatorial structure of flag polymatroids. Finally, we study general monotone paths on polymatroid polytopes, that relate to the enumeration of certain Young tableaux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04783v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known that the following basic objects are obstructions to bounded tree-width: for arbitrarily large $t$, $(1)$ the complete graph $K_t$, $(2)$ the complete bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$, $(3)$ a subdivision of the $(t \times t)$-wall and $(4)$ the line graph of a subdivision of the $(t \times t)$-wall. We now add a further \emph{boundary object} to this list, a \emph{$t$-sail}.
  These results have been obtained by studying sparse hereditary \emph{path-star} graph classes, each of which consists of the finite induced subgraphs of a single infinite graph whose edges can be partitioned into a path (or forest of paths) with a forest of stars, characterised by an infinite word over a possibly infinite alphabet. We show that a path-star class whose infinite graph has an unbounded number of stars, each of which connects an unbounded number of times to the path, has unbounded tree-width. In addition, we show that such a class is not a subclass of the hereditary class of circle graphs.
  We identify a collection of \emph{nested} words with a recursive structure that exhibit interesting characteristics when used to define a path-star graph class. These graph classes do not contain any of the four basic obstructions but instead contain graphs that have large tree-width if and only if they contain arbitrarily large $t$-sails. We show that these classes are infinitely defined and, like classes of bounded degree or classes excluding a fixed minor, do not contain a minimal class of unbounded tree-width.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Analysis of the Koml\'os Conjecture: Rademacher Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06285v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\em discrepancy} of a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is given by $\mathrm{DISC}(M) := \min_{\boldsymbol{x} \in \{-1,1\}^n} \|M\boldsymbol{x}\|_\infty$. An outstanding conjecture, attributed to Koml\'os, stipulates that $\mathrm{DISC}(M) = O(1)$, whenever $M$ is a Koml\'os matrix, that is, whenever every column of $M$ lies within the unit sphere. Our main result asserts that $\mathrm{DISC}(M + R/\sqrt{d}) = O(d^{-1/2})$ holds asymptotically almost surely, whenever $M \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is Koml\'os, $R \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ is a Rademacher random matrix, $d = \omega(1)$, and $n = \omega(d \log d)$. The factor $d^{-1/2}$ normalising $R$ is essentially best possible and the dependency between $n$ and $d$ is asymptotically best possible. Our main source of inspiration is a result by Bansal, Jiang, Meka, Singla, and Sinha (ICALP 2022). They obtained an assertion similar to the one above in the case that the smoothing matrix is Gaussian. They asked whether their result can be attained with the optimal dependency $n = \omega(d \log d)$ in the case of Bernoulli random noise or any other types of discretely distributed noise; the latter types being more conducive for Smoothed Analysis in other discrepancy settings such as the Beck-Fiala problem. For Bernoulli noise, their method works if $n = \omega(d^2)$. In the case of Rademacher noise, we answer the question posed by Bansal, Jiang, Meka, Singla, and Sinha. Our proof builds upon their approach in a strong way and provides a discrete version of the latter. Breaking the $n = \omega(d^2)$ barrier and reaching the optimal dependency $n = \omega(d \log d)$ for Rademacher noise requires additional ideas expressed through a rather meticulous counting argument, incurred by the need to maintain a high level of precision all throughout the discretisation process.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of extending partial edge colorings of (iterated) cartesian products of even cycles and paths, focusing on the case when the precolored edges constitute a matching. We prove the conjecture of Casselgren, Granholm and Petros that a precolored distance 3 matching in the Cartesian product of two even cycles can be extended to a 4-coloring of the edge set of the whole graph. Actually, a generalization for the Cartesian product of two bipartite graphs is proved.</description>

      <title>Joint distributions of statistics over permutations avoiding two patterns of length 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding distributions of permutation statistics over pattern-avoiding classes of permutations attracted much attention in the literature. In particular, Bukata et al. found distributions of ascents and descents on permutations avoiding any two patterns of length 3. In this paper, we generalize these results in two different ways: we find explicit formulas for the joint distribution of six statistics (asc, des, lrmax, lrmin, rlmax, rlmin), and also explicit formulas for the joint distribution of four statistics (asc, des, MNA, MND) on these permutations in all cases. The latter result also extends the recent studies by Kitaev and Zhang of the statistics MNA and MND (related to non-overlapping occurrences of ascents and descents) on stack-sortable permutations. All multivariate generating functions in our paper are rational, and we provide combinatorial proofs of five equidistribution results that can be derived from the generating functions.</description>

      <title>Independent domination in the graph defined by two consecutive levels of the $n$-cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a positive integer $n$ and consider the bipartite graph whose vertices are the $3$-element subsets and the $2$-element subsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, and there is an edge between $A$ and $B$ if $A\subset B$. We prove that the domination number of this graph is $\binom{n}{2}-\lfloor\frac{(n+1)^2}{8}\rfloor$, we characterize the dominating sets of minimum size, and we observe that the minimum size dominating set can be chosen as an independent set. This is an exact version of an asymptotic result by Balogh, Katona, Linz and Tuza (2021). For the corresponding bipartite graph between the $(k+1)$-element subsets and the $k$-elements subsets of $[n]$ ($k\geq 3$), we provide a new construction for small independent dominating sets. This improves on a construction by Gerbner, Kezegh, Lemons, Palmer, P\'alv\"olgyi and Patk\'os (2012), who studied these independent dominating sets under the name saturating flat antichains.</description>

      <title>On degree-$3$ and $(n-4)$-correlation-immune perfect colorings of $n$-cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A perfect $k$-coloring of the Boolean hypercube $Q_n$ is a function from the set of binary words of length $n$ onto a $k$-set of colors such that for any colors $i$ and $j$ every word of color $i$ has exactly $S(i,j)$ neighbors (at Hamming distance $1$) of color $j$, where the coefficient $S(i,j)$ depends only on $i$ and $j$ but not on the particular choice of the word. The $k$-by-$k$ table of all coefficients $S(i,j)$ is called the quotient matrix. We characterize perfect colorings of $Q_n$ of degree at most $3$, that is, with quotient matrix whose all eigenvalues are not less than $n-6$, or, equivalently, such that every color corresponds to a Boolean function represented by a polynomial of degree at most $3$ over $R$. Additionally, we characterize $(n-4)$-correlation-immune perfect colorings of $Q_n$, whose all colors correspond to $(n-4)$-correlation-immune Boolean functions, or, equivalently, all non-main (different from $n$) eigenvalues of the quotient matrix are not greater than $6-n$.
  Keywords: perfect coloring, equitable partition, resilient function, correlation-immune function.</description>

      <title>Ramsey goodness of $k$-uniform paths, or the lack thereof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pair of $k$-uniform hypergraphs $(G,H)$, the Ramsey number of $(G,H)$, denoted by $R(G,H)$, is the smallest integer $n$ such that in every red/blue-colouring of the edges of $K_n^{(k)}$ there exists a red copy of $G$ or a blue copy of $H$. Burr showed that, for any pair of graphs $(G,H)$, where $G$ is large and connected, $R(G,H) \geq (v(G)-1)(\chi(H)-1)+\sigma(H)$, where $\sigma(H)$ stands for the minimum size of a colour class over all proper $\chi(H)$-colourings of $H$. We say that $G$ is $H$-good if $R(G,H)$ is equal to the general lower bound. Burr showed that, for any graph~$H$, every sufficiently long path is $H$-good.
  Our goal is to explore the notion of Ramsey goodness in the setting of $k$-uniform hypergraphs. We demonstrate that, in stark contrast to the graph case, $k$-uniform $\ell$-paths are not $H$-good for a large class of $k$-graphs. On the other hand, we prove that long loose paths are always at least asymptotically $H$-good for every $H$ and derive lower and upper bounds that are best possible in a certain sense.
  In the 3-uniform setting, we complement our negative result with a positive one, in which we determine the Ramsey number asymptotically for pairs containing a long tight path and a 3-graph $H$ when $H$ belongs to a certain family of hypergraphs. This extends a result of Balogh, Clemen, Skokan, and Wagner for the Fano plane asymptotically to a much larger family of 3-graphs.</description>

      <title>The Combinatorics of Motzkin Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A word $w=w_1\cdots w_n$ over the set of positive integers is a Motzkin word whenever $w_1=\texttt{1}$, $1\leq w_k\leq w_{k-1}+1$, and $w_{k-1}\neq w_{k}$ for $k=2, \dots, n$. It can be associated to a $n$-column Motzkin polyomino whose $i$-th column contains $w_i$ cells, and all columns are bottom-justified. We reveal bijective connections between Motzkin paths, restricted Catalan words, primitive \L{}ukasiewicz paths, and Motzkin polyominoes. Using the aforementioned bijections together with classical one-to-one correspondence with Dyck paths avoiding $UDU$s, we provide generating functions with respect to the length, area, semiperimeter, value of the last symbol, and number of interior points of Motzkin polyominoes. We give asymptotics and closed-form expressions for the total area, total semiperimeter, sum of the last symbol values, and total number of interior points over all Motzkin polyominoes of a given length. We also present and prove an engaging trinomial relation concerning the number of cells lying at different levels and first terms of the expanded $(1+x+x^2)^n$.</description>

      <title>Large recurrence of the polynomial Van der Waerden's theorem and its application in Ramsey theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently M. Di Nasso and M. Ragosta proved an exponential version of Hindman's finite sum theorem: for every finite partition of $\mathbb{N}$, there exists a monochromatic Hindman tower of a single sequence. They used the stronger version of Furstenberg's Central Sets Theorem and the theory of ultrafilters to prove their results. In this article, we prove these patterns are abundant by considering two-fold extensions of the Di Nasso-Ragosta theorem. We prove that each term of this pattern can be chosen from a finite set of any given length, consisting of a multiplicative $IP_r$ (that we will define later) set and a set consisting of geometric progression (sets containing both arithmetic and geometric progression) of finite length.
  To prove our result, first, we improve the size of the recurrence set of V. Bergelson and A. Leibmann's polynomial Van der Waerden's Theorem, and then we study its two-fold applications. First, we study monochromatic patterns involving polynomials over sum sets in additive piecewise syndetic sets. Then in the second, applying methods of induction, we construct infinitary patterns involving a two-fold improvement of the Di Nasso-Ragosta theorem. Then we study the properties of some special classes of ultrafilters witnessing variants of these patterns. Throughout our article, we use the methods from the Algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech-Compactification of discrete semigroups (for details see [N. Hindman and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification. Walter de Gruyter\&amp; Co., Berlin, 2012.]).</description>

Abstract: We call progressive paths and rushed paths two families of Dyck paths studied by Asinowski and Jelinek, which have the same enumerating sequence (OEIS entry A287709). We present a bijection proving this fact. Rushed paths turn out to be in bijection with one-sided trees, introduced by Durhuus and Unel, which have an asymptotic enumeration involving a stretched exponential. We conclude by presenting several other classes of related lattice paths and directed animals that may have similar asymptotic properties.</description>

      <title>New bounds on a generalization of Tuza's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, let $\nu^{(m)}(H)$ denote the maximum size of a set $S$ of edges of $H$ whose pairwise intersection has size less than $m$. Let $\tau^{(m)}(H)$ denote the minimum size of a set $S$ of $m$-sets of $V(H)$ such that every edge of $H$ contains some $m$-set from $S$. A conjecture by Aharoni and Zerbib, which generalizes a conjecture of Tuza on the size of minimum edge covers of triangles of a graph, states that for a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$, $\tau^{(k - 1)}(H)/\nu^{(k - 1)}(H) \leq \left \lceil \frac{k + 1}{2} \right \rceil$. In this paper, we show that this generalization of Tuza's conjecture holds when $\nu^{(k - 1)}(H) \leq 3$. As a corollary, we obtain a graph class which satisfies Tuza's conjecture. We also prove various bounds on $\tau^{(m)}(H)/\nu^{(m)}(H)$ for other values of $m$ as well as some bounds on the fractional analogues of these numbers.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Tur\'an systems that are tight up to a multiplicative constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $n\ge s&gt; r$, the Tur\'an function $T(n,s,r)$ is the smallest size of an r-graph with n vertices such that every set of s vertices contains at least one edge. Also, define the Tur\'an density $t(s,r)$ as the limit of $T(n,s,r)/ {n\choose r}$ as $n\to\infty$. The question of estimating these parameters received a lot of attention after it was first raised by Tur\'an in 1941. A trivial lower bound is $t(s,r)\ge 1/{s\choose s-r}$. In the early 1990s, de Caen conjectured that $r\cdot t(r+1,r)\to\infty$ as $r\to\infty$ and offered 500 Canadian dollars for resolving this question.
  We disprove this conjecture by showing more strongly that for every integer $R\ge1$ there is $\mu_R$ (in fact, $\mu_R$ can be taken to grow as $(1+o(1))\, R\ln R$) such that $t(r+R,r)\le (\mu_R+o(1))/ {r+R\choose R}$ as $r\to\infty$, that is, the trivial lower bound is tight for every $R$ up to a multiplicative constant $\mu_R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type $A$ Kostant partition function is an important combinatorial object with various applications: it counts integer flows on the complete directed graph, computes Hilbert series of spaces of diagonal harmonics, and can be used to compute weight and tensor product multiplicities of representations. In this paper we study asymptotics of the Kostant partition function, improving on various previously known lower bounds and settling conjectures of O'Neill and Yip. Our methods build upon recent results and techniques of Br\"and\'en-Leake-Pak, who used Lorentzian polynomials and Gurvits' capacity method to bound the number of lattice points of transportation and flow polytopes. Finally, we also give new two-sided bounds using the Lidskii formulas from subdivisions of flow polytopes.</description>

      <title>On maximizing the number of heads when you need to set aside at least one coin every round</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: You play the following game: you start out with $n$ coins that all have probability $p$ to land heads. You toss all of them and you then need to set aside at least one of them, which will not be tossed again. Now you repeat the process with the remaining coins. This continues (for at most $n$ rounds) until all coins have been set aside. Your goal is to maximize the total number of heads you end up with. In this paper we will prove that there exists a constant $p_0 \approx 0.5495021777642$ such that, if $p_0 &lt; p \le 1$ and the number of remaining coins is large enough, then it is optimal to set aside exactly one coin every round, unless all coins landed heads. When $\frac{1}{2} \le p \le p_0$, it is optimal to set aside exactly one coin every round, unless at most one coin came up tails. Let $v_{n,p}$ be the expected number of heads you obtain when using the optimal strategy. We will show that $v_{n,p}$ is larger than or equal to $v_{n-1,p} + 1$ for all $n \ge 3$ and all $p \ge \frac{1}{2}$. When $p &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ there are infinitely many $n$ for which this inequality does not hold. Finally, we will see that for every $p$ with $0 &lt; p \le 1$ the sequence $n - v_{n,p}$ is convergent.</description>

Abstract: We extend classical estimates for the vector balancing constant of $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with the Euclidean and the maximum norms proved in the 1980's by showing that for $p =2$ and $p=\infty$, given vector families $V_1, \ldots, V_n \subset B_p^d$ with $0 \in \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{conv}\, V_i$, one may select vectors $v_i \in V_i$ with $ \| v_1 + \ldots + v_n \|_2 \leq \sqrt{d}$ for $p=2$, and $ \| v_1 + \ldots + v_n \|_\infty \leq O(\sqrt{d}) $ for $p = \infty$. These bounds are sharp and asymptotically sharp, respectively, for $n \geq d$. The proofs combine linear algebraic and probabilistic methods with a Gaussian random walk argument.</description>

      <title>Meeting, coalescence and consensus time on random directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Markovian dynamics on a typical realization of the so-called Directed Configuration Model (DCM), that is, a random directed graph with prescribed in- and out-degrees. In this random geometry, we study the meeting time of two random walks on a typical realization of the graph starting at stationarity, the coalescence time for a system of coalescent random walks, and the consensus time of the voter model. Indeed, it is known that the latter three quantities are related to each other when the underlying sequence of graphs satisfies certain mean field conditions. Such conditions can be summarized by requiring a fast mixing time of the random walk and some anti-concentration of its stationary distribution: properties that a typical random directed graph is known to have under natural assumptions on the degree sequence. In this paper we show that, for a typical large graph from the DCM ensemble, the distribution of the meeting time is well-approximated by an exponential random variable and we provide the first-order approximation of its expectation, showing that the latter is linear in the size of the graph, and the preconstant depends on some easy statistics of the degree sequence. As a byproduct, we are able to analyze the effect of the degree sequence in changing the meeting, coalescence and consensus time. Our approach follows the classical idea of converting meeting into hitting times of a proper collapsed chain, which we control by the so-called First Visit Time Lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical semigroups with multiplicity $m$ are parameterized by integer points in a polyhedral cone $C_m$, according to Kunz. For the toric ideal of any such semigroup, the main result here constructs a free resolution whose overall structure is identical for all semigroups parametrized by the relative interior of a fixed face of $C_m$. The matrix entries of this resolution are monomials whose exponents are parametrized by the coordinates of the corresponding point in $C_m$, and minimality of the resolution is achieved when the semigroup is maximal embedding dimension, which is the case parametrized by the interior of $C_m$ itself.</description>
