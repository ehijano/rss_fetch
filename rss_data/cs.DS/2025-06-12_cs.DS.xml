      <title>Tight Paths and Tight Pairs in Weighted Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We state the graph-theoretic computational problem of finding tight paths in a directed, edge-weighted graph, as well as its simplification of finding tight pairs. These problems are motivated by the need of algorithms that find so-called basic antecedents in closure spaces, in one specific approach to data analysis. We discuss and compare several algorithms to approach these problems.</description>

      <title>Almost-Optimal Local-Search Methods for Sparse Tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local-search methods are widely employed in statistical applications, yet interestingly, their theoretical foundations remain rather underexplored, compared to other classes of estimators such as low-degree polynomials and spectral methods. Of note, among the few existing results recent studies have revealed a significant "local-computational" gap in the context of a well-studied sparse tensor principal component analysis (PCA), where a broad class of local Markov chain methods exhibits a notable underperformance relative to other polynomial-time algorithms. In this work, we propose a series of local-search methods that provably "close" this gap to the best known polynomial-time procedures in multiple regimes of the model, including and going beyond the previously studied regimes in which the broad family of local Markov chain methods underperforms. Our framework includes: (1) standard greedy and randomized greedy algorithms applied to the (regularized) posterior of the model; and (2) novel random-threshold variants, in which the randomized greedy algorithm accepts a proposed transition if and only if the corresponding change in the Hamiltonian exceeds a random Gaussian threshold-rather that if and only if it is positive, as is customary. The introduction of the random thresholds enables a tight mathematical analysis of the randomized greedy algorithm's trajectory by crucially breaking the dependencies between the iterations, and could be of independent interest to the community.</description>

      <title>Improved Combinatorial Approximations for Weighted Correlation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09638v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present combinatorial approximation algorithms for the weighted correlation clustering problem. In this problem, we have a set of vertices and two weight values for each pair of vertices, denoting their difference and similarity. The goal is to cluster the vertices with minimum total intra-cluster difference weights plus inter-cluster similarity weights. We present two results for weighted instances with $n$ vertices: - A randomized 3-approximation combinatorial algorithm for weighted instances satisfying probability constraints, running in $O(n^2)$ time. This improves the $O(n^6)$ running time of the previous best combinatorial 3-approximation (Chawla et al. 2015). - A randomized 1.6-approximation combinatorial algorithm for weighted instances satisfying both probability and triangle inequality constraints, running in $O(n^2)$ time. This improves the longstanding 2-approximation of Ailon et al. (2008) while matching its runtime.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the number of rounds of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm required for guaranteed approximation ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm, also known in its generalization as the quantum alternating operator ansatz, (QAOA) is a heuristic hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for finding high-quality approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, such as maximum satisfiability. While the QAOA is well studied, theoretical results as to its runtime or approximation ratio guarantees are still relatively sparse. We provide some of the first lower bounds for the number of rounds (the dominant component of QAOA runtimes) required for the QAOA. For our main result, we (i) leverage a connection between quantum annealing times and the angles of the QAOA to derive a lower bound on the number of rounds of the QAOA with respect to the guaranteed approximation ratio. We apply and calculate this bound with Grover-style mixing unitaries and (ii) show that this type of QAOA requires at least a polynomial number of rounds to guarantee any constant approximation ratios for most problems. We also (iii) show that the bound depends only on the statistical values of the objective functions, and when the problem can be modeled as a $k$-local Hamiltonian, can be easily estimated from the coefficients of the Hamiltonians. For the conventional transverse-field mixer, (iv) our framework gives a trivial lower bound to all bounded-occurrence local cost problems and for all strictly $k$-local cost Hamiltonians matching known results that constant approximation ratio is obtainable with a constant-round QAOA for a few optimization problems from these classes. Using our proof framework, (v) we recover the Grover lower bound for unstructured search and, with small modification, show that our bound applies to any QAOA-style search protocol that starts in the ground state of the mixing unitaries.</description>

      <title>Low-Distortion Clustering in Bounded Growth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known clustering algorithm of Miller, Peng, and Xu (SPAA 2013) is useful for many applications, including low-diameter decomposition and low-energy distributed algorithms. One nice property of their clustering, shown in previous work by Chang, Dani, Hayes, and Pettie (PODC 2020), is that distances in the cluster graph are rescaled versions of distances in the original graph, up to an $O(\log n)$ distortion factor and rounding issues. Minimizing this distortion factor is important for efficiency in computing the clustering, as well as in further applications, once the clustering has been constructed.
  We prove that there exist graphs for which an $\Omega((\log n)^{1/3})$ distortion factor is necessary for any clustering. We also consider a class of nice graphs which we call uniformly bounded independence graphs. These include, for example, paths, lattice graphs, and "dense" unit disk graphs. For these graphs, we prove that clusterings of constant distortion always exist, and moreover, we give an efficient distributed algorithm to construct them. Our clustering algorithm is based on Voronoi cells centered at the vertices of a maximal independent set in a suitable power graph.
  Applications of our new clustering include low-energy simulation of distributed algorithms in the LOCAL, CONGEST, and RADIO-CONGEST models, as well as efficient approximate solutions to distributed combinatorial optimization problems. We complement these results with matching or nearly matching lower bounds.</description>
