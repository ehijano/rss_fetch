      <title>Empirical structure physicalism and realism, Hempel's dilemma, and an optimistic meta-induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a generalization of Hempel's dilemma, I introduce a novel notion of empirical structure, as well as theory supervenience as a new reductive relationship between theories. One theory supervenes on another theory if the empirical structure of the latter theory refines the empirical structure of the former theory. I then argue that (1) empirical structure physicalism, the thesis that the current special sciences supervene both on current and on future physics, avoids both horns of Hempel's dilemma; (2) in particular, mental theories remain empirically dispensable in the future; (3) empirical structure realism, the thesis that earlier theories of physics supervene on later theories of physics, is supported by an optimistic meta-induction; (4) this optimistic meta-induction can coexist with the well-known pessimistic meta-induction; (5) empirical structure physicalism is appropriately labeled as a type of physicalism; and (6) empirical structure physicalism is compatible with multiple realization. To illustrate the plausibility of empirical structure physicalism, I also briefly address the so-called knowledge argument.</description>

      <title>Relational Observables, Quiddities, and Structural Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, I argue that modern spacetime physics causes problems for a number of traditional accounts of modality, but also offers important new ideas about the connection between modal and non-modal features of reality. I suggest that recent work on relational observables in general relativity and quantum gravity can help us understand how non-modal features of reality could arise from modal features of reality within some form of modal ontic structural realism. In particular, I argue that the notion of an `internal view,' as employed in the partial/complete observables formalism and the quantum reference frame formalism, is an important conceptual insight which can help address outstanding problems in the philosophy of lawhood and modality.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Counterfactual communication not achieved yet -- A Comment on Salih et al. (2022)"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his Comment on our recent paper ``The laws of physics do not prohibit counterfactual communication'', \textit{npj Quantum Information} (2022) 8:60, Popescu argues that the claims of the paper are invalid. Here, we refute his argument, showing that it is based on ignoring the specifics of what we set out to prove (that counterfactual communication is possible \emph{for post-selected particles}, and more specifically in these cases is not prohibited by the weak trace or consistent histories criteria for particle path), followed by an unwarranted simplification of the protocol. Moreover, the Comment's excursion into interpretation is misplaced. Our communication protocol is a precisely defined one that allows two remote parties, albeit rarely, to communicate an arbitrarily long binary message, with arbitrarily high accuracy. This is not a matter of interpretation -- as the concrete example given in our paper in question illustrates. As for our overarching claim that no particles are exchanged in the course of this communication, we have already demonstrated this both theoretically and experimentally, in the postselected case we consider, as per the weak trace and consistent histories criteria for path of a quantum particle.</description>
