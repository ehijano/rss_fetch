      <title>Learning Hierarchical Interaction for Accurate Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, HimNet. Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing significantly to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.</description>

      <title>BEER: Biochemical Estimator and Explorer of Residues -- A Comprehensive Software Suite for Protein Sequence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein sequence analysis underpins research in biophysics, computational biology, and bioinformatics. We introduce BEER, a crossplatform graphical interface that accepts FASTA or Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, or manual sequence entry, and instantly computes a suite of physicochemical metrics, such as amino acid composition, Kyte Doolittle hydrophobicity profiles, net charge versus pH curves with automatic isoelectric point determination, solubility predictions, and key indices such as molecular weight, extinction coefficient, GRAVY (grand average of hydropathicity) score, instability index, and aromaticity. BEER's interactive visualizations, including bar and pie charts, hydropathy plots, residue level bead models, and radar diagrams make it easy to explore physicochemical properties of protein chains. A multichain module also enables direct comparison of complex assemblies. Built in Python with BioPython, PyQt5, and matplotlib, BEER delivers complete analyses of sequences up to 10000 residues in under one second.</description>
