      <title>The Role of Community Detection Methods in Performance Variations of Graph Mining Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, large graphs represent relationships among entities in complex systems. Mining these large graphs often containing millions of nodes and edges helps uncover structural patterns and meaningful insights. Dividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system analysis by revealing local information. Community detection extracts clusters or communities of graphs based on statistical methods and machine learning models using various optimization techniques. Structure based community detection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not rely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived from these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack ground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a universally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method that is consistently optimal across diverse applications. In many cases, it is unclear how practitioners select community detection methods, and choices are often made without explicitly considering their potential impact on downstream tasks. In this study, we investigate whether the choice of community detection algorithm significantly influences the performance of downstream applications. We propose a framework capable of integrating various community detection methods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes. Our comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms yield superior results in certain applications, highlighting that method selection substantially affects performance.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop Learning Through Decentralized Communication Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information sharing platforms like TripAdvisor and Waze involve human agents as both information producers and consumers. All these platforms operate in a centralized way to collect agents' latest observations of new options (e.g., restaurants, hotels, travel routes) and share such information with all in real time. However, after hearing the central platforms' live updates, many human agents are found selfish and unwilling to further explore unknown options for the benefit of others in the long run. To regulate the human-in-the-loop learning (HILL) game against selfish agents' free-riding, this paper proposes a paradigm shift from centralized to decentralized way of operation that forces agents' local explorations through restricting information sharing. When game theory meets distributed learning, we formulate our decentralized communication mechanism's design as a new multi-agent Markov decision process (MA-MDP), and derive its analytical condition to outperform today's centralized operation. As the optimal decentralized communication mechanism in MA-MDP is NP-hard to solve, we present an asymptotically optimal algorithm with linear complexity to determine the mechanism's timing of intermittent information sharing. Then we turn to non-myopic agents who may revert to even over-explore, and adapt our mechanism design to work. Simulation experiments using real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our decentralized mechanisms for various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>Generative Engine Optimization: How to Dominate AI Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2) dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent "big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the new generative search landscape.</description>

      <title>6G Resilience -- White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G must be designed to withstand, adapt to, and evolve amid prolonged, complex disruptions. Mobile networks' shift from efficiency-first to sustainability-aware has motivated this white paper to assert that resilience is a primary design goal, alongside sustainability and efficiency, encompassing technology, architecture, and economics. We promote resilience by analysing dependencies between mobile networks and other critical systems, such as energy, transport, and emergency services, and illustrate how cascading failures spread through infrastructures. We formalise resilience using the 3R framework: reliability, robustness, resilience. Subsequently, we translate this into measurable capabilities: graceful degradation, situational awareness, rapid reconfiguration, and learning-driven improvement and recovery.
  Architecturally, we promote edge-native and locality-aware designs, open interfaces, and programmability to enable islanded operations, fallback modes, and multi-layer diversity (radio, compute, energy, timing). Key enablers include AI-native control loops with verifiable behaviour, zero-trust security rooted in hardware and supply-chain integrity, and networking techniques that prioritise critical traffic, time-sensitive flows, and inter-domain coordination.
  Resilience also has a techno-economic aspect: open platforms and high-quality complementors generate ecosystem externalities that enhance resilience while opening new markets. We identify nine business-model groups and several patterns aligned with the 3R objectives, and we outline governance and standardisation. This white paper serves as an initial step and catalyst for 6G resilience. It aims to inspire researchers, professionals, government officials, and the public, providing them with the essential components to understand and shape the development of 6G resilience.</description>

      <title>Digital Iran Reloaded: Gamer Mitigation Tactics of IRI Information Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet censorship in the Islamic Republic of Iran restricts access to global platforms and services, forcing users to rely on circumvention technologies such as VPNs, proxies, and tunneling tools. This report presents findings from a mixed-methods study of 660 Iranian internet users, with a focus on gamers as a digitally literate and socially networked community. Survey data are combined with network measurements of latency and VPN performance to identify both technical and social strategies of circumvention. Results show that while younger users report higher confidence with circumvention, peer networks, rather than formal training, are the strongest predictors of resilience. Gaming communities, particularly those active on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, serve as hubs for sharing tactics and lowering barriers to adoption. These findings extend existing work on usable security and censorship circumvention by highlighting the intersection of infrastructural conditions and social learning. The study concludes with design and policy implications for developers, researchers, and funders working on digital rights and information controls.</description>

      <title>Personality-Enhanced Social Recommendations in SAMI: Exploring the Role of Personality Detection in Matchmaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations. To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full impact on student engagement and match quality.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximization in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximization in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilize rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>Free Elections in the Free State: Ensemble Analysis of Redistricting in New Hampshire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of legislative redistricting in New Hampshire, along with many other states across the country, was particularly contentious during the 2020 census cycle. In this paper we present an ensemble analysis of the enacted districts to provide mathematical context for claims made about these maps in litigation. Operationalizing the New Hampshire redistricting rules and algorithmically generating a large collection of districting plans allows us to construct a baseline for expected behavior of districting plans in the state and evaluate non-partisan justifications and geographic tradeoffs between districting criteria and partisan outcomes. In addition, our results demonstrate the impact of selection and aggregation of election data for analyzing partisan symmetry measures.</description>

      <title>UnsafeBench: Benchmarking Image Safety Classifiers on Real-World and AI-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of text-to-image models and concerns about their misuse, developers are increasingly relying on image safety classifiers to moderate their generated unsafe images. Yet, the performance of current image safety classifiers remains unknown for both real-world and AI-generated images. In this work, we propose UnsafeBench, a benchmarking framework that evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of image safety classifiers, with a particular focus on the impact of AI-generated images on their performance. First, we curate a large dataset of 10K real-world and AI-generated images that are annotated as safe or unsafe based on a set of 11 unsafe categories of images (sexual, violent, hateful, etc.). Then, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of five popular image safety classifiers, as well as three classifiers that are powered by general-purpose visual language models. Our assessment indicates that existing image safety classifiers are not comprehensive and effective enough to mitigate the multifaceted problem of unsafe images. Also, there exists a distribution shift between real-world and AI-generated images in image qualities, styles, and layouts, leading to degraded effectiveness and robustness. Motivated by these findings, we build a comprehensive image moderation tool called PerspectiveVision, which improves the effectiveness and robustness of existing classifiers, especially on AI-generated images. UnsafeBench and PerspectiveVision can aid the research community in better understanding the landscape of image safety classification in the era of generative AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Google Scholar is one of the top search engines to access research articles across multiple disciplines for scholarly literature. Google scholar advance search option gives the privilege to extract articles based on phrases, publishers name, authors name, time duration etc. In this work, we collected Google Scholar data (2000-2021) for two different research domains in computer science: Data Mining and Software Engineering. The scholar database resources are powerful for network analysis, data mining, and identify links between authors via authorship network. We examined coauthor-ship network for each domain and studied their network structure. Extensive experiments are performed to analyze publications trend and identifying influential authors and affiliated organizations for each domain. The network analysis shows that the networks features are distinct from one another and exhibit small communities within the influential authors of a particular domain.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Silence in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the classic multi-agent DeGroot model for opinion dynamics to incorporate the Spiral of Silence theory from political science. This theory states that individuals may withhold their opinions when they perceive them to be in the minority. As in the DeGroot model, a community of agents is represented as a weighted directed graph whose edges indicate how much agents influence one another. However, agents whose current opinions are in the minority become silent (i.e., they do not express their opinion). Two models for opinion update are then introduced. In the memoryless opinion model (SOM-), agents update their opinion by taking the weighted average of their non-silent neighbors' opinions. In the memory based opinion model (SOM+), agents update their opinions by taking the weighted average of the opinions of all their neighbors, but for silent neighbors, their most recent opinion is considered. We show that for SOM- convergence to consensus is guaranteed for clique graphs but, unlike for the classic DeGroot, not guaranteed for strongly-connected aperiodic graphs. In contrast, we show that for SOM+ convergence to consensus is not guaranteed even for clique graphs. We showcase our models through simulations offering experimental insights that align with key aspects of the Spiral of Silence theory. These findings reveal the impact of silence dynamics on opinion formation and highlight the limitations of consensus in more nuanced social models.</description>
