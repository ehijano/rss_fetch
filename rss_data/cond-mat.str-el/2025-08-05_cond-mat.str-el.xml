      <title>Nematic and partially polarized phases in rhombohedral graphene with varying number of layers: An extensive Hartree-Fock Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene systems with different number of layers feature an abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of the correlated phases for varying number of layers could be useful to interpret the experimental observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree-Fock calculations have been performed to build the phase diagram of rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene for different number of layers, in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can present nematicity, stabilized by electron-electron interactions, exhibiting rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping, and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin-orbit coupling proximity effects has been studied. Our results offer new insights into the role of correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems which will motivate future experimental and theoretical works.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary transition at the edge of a correlated topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with zig-zag edges and the Hubbard U-term tuned to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the two phases giving potential experimental signatures.</description>

      <title>Band mixing effects in one-dimensional charge transfer insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are governed by the electrons occupying strongly correlated $d$-orbitals that are hybridized with surrounding ligand oxygen $p$ orbitals to varying degrees. Their physics is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal (TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$, and on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a function of $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results spanning from the Mott insulating ($\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &gt; U$) to negative charge transfer regime $\Delta_\mathrm{CT} &lt; 0$ to better understand the ground and momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.</description>

      <title>Mixed spin states for robust ferromagnetism in strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration, distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Unified description of cuprate superconductors by fractionalized electrons emerging from integrated analyses of photoemission spectra and quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Transport in Single Quantum Dots: A Review from Linear Response to Nonlinear Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Resonant Fields Inducing Energy Towers in Lieb Quantum Spin Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg model on a Lieb lattice. A set of exact eigenstates is constructed based on the restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA) when a resonant staggered magnetic field is applied. These states are identical to the eigenstates of a system of two coupled angular momenta. Furthermore, we find that the RSGA can be applied to other eigenstates of the Lieb lattice in an approximate manner. Numerical simulations reveal that there exist sets of eigenstates, which obey a quasi-RSGA. These states act as energy towers within the low-lying excited spectrum, indicating that they are quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Quantum Path-integral Method for Fictitious Particle Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet theory and applications in open quantum and classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering (FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum systems, that is based on the Schr\"odinger equation. However, if we consider the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum, etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.</description>

      <title>From trigonal to triclinic: Symmetry-tuned Rashba effects in buckled honeycomb SrHfO$_{3}$-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb (SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R = 29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Ground State of Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$: The Crucial Role of Frustrated Zigzag Chains Revealed by Inelastic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on the magnetically frustrated $S=\frac12$ sawtooth-chain compound atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ featuring inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. Transverse to the sawtooth chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75 meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize atacamite's low-energy magnetism.</description>

      <title>A theory of strange metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a theory of strange metals that is based on the following asumptions: (i) wavelike coherence is lost at each hop between neighboring atoms in the solid, i.e. the metal is bad, (ii) the carriers move independently from one another and (iii) the motion of the charge carriers obeys the correspondence principle, i.e. the quantum-mechanically averaged carrier diffusion in time is the same as in the classical case. The theory explains $T$-linear resistivity with apparently Planckian scattering rates as well as both the stretched Drude and displaced Drude peaks that are commonly observed in optical absorption experiments. The present framework might also indicate a solution to the problem of universal dielectric relaxation in insulators.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ergodicity of Worldvolume HMC via embedding Generalized-thimble HMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times 6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).</description>

      <title>Classification of Average Crystalline Topological Superconductors through a Generalized Real-Space Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected by exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These phases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected topological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs -- topological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence. Unlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require exact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as the symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state ensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state construction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this generalized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases, and the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the constraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a physically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial symmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our classification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as an independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline topological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections, and they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected phases that have no analog in clean systems.</description>

      <title>Categorical Anomaly Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching 't Hooft anomalies is a powerful tool for constraining the low-energy dynamics of quantum systems and their allowed renormalization group (RG) flows. For non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, however, a key challenge has been the lack of a precise framework to characterize and quantify anomalies. We address this by identifying tensor functors between UV and IR symmetry categories as central to capturing these constraints. To this end, we introduce Anomalous Simple Categories (ASCies) as fundamental building blocks of categorical anomalies. A given symmetry category may support multiple ASCies, each encoding distinct anomalous features. These structures naturally arise in the context of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where tensor functors correspond to RG-interfaces between UV and IR SymTFTs, and ASCies are realized as particular such interfaces satisfying simple, universal criteria. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through examples involving anomalous 0-form, higher-form, and crucially, non-invertible symmetries in various spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal Neural Network Approach to Two-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems exhibit a rich array of physical phenomena, including non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional points, that remain largely inaccessible to existing numerical techniques. In this work, we investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Amplification in Nonequilibrium Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments on superconductors, a pump laser pulse often heats up the electronic system and suppresses the density of superfluid electrons. Subsequently, the electrons undergo a cooling process due to electron-phonon thermalization so that the superfluid density recovers in time. We show that if a supercurrent is initiated by a probe pulse in the cooling process, an intriguing phenomenon of 'supercurrent amplification' occurs, meaning that the net current grows in time with the increasing superfluid density. Using the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we uncover its microscopic origin as the momentum-relaxing scattering of quasi-particles by impurities and phonons, in stark contrast to the widely accepted intuition that impurities always attenuate currents. We further show that supercurrent amplification has important experimental manifestations, including the ultrafast Meissener effect and an optical reflectivity exceeding unity.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model in the canonical ensemble: a beyond mean-field approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without external trapping potentials.</description>

      <title>Topology in Holographic Mean-Field Theory at Zero and Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological invariants in strongly interacting many-body systems within holographic mean-field theory (H-MFT) framework. Analytic expressions for retarded Green's functions are obtained for all possible fermionic bilinear interactions in the limit of probe background limit $\mathrm{AdS}_4$, from which we construct topological Hamiltonians. Integrating Berry curvature over the momentum domain for the gapped spectra yields well-defined and quantized Chern numbers, enabling a systematic classification of them across interaction types. These topological invariants remain robust under deformation parameters like interaction and temperature, indicating that H-MFT encodes effective single-particle-state topology near a quantum critical point in strongly correlated systems. We point out why topological number is defined in the holographic theories while it is not in the perturbative field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous Keldysh functional integral for fermionic quantum field theories. We show convergence of a discrete-time Grassmann Gaussian integral representation in the time-continuum limit under very general hypotheses. We also prove analyticity of the effective action and explicit bounds for the truncated (connected) expectation values of the non-equilibrium system. These bounds imply clustering with a summable decay in the thermodynamic limit, provided these properties hold at time zero, and provided that the determinant bound and decay constant of the fermionic Keldysh covariance are bounded uniformly in the volume. We then give bounds for these constants and show that uniformity in the volume indeed holds for a general class of systems. Finally we show that in the setting of dissipative quantum systems, these bounds are not necessarily restricted to short times.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Orbital Inverse Faraday and Cotton-Mouton Effects in Hall Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall (QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH fluid.</description>

      <title>Topological phases and spontaneous symmetry breaking: the revenge of the original Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological properties in interacting one-dimensional models. We solve these models using bozonization and identify topologically non-trivial phases by counting the additional degeneracy (affiliated with the edge modes) of a finite-size system relative to the infinite one. We find even if the mean-field solution is topological, this may not be true when it arises from spontaneous symmetry breaking, including in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This implies that the original SSH model, as presented by Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger, is topologically trivial, as opposed to its mean-field version. A spinful version, on the other hand, does exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase. In that state, both mean-field solutions are topologically non-trivial and correspond to non-interacting SSH chains in the opposite phases with the winding number $\nu=1$. We show that this phase is protected by a chiral symmetry, similar to the non-interacting phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of topological phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher rank gauge theories are generalizations of electromagnetism where, in addition to overall charge conservation, there is also conservation of higher rank multipoles such as the total dipole moment. In this work we study a four dimensional lattice tensor gauge theory coupled to bosonic matter which has second rank tensor electric and magnetic fields and charge conservation on individual planes. Starting from the Hamiltonian, we derive the lattice action for the gauge fields coupled to $q=1,2$ charged scalars. We use the action formulation to carry out Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram as a function of the gauge ($\beta$) and matter ($\kappa$) couplings. We compute the nature of correlators at strong and weak coupling in the pure gauge theory and compare the results to numerical simulations. Simulations show that the naive weak coupling regime (small $\kappa$, large $\beta$) does not survive in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, the strong coupling confined phase, spans the whole phase diagram. It is a proliferation of instantons that destroys the weak coupling phase and we show, via a duality transformation, that the expected strong confinement is present in the analog of Wilson line correlators. For finite matter coupling at $q=1$ we find a single thermodynamic phase albeit with a first order phase transition terminating in a critical endpoint.For $q=2$ it is known that the the X-cube model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractonic topological order is recovered deep in the Higgs regime. The simulations indeed reveal a distinct Higgs phase in this case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Spin Chain with Ising Fusion Category Symmetry: A Perspective from Weak Hopf SymTFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a construction of a cluster state lattice Hamiltonian that exhibits the symmetry of the Ising fusion algebra. This construction is formulated within the framework of weak Hopf symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), where we assign smooth and rough boundaries to the weak Hopf quantum double model, thereby extending the conventional cluster state model. Central to our construction is the weak Hopf Ising boundary tube algebra $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}$, whose representation category is equivalent to the Ising fusion category $\mathsf{Ising}$. We take this algebra as the input data for the weak Hopf quantum double model. The resulting model exhibits Ising fusion symmetry on both open and closed $1\text{d}$ manifolds. On open manifolds, the symmetry is governed by $\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}} \otimes \mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee}$; on closed manifolds, it reduces to $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}) \otimes \operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$. Since the Ising fusion algebra embeds into $\operatorname{Cocom}(\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{Ising}}^{\vee})$, the model faithfully realizes the symmetry of the Ising fusion category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are special classes of quantum field theories that find applications ranging from critical phenomena to theories of quantum gravity via holography. Understanding thermal effects in CFTs is crucial: criticality is experimentally probed at finite temperature, and, from the holographic perspective, the study of thermal CFTs is dual to the study of black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this thesis, we explore the kinematics and dynamics of finite-temperature CFTs by analyzing broken and unbroken symmetries and adapting various analytical and numerical bootstrap approaches to finite-temperature correlation functions. These methods are non-perturbatively valid and can be tested against exactly solvable models, such as free theories and two-dimensional systems, as well as compared with perturbative calculations. The main applications discussed in this thesis concern one- and two-point functions and the free energy density in the O(N) models in three dimensions, with particular focus on the 3d Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (N = 1,2,3).</description>

      <title>Simulating high-temperature superconductivity in moir\'e WSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moir\'e WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform for tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moir\'e WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moir\'e unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1, superconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc occurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective Fermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices that can be used to study high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Itinerant Magnetic Domain Wall and Quasiparticle Boundary State in Spin-Density-Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are characterized by reorientation of local spins. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic domain wall structure of the spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we found the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation. This generates a double-Q SDW state, which is further evidenced by an accompanying second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. Interestingly, the screw dislocations induced half vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. The spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls. Remarkably, for the first time we observed the SDW quasiparticle states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new type of domain wall distinct to that of local moment magnetism, with a mechanism rooted in the itinerant nature of SDW.</description>

      <title>Destabilisation of local magnetic anisotropy in heavy-fermion compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local magnetic anisotropy of a typical crystalline compound is usually attributed to the combined effect of crystal electric fields and spin-orbit coupling. We show that this simple local picture is transformed in heavy-fermion compounds by the development of coherent electron scattering from local spin degrees of freedom. Provided the dominance of the coherence energy scale over the magnetic energy scale is strong enough, the fractionalisation and delocalisation of the spins destabilises their single-ion anisotropy by generating an opposing anisotropy in the exchange. Experimentally, this can manifest as competing splittings in the Curie-Weiss constants and effective moments. We show that in the presence of orthorhombic or tetragonal symmetry the destabilisation of the anisotropy can result in either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order that is perpendicular to the high-temperature easy axis. In the absence of destabilisation, we show that the order is more likely to be antiferromagnetic. In agreement with our theory, we also observe that the temperature at which the anisotropy of the uniform magnetic response changes tracks the coherence energy scale in a wide range of actinide and lanthanide compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the quantum pseudospin-1 pyrochlore magnet featuring Fe$^{2+}$-based spinel oxides that addresses the formation of amplitude-modulated spin-density waves. We propose that the relatively small spin-orbit coupling and the small extra crystal field splitting in these materials create anisotropic exchange interactions and strong single-ion anisotropy, respectively, whose interplay becomes the source of quadrupolar moments selectively appearing on certain sublattices, leading to a spatially modulated hybrid of dipolar and quadrupolar moments. This mechanism represents the possibility of insulating magnets to form an exotic phase with coexisting liquid-solid properties.</description>

      <title>Flat bands on spherical surface: from Landau levels to giant-quantum-number orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands result in a divergent density of states and high sensitivity to interactions in physical systems. While such bands are well known in systems under magnetic fields, their realization and behavior in zero-field settings remain largely unexplored. Here we compare the behavior of electrons confined to a single flat band on the surface of a sphere to those in flat bands under a magnetic field. The zero-field flat band exhibits an additional C(2) symmetry, which causes electrons to symmetrically cluster on opposite sides of the sphere's center when a trapping potential is introduced, resulting in a unique form of long-range "entanglement". To explore these findings experimentally, we propose a feasible setup to explore the unique properties of zero-field flat bands on spherical substrates, offering a promising route for studying interaction-driven states in spherical geometry without external fields.</description>

Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions between Symmetry-Enriched Fracton Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically ordered phases exhibit further complexity in the presence of global symmetries: Their anyonic excitations may exhibit different transformation patterns under these symmetries, leading to a classification in terms of symmetry-enriched topological orders. We develop a generic scheme to study an analogous situation for three-dimensional fracton phases by means of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) with finite bond dimension, which allow us to tune phase transitions between different symmetry fractionalization patterns. We focus on the X-Cube model, a paradigmatic fracton model hosting two types of excitations: lineons, which are mobile in a single direction only, and fractons that are immobile on their own. By deforming the local tensors of the fixed point ground state, we find a family of exact wavefunctions for which the symmetry fractionalization under an anti-unitary symmetry on both types of excitations is directly visible. These wavefunctions are non-stabilizer states and have non-vanishing correlation lengths. They even exhibit power-law correlations at criticality between two symmetry-enriched topological orders. Furthermore, the isoTNS description allows for the explicit construction of a linear-depth quantum circuit to sequentially realize these exotic 3D states on a quantum processor, including a holographic scheme using only a pair of two-dimensional qubit arrays alongside measurements. Our approach provides a construction to enrich phases with exotic topological or fracton order and to study 3D quantum phase transition with exact wavefunctions, and offers a tractable route to implement and characterize fracton order on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function, considering both the case of suppressed magnetization ($m = 0$) and finite magnetization ($m \neq 0$). When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits a clear $60^\circ$ periodicity in its angular dependence, with the locations of maxima and minima consistent with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. A qualitative difference in their temperature dependence is observed: the minima show gap-like behavior that may signal Majorana gap formation due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, while the maxima do not exhibit the expected gapless Majorana fermion signature. In addition, a linear-in-field effect -- distinct from magnetization -- emerges, with the characteristic temperature below which angular dependence appears increasing linearly with the magnetic field. Importantly, this directional dependence becomes quantitatively significant only at very low temperatures. When finite magnetization is included, the angular dependence of the specific heat remains, and the qualitative behavior is similar to the $m = 0$ case: the minima continue to exhibit gap-like features, while the maxima do not show signatures of gapless Majorana fermions. These results suggest that suppressing magnetization alone is insufficient to realize quantum spin liquid behavior in the Kitaev model under a magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. Our framework produces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that generate gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying gapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$, $\hat{\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for generating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.</description>

      <title>Bath parameterization in multi-band cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable algorithms to solve complex impurity problems are instrumental to a routine use of quantum embedding methods for material discovery. In this context, we employ an efficient selected configuration interaction impurity solver to investigate the role of bath discretization, specifically, bath size and parameterization, in Hamiltonian-based cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for the one- and two-orbital Hubbard models. We consider two- and four-site clusters for the single-orbital model and a two-site cluster for the two-orbital model. Our results demonstrate that, for small bath sizes, the choice of parameterization can significantly influence the solution, highlighting the importance of systematic convergence checks. Comparing different bath parameterizations not only reveals the robustness of a given solution but can also provide insights into the nature of different solutions and potential instabilities of the paramagnetic state. We present an extensive analysis of the zero-temperature Mott transition of the paramagnetic half-filled single-band Hubbard model, benchmarking our findings against previous literature. We find that for the single-band model the dependence on parameterization is weak for the largest bath sizes accessible with ASCI, while a tendency towards a nematic solution can be seen when the bath size is small. Building on this, we extend our study to the multi-band regime, where we present the first systematic analysis at zero temperature for two orbitals and a two-site cluster. This setup allows us to assess the effect of nearest-neighbor dynamical correlations on the multi-orbital Mott transition. In this case, some quantitative dependence on the parameterization is retained for the two-orbital model, for instance in the value of the critical interaction for a Mott transition.</description>

Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials are a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr- and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have explored the Metallic-Flux Nanonucleation method to synthesize single crystals and nanowires (diameter $\approx$ 170 nm) of CeIn$_{3}$ and compare their properties. The effects of reduced dimensionality were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results. We attribute these findings to an increasing magnetic order frustration induced by dimensionality in CeIn$_{3}$ nanowires.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have great potential in solving the ground state of various many-body problems. However, several key challenges remain to be overcome before NNs can tackle problems and system sizes inaccessible with more established tools. Here, we present a general and efficient method for learning the NN representation of an arbitrary many-body complex wave function from its $N$-particle probability density and probability current density. Having reached overlaps as large as $99.9\%$, we employ our neural wave function for pre-training to effortlessly solve the fractional quantum Hall problem with Coulomb interactions and realistic Landau-level mixing for as many as $25$ particles. Our work demonstrates efficient, accurate simulation of highly-entangled quantum matter using general-purpose deep NNs enhanced with physics-informed initialization.</description>

Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.</description>

      <title>Compatible Instability: Gauge Constraints of Elasticity Inherited by Electronic Nematic Criticality</title>

Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital, or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity, by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However, being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of domain formation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations. As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Bosonized Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas via Friedrichs Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Benedikter and the author proved an approximate formula for the momentum distribution of a 3d fermionic gas interacting by a short-range pair potential in the mean-field regime, within a trial state close to the ground state. Here, we derive an exact formula for the momentum distribution in this trial state, using a diagrammatic formalism due to Friedrichs. We further demonstrate how the formula of Benedikter and the author arises from a restriction of the contributing diagrams to those corresponding to a bosonization approximation.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of information scrambling in bosonic systems undergoing Gaussian unitary evolution associated with quadratic Hamiltonians. For initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks under Gaussian random local dynamics. In addition, we show that randomness in the Hamiltonian causes the tripartite mutual information to saturate at relatively large negative values. Therefore, despite being integrable, these systems exhibit information-scrambling diagnostics that mirror those observed in chaotic systems. We note, however, that random quadratic Hamiltonians can have a component exhibiting Wigner-Dyson energy-level statistics; for non-Gaussian states within the corresponding subspace, these systems can display chaotic behavior. Our results provide insight into the Gaussian dynamics of continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Topological Hall Effects with Phase-Space Berry Curvatures: Electric, Thermal, and Thermoelectric Transport in Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the electrical and thermal transverse linear response functions such as the Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall effects in magnetic materials that harbor topological spin textures like skyrmions. In addition to the ordinary transverse response that arises from the Lorentz force due to the external magnetic field, there is an anomalous and a topological response. The intrinsic anomalous response derives from the momentum space Berry curvature arising from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a system with a nonzero magnetization, while the topological response arises from real space Berry curvature related to the the topological charge density of the spin texture. To take into account all these effects on an equal footing, we develop a semiclassical theory that incorporates all phase-space Berry curvatures. We show within a controlled, semiclassical approach that all conductivities -- electrical, thermoelectric, and thermal Hall -- can be written as the sum of three contributions: ordinary, anomalous and topological, when the conduction electron SOC is weaker than the exchange coupling to the spin texture. All other contributions, including those arising from mixed real-momentum space Berry curvature, are negligible in the regime where our calculations are controlled. We derive various general relations that remain valid at low temperatures including the Weidemann-Franz relation between the electrical and thermal conductivities and the Mott relation between the thermoelectric and electrical conductivities. We also discuss how an in-plane Hall response arises in three-dimensional materials with sufficiently low symmetry. Finally, the Hall response is qualitatively different when the conduction electron SOC is stronger than the exchange coupling to the spin texture, where we find that the anomalous term dominates and the topological term vanishes.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <title>Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds: a mathematical perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology phenomena in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \leq 3$, vanishing Chern classes of bundles of Bloch eigenfunctions characterize operators with exponentially localized Wannier functions (these functions form convenient bases of spectrally determined subspaces of $L^2$). However, for systems with additional symmetries, such as the $C_{2}T$ (space-time reversal) or the $PT$ (parity-time) symmetry, a set of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with such symmetry may not exist. We show that for rank 2 Bloch bundles with such symmetry, non-trivial Euler classes are obstructions to constructing exponentially localized compatible Wannier functions. We also show that this obstruction can be lifted by adding additional Bloch bundles with the symmetry, even though the Stiefel--Whitney class of the total bundle is non-trivial. This allows a construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions compatible with the symmetry and that is referred to as topological fragility.</description>

      <title>Gate-voltage-driven quantum phase transition at $0.7 (2e^2/h)$ in quantum point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum phase transition (QPT) in quantum point contacts by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent quasiparticle energy at the Fermi level at zero temperature. This energy is computed using the local density of states at the site of the localized spin, which is extracted from the replicated gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance shaped by entangled-state tunneling. The QPT occurs between symmetric ($G \geq 0.7 G_0$) and asymmetric ($G &lt; 0.7 G_0$) Kondo coupling states, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, and is driven by the migration of a localized spin in response to the side-gate voltage. The asymmetric state exhibits two distinct Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The existence of two Kondo temperatures in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ regime accounts for both the anomalous gate-voltage dependence of the zero-bias anomaly width and the inability to define a Kondo temperature in the $G &lt; 0.7 G_0$ region.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Josephson coupling of d-vectors in triplet superconductors arising from frustrated spin textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that coupling itinerant electrons to a noncollinear classical exchange field can induce anisotropic Josephson coupling between superconducting $d$-vectors, analogous to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism. Using perturbative methods, we analyze an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice. Noncollinear local spin textures generate spin triplet pairing correlations and can favor spatially varying superconducting order due to anisotropic Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors, endowing a ``pliability'' to the pairing order that competes with the superfluid stiffness. For nonunitary pairing, this spatial texture of $d$-vectors can give rise to anomalous vortices in the absence of an external magnetic field. We further predict a Josephson diode effect with efficiency proportional to the spin chirality of the underlying magnetic texture. These results establish a link between frustrated magnetism and spatial textures of triplet superconducting pairing, with implications for a range of materials such as Mn$_3$Ge and $4$Hb-TaS$_2$, where superconductivity can be proximity-induced or intrinsic.</description>
