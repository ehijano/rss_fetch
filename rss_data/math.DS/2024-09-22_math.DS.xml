      <title>Discrete-Time Dynamical Systems Generated by a Quadratic Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a specific class of quadratic operators. For these operators, we identified all fixed points and categorized their types in the general case. Our analysis revealed that there are no attractive fixed points except the origin. Additionally, we investigated the global dynamics in the two-dimensional case and generalized several results obtained for lower-dimensional scenarios</description>

      <title>Limits of Learning Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamical system is a transformation of a phase space, and the transformation law is the primary means of defining as well as identifying the dynamical system. It is the object of focus of many learning techniques. Yet there are many secondary aspects of dynamical systems - invariant sets, the Koopman operator, and Markov approximations, which provide alternative objectives for learning techniques. Crucially, while many learning methods are focused on the transformation law, we find that forecast performance can depend on how well these other aspects of the dynamics are approximated. These different facets of a dynamical system correspond to objects in completely different spaces - namely interpolation spaces, compact Hausdorff sets, unitary operators and Markov operators respectively. Thus learning techniques targeting any of these four facets perform different kinds of approximations. We examine whether an approximation of any one of these aspects of the dynamics could lead to an approximation of another facet. Many connections and obstructions are brought to light in this analysis. Special focus is put on methods of learning of the primary feature - the dynamics law itself. The main question considered is the connection of learning this law with reconstructing the Koopman operator and the invariant set. The answers are tied to the ergodic and topological properties of the dynamics, and reveal how these properties determine the limits of forecasting techniques.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian control to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although it is necessary for the functioning of many systems, too much synchronization can also be detrimental, e.g., (partially) synchronized brain patterns support high-level cognitive processes and bodily control, but hypersynchronization can lead to epileptic seizures and tremors, as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
  Consequently, a critical research question is how to develop effective pinning control methods capable to reduce or modulate synchronization as needed.
  Although such methods exist to control pairwise-coupled oscillators, there are none for higher-order interactions, despite the increasing evidence of their relevant role in brain dynamics.
  In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a generalized control method designed to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators connected through higher-order interactions. Our method embeds a higher-order Kuramoto model into a suitable Hamiltonian flow, and builds up on previous work in Hamiltonian control theory to analytically construct a feedback control mechanism.
  We numerically show that the proposed method effectively prevents synchronization. Although our findings indicate that pairwise contributions in the feedback loop are often sufficient, the higher-order generalization becomes crucial when pairwise coupling is weak. Finally, we explore the minimum number of controlled nodes required to fully desynchronize oscillators coupled via an all-to-all hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: On the analytic side, we prove the quantum ergodicity (QE) of Hamiltonian operators on certain series of unitary flat bundles, using mixed quantization techniques. On the dynamical side, we introduce a new family of partially hyperbolic flow associated with QE and establish its ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Statistical Solutions of the Incompressible Euler Equations and Landau-Lifshitz Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rigorously the infinite Reynolds limit of the solutions of the Landau-Lifschitz equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for an incompressible fluid on a $d$-dimensional torus for $d\geq 2.$ These equations, which model the effects of thermal fluctuations in fluids, are given a standard physical interpretation as a low-wavenumber ``effective field theory'', rather than as stochastic partial differential equations. We study in particular solutions which enjoy some a priori Besov regularity in space, as expected for initial data chosen from a driven, turbulent steady-state ensemble. The empirical basis for this regularity hypothesis, uniform in Reynolds number, is carefully discussed, including evidence from numerical simulations of turbulent flows that incorporate thermal fluctuations. Considering the initial-value problem for the Landau-Lifschitz equations, our main result is that the infinite Reynolds number limit is a space-time statistical solution of the incompressible Euler equations in the sense of Vishik \&amp; Fursikov. Such solutions are described by a probability measure on space-time velocity fields whose realizations are weak or distributional solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, each with the same prescribed initial data. In conjunction with recent numerical evidence that these probability measures are non-trivial, our theorem shows that the mathematical non-uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for Euler, as revealed by convex integration studies, may be physically realized. In support of the theory of spontaneous stochasticity, any persistent randomness in the infinite-Reynolds limit is associated to a nontrivial probability distribution over non-unique solutions of the ideal Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a kinetic model describing social interactions on a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the optimal control of a kinetic model describing agents who migrate on a graph and interact within its nodes exchanging a physical quantity. As a prototype model, we consider the spread of an infectious disease on a graph, so that the exchanged quantity is the viral-load. The control, exerted on both the mobility and on the interactions separately, aims at minimising the average macroscopic viral-load.
  We prove that minimising the average viral-load weighted by the mass in each node is the most effective and convenient strategy. We consider two different interactions: in the first one the infection (gain) and the healing (loss) processes happen within the same interaction, while in the second case the infection and healing result from two different processes. With the appropriate controls, we prove that in the first case it is possible to stop the increase of the disease, but paying a very high cost in terms of control, while in the second case it is possible to eradicate the disease. We test numerically the role of each intervention and the interplay between the mobility and the interaction control strategies in each model.</description>

      <title>Neural filtering for Neural Network-based Models of Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of neural networks in modeling dynamic systems has become prominent due to their ability to estimate complex nonlinear functions. Despite their effectiveness, neural networks face challenges in long-term predictions, where the prediction error diverges over time, thus degrading their accuracy. This paper presents a neural filter to enhance the accuracy of long-term state predictions of neural network-based models of dynamic systems. Motivated by the extended Kalman filter, the neural filter combines the neural network state predictions with the measurements from the physical system to improve the estimated state's accuracy. The neural filter's improvements in prediction accuracy are demonstrated through applications to four nonlinear dynamical systems. Numerical experiments show that the neural filter significantly improves prediction accuracy and bounds the state estimate covariance, outperforming the neural network predictions.</description>

      <title>H\"older curves with exotic tangent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important implication of Rademacher's Differentiation Theorem is that every Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$ infinitesimally looks like a line at almost all of its points in the sense that at $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost every point of $\Gamma$, the only weak tangent to $\Gamma$ is a straight line through the origin. In this article, we show that, in contrast, the infinitesimal structure of H\"older curves can be much more extreme. First we show that for every $s&gt;1$ there exists a $(1/s)$-H\"older curve $\Gamma_s$ in a Euclidean space with $\mathcal{H}^s(\Gamma_s)&gt;0$ such that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many topologically distinct weak tangents. Second, we study the weak tangents of self-similar connected sets (which are canonical examples of H\"older curves) and prove that infinitely many of the curves $\Gamma_s$ have the additional property that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits a weak tangent to $\Gamma_s$ which is not admitted as (not even bi-Lipschitz to) a weak tangent to any planar self-similar set at typical points.</description>

      <title>Melnikov's persistence for completely degenerate Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Melnikov's persistence for completely degenerate Hamiltonian systems with the following Hamiltonian \begin{equation*} H(x,y,u,v)=h(y)+g(u,v)+\varepsilon P(x,y,u,v),~~~(x,y,u,v)\in \mathbb{T}^n\times{G}\times \mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^d, \end{equation*} where $n\geq2$ and $d\geq1$ are positive integers, $G\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $g=o(|u|^2+|v|^2)$ admits complete degeneracy and certain transversality, and $\varepsilon P$ is the small perturbation. This is a try in studying lower-dimensional invariant tori in the normal complete degeneracy. Under R\"{u}ssmann-like non-degenerate condition and transversality condition, we apply the homotopy invariance of topological degree to remove the first order terms about $u$ and $v$ and employ the quasi-linear KAM iterative procedure to derive the persistence of lower-dimensional invariant tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study Poissonian actions of Polish groups as a framework to Poisson suspensions, characterize them spectrally, and provide a complete characterization of their ergodicity. We further construct 'spatial' Poissonian actions, answering partially a question of Glasner, Tsirelson &amp; Weiss about L\'evy groups. We also construct for every diffeomorphism group an ergodic free spatial probability preserving actions. This constitutes a new class of Polish groups admitting non-essentially countable orbit equivalence relations, obtaining progress on a problem of Kechris.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth Morse-Smale vector field with Lyapunov constraints (Lyapunov function) one shows how and why the non-triviality of the cohomology, as concluded from its additive structure, detects rest points and the multiplicative structure of the cohomology detects instantons (trajectories between rest points). The same remains true for Lyapunov closed one form, a more general Lyapunov constraint, but in this presentation this fact is discussed only informally. These observations are based on the smooth " manifold with corner structures" of the stable/unstable sets and of the set of trajectories of such vector fields.

Abstract: We show that for every ergodic and aperiodic probability preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},m,T)$, there exists $f:X\to \mathbb{Z}^d$, whose corresponding cocycle satisfies the $d$-dimensional local central limit theorem.
  We use the $2$-dimensional result to resolve a question of Huang, Shao and Ye and Franzikinakis and Host regarding non-convergence in $L^2$ of polynomial multiple averages of non-commuting zero entropy transformations. Our methods also give the first examples of failure of multiple recurrence for zero entropy transformations along polynomial iterates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics of multiple scalar/pseudoscalar fields are difficult to solve, especially when the field-space metric is curved. This presents a challenge in determining whether a given model can support cosmic acceleration, without solving for the on-shell solution. In this work, we present bounds on late-time FLRW-cosmologies in classes of theories that involve arbitrary numbers of scalar and pseudoscalar fields coupled both kinetically (leading to a curved field space metric) and through scalar potentials. Such bounds are proven analytically, independently of initial conditions, with no approximation in the field equations and without referring to explicit solutions. Besides their broad applications to cosmological model building, our bounds can be applied to studying asymptotic cosmologies of certain classes of string compactifications.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a new scheme for studying the dynamics of a quintic wave equation with nonlocal weak damping in a 3D smooth bounded domain. As an application, the existence and structure of weak, strong, and exponential attractors for the solution semigroup of this equation are obtained. The investigation sheds light on the well-posedness and long-time behavior of nonlinear dissipative evolution equations with nonlinear damping and critical nonlinearity.</description>
