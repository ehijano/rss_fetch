      <title>Gas-cell development for nuclear astrophysics motivated studies on noble gas targets and the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical nuclear physics experiments in most cases the target is solid, either in atomic or in molecular form. However, there are selected cases, where solid target is hardly be produced. Such a case is in particular, when the target is noble gas. In many astrophysical scenarios, such as big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), stellar hydrogen burning, and supernova explosions, alpha induced reactions on noble gas nuclei play a crucial role. Studying these reactions in the laboratory requires these noble gas atoms to be confined in a sufficient amount to allow the reactions. For example, in case of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction, both reactants are noble gases. The reaction cross section was experimentally determined in several works, however there are still energy regions lacking experimental data, rendering the extrapolations towards the astrophysically relevant energies uncertain. To be able to study among others the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction, a thin-windowed gas-cell target was developed, which can be used to study alpha induced reactions on noble gases leading to radioactive isotopes. The reaction product is collected inside a catcher foil to be analyzed later with gamma spectroscopy. Using the described gas-cell, new experimental total cross section of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction was determined in the energy range of $E_\mathrm{c.m.} = 2600-3000$~keV. These results confirm the overall trend, and also the absolute scale in this energy range. In addition, studying particle scattering with the same reactant as a radiative capture gives valuable information about the compound nucleus. The measured scattering cross section can be used forvalidations of theoretical reaction cross section estimates. For this aim, gas-cell was designed to study alpha scattering on noble gas target. A few test measurement is presented with the scattering gas-cell.</description>

      <title>Software Defined Radio for on-line interaction with beam processes in the heavy ion storage ring ESR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of software defined radio in on-line interaction with the beam processes of the heavy ion storage ring is presented. It is discussed how this new technique can enhance the beam time efficiency and open up new measurement possibilities. Discussed is a specific example to halt the accelerator running in case a rare stored particle is identified online.</description>

      <title>The glue that binds us all -- Latin America and the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider, a next generation electron-hadron and electron-nuclei scattering facility, will be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The wealth of new data will shape research in hadron physics, from nonperturbative QCD techniques to perturbative QCD improvements and global QCD analyses, for the decades to come. With the present proposal, Latin America based physicists, whose expertise lies on the theory and phenomenology side, make the case for the past and future efforts of a growing community, working hand-in-hand towards developing theoretical tools and predictions to analyze, interpret and optimize the results that will be obtained at the EIC, unveiling the role of the glue that binds us all. This effort is along the lines of various initiatives taken in the U.S., and supported by colleagues worldwide, such as the ones by the EIC User Group which were highlighted during the Snowmass Process and the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5).</description>

      <title>Exploring Isospin Symmetry Breaking in Exotic Nuclei: High-Precision Mass Measurement of 23Si and Shell-Model Calculations of T = 5/2 Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a high-precision mass measurement of the proton-rich nucleus 23Si, performed with the LEBIT Penning trap at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) utilizing the time-of-flight ion cyclotron resonance (TOF-ICR) technique. We determined a mass excess of 23362.9(5.8) keV, which agrees with a recent storage-ring measurement from CSRe but has a factor 20 improved precision. 23Si is hence the nucleus with the most precisely known mass of all nuclei with an isospin projection of Tz =-5/2. We performed shell-model calculations with the USDC and USDCm Hamiltonians to study binding energy differences and Thomas-Ehrmann shifts in mirror systems with an isospin up to T = 5/2. Our experimental result and other recently reported masses of neutron-deficient sd-shell nuclei agree well with the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that isospin symmetry breaking in sd-shell nuclei, even at high isospin values, is well described by modern shell-model calculations.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and nonzero baryon chemical potential. In this article, we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of hardon resonance gas models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>
