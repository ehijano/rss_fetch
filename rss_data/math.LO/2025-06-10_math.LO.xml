      <title>A Strongly Non-Saturated Aronszajn Tree Without Weak Kurepa Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$, there exists a forcing poset which is Y-proper and $\kappa$-c.c., collapses $\kappa$ to become $\omega_2$, and adds an Aronszajn tree together with a family of $\omega_2$-many strongly almost disjoint subtrees of it. The quotients of this forcing in intermediate extensions are indestructibly Y-proper on a stationary set with respect to any Y-proper forcing extension. As a consequence of this forcing, we prove from an inaccessible cardinal that the existence of a strongly non-saturated Aronszajn tree is consistent with the non-existence of a weak Kurepa tree. This result solves an open problem due to Martinez Mendoza and the author, and provides another solution to a problem of Moore in the context of the negation of the continuum hypothesis. Finally, we prove from a supercompact cardinal that the existence of a strongly non-saturated Aronszajn tree is consistent with two-cardinal tree properties such as the indestructible guessing model principle.</description>

      <title>On the methods of reduction of some types of Marczerwski-Burstin measurable functions to continuous functions on products of perfect sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide product-wise generalizations of certain Marczewski-Burstin bases such as sets with (s)-property and completely Ramsey sets. For each of those we prove - as an analog of classical Luzin's and Eggleston's theorems that functions measurable with respect to those families can be reduced to continuous functions on a product of perfect sets. Moreover we also provide a way to reduce sequences of such functions to continuity, providing generalizations to Laver's extension of Halpern-Lauchli and Harrington theorems.</description>

      <title>CNFs and DNFs with Exactly $k$ Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model counting is a fundamental problem that consists of determining the number of satisfying assignments for a given Boolean formula. The weighted variant, which computes the weighted sum of satisfying assignments, has extensive applications in probabilistic reasoning, network reliability, statistical physics, and formal verification. A common approach for solving weighted model counting is to reduce it to unweighted model counting, which raises an important question: {\em What is the minimum number of terms (or clauses) required to construct a DNF (or CNF) formula with exactly $k$ satisfying assignments?}
  In this paper, we establish both upper and lower bounds on this question. We prove that for any natural number $k$, one can construct a monotone DNF formula with exactly $k$ satisfying assignments using at most $O(\sqrt{\log k}\log\log k)$ terms. This construction represents the first $o(\log k)$ upper bound for this problem. We complement this result by showing that there exist infinitely many values of $k$ for which any DNF or CNF representation requires at least $\Omega(\log\log k)$ terms or clauses. These results have significant implications for the efficiency of model counting algorithms based on formula transformations.</description>

      <title>Likely intersections in powers of the multiplicative group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive two finiteness properties as consequences of the geometrical non-degeneracy of an algebraic subvariety $W$ of a power of the multiplicative group, concerning the intersections of $W$ with translates of a subtorus $H$ of dimension greater than or equal to the codimension of $W$. The first one is that every translate of $H$ intersects $W$, unless $H$ is contained in one of finitely many proper subtori depending only on $W$. The second one is that every translate of $H$ by a torsion point intersects $W$, unless the translate is contained in one of finitely many proper algebraic subgroups, again depending only on $W$. We use methods from tropical geometry and equidistribution, as well as some very mild model theory.</description>

      <title>The consistency strength of determinacy when all sets are universally Baire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.04244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the large cardinal strength of the Axiom of Determinacy when enhanced with the hypothesis that all sets of reals are universally Baire is much stronger than the Axiom of Determinacy itself. Sargsyan conjectured it to be as strong as the existence of a cardinal that is both a limit of Woodin cardinals and a limit of strong cardinals. Larson, Sargsyan and Wilson used a generalization of Woodin's derived model construction to show that this conjectured result would be optimal. In this paper we introduce a new translation procedure for hybrid mice extending work of Steel, Zhu and Sargsyan and apply it to prove Sargsyan's conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Countable, Dense, Dedekind-Complete Subset of $\mathbb{R}$ Constructed by Extending $\mathbb{Q}$ via Simultaneous Marking of Closed Intervals with Rational Endpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores the model-dependent nature of set cardinality, emphasizing that cardinality is not absolute but varies across different axiomatic frameworks. Although Cantor's diagonal argument shows the real numbers are non-denumerable within ZF (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), the precise cardinality of the continuum remains unsettled and depends critically on model assumptions. For instance, under G\"odel's inner-model axiom V=Ultimate L, the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) holds, whereas Martin's Axiom implies its negation. The L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem further illustrates this relativity by demonstrating that any first-order theory admitting a non-denumerable model must also admit denumerable models, highlighting that even the notions of "denumerable" and "non-denumerable" are inherently model-relative.
  To examine these issues concretely, we construct two countable sets with properties typically attributed only to the continuum. First, within ZFC (ZF plus Axiom of Choice), we build a countable set $S_m$ from all closed intervals with rational endpoints. By assigning irrational marks simultaneously to each interval, respecting the nested interval structure, we obtain a set that is everywhere dense and Dedekind complete, yet countable. Next, we explicitly construct a similar set within Wang's $\Sigma$-model by systematically inserting irrational numbers between rational numbers via infinite diagonalization, resulting in a constructive enumeration of reals.
  These findings identify foundational tensions between classical proofs of non-denumerability and the Nested Interval Property, prompting a reevaluation of cardinality and CH within formal set theory.</description>

      <title>Specialization of Difference Equations and High Frobenius Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study valued fields equipped with an automorphism $\sigma$ which is locally infinitely contracting in the sense that $\alpha\ll\sigma\alpha$ for all $0&lt;\alpha\in\Gamma$. We show that various notions of valuation theory, such as Henselian and strictly Henselian hulls, admit meaningful transformal analogues. We prove canonical amalgamation results, and exhibit the way that transformal wild ramification is controlled by torsors over generalized vector groups. Model theoretically, we determine the model companion: it is decidable, admits a simple axiomatization, and enjoys elimination of quantifiers up to algebraically bounded quantifiers.
  The model companion is shown to agree with the limit theory of the Frobenius action on an algebraically closed and nontrivially valued field. This opens the way to a motivic intersection theory for difference varieties that was previously available only in characteristic zero. As a first consequence, the class of algebraically closed valued fields equipped with a distinguished Frobenius $x\mapsto x^{q}$ is decidable, uniformly in $q$.</description>

      <title>A note on surjective cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For cardinals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, we write $\mathfrak{a}=^\ast\mathfrak{b}$ if there are sets $A$ and $B$ of cardinalities $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, respectively, such that there are partial surjections from $A$ onto $B$ and from $B$ onto $A$. $=^\ast$-equivalence classes are called surjective cardinals. In this article, we show that $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}_\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is a fixed aleph, cannot prove that surjective cardinals form a cardinal algebra, which gives a negative solution to a question proposed by Truss [J. Truss, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 27, 165--207 (1984)]. Nevertheless, we show that surjective cardinals form a ``surjective cardinal algebra'', whose postulates are almost the same as those of a cardinal algebra, except that the refinement postulate is replaced by the finite refinement postulate. This yields a smoother proof of the cancellation law for surjective cardinals, which states that $m\cdot\mathfrak{a}=^\ast m\cdot\mathfrak{b}$ implies $\mathfrak{a}=^\ast\mathfrak{b}$ for all cardinals $\mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b}$ and all nonzero natural numbers $m$.</description>

      <title>Definability of mad families of vector spaces and two local Ramsey theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a vector space over a countable field of dimension $\aleph_0$. Two infinite-dimensional subspaces $V,W \subseteq E$ are almost disjoint if $V \cap W$ is finite-dimensional. This paper provides some improvements on results about the definability of maximal almost disjoint families (mad families) of subspaces in [17]. We show that a full mad family of block subspaces exists assuming either $\frak{p} = \max\{\frak{b},\frak{s}\}$ or a positive answer to a problem in [17], improving Smythe's construction assuming $\frak{p} = \frak{c}$. We also discuss the abstract Mathias forcing introduced by Di Prisco-Mijares-Nieto in [11], and apply it to show that in the Solovay's model obtained by the collapse of a Mahlo cardinal, there are no full mad families of block subspaces over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>Zarankiewicz bounds from distal regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since K\H{o}v\'ari, S\'os, and Tur\'an proved upper bounds for the Zarankiewicz problem in 1954, much work has been undertaken to improve these bounds, and some have done so by restricting to particular classes of graphs. In 2017, Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl proved better bounds for semialgebraic binary relations, and this work was extended by Do in the following year to arbitrary semialgebraic relations. In this paper, we show that Zarankiewicz bounds in the shape of Do's are enjoyed by all relations satisfying the distal regularity lemma, an improved version of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma satisfied by relations definable in distal structures (a vast generalisation of o-minimal structures).</description>
