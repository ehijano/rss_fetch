      <title>Optimal location of reinforced inertia to stabilize power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced the inertia in the modernized power grid, making the system more vulnerable. One way to stabilize the grid is to add extra inertia from unused turbines, called the fast frequency response (FFR), to the existing grid. However, reinforcing inertia can cause unintended consequences, such as more significant avalanche failures. This phenomenon is known as the Braess paradox. Here, we propose a method to find the optimal position of FFR. This method is applied to the second-order Kuramoto model to find an effective position to mitigate cascading failures. To address this, we propose a method to evaluate a ratio between the positive effects of mitigation and the negative consequences. Through this analysis, we find that the peripheral area of the network is a seemingly effective location for inertia reinforcement across various reinforcement scales. This strategy provides essential insights for enhancing the stability of power grids in a time of widespread renewable energy usage.</description>

      <title>The recurrence of groups inhibits the information spreading under higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling social systems as networks based on pairwise interactions between individuals offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying their dynamics. However, the majority of social interactions occur within groups of individuals, characterized by higher-order structures. The mechanisms driving group formation and the impact of higher-order interactions, which arise from group dynamics, on information spreading in face-to-face interaction networks remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we examine some representative human face-to-face interaction data and find the recurrent patterns of groups. Moreover, we extend the force-directed motion (FDM) model with the forces derived from similarity distances within a hidden space to reproduce the recurrent group patterns and many key properties of face-to-face interaction networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the FDM model effectively predicts information-spreading behaviors under higher-order interactions. Finally, our results reveal that the recurrence of triangular groups inhibits the spread of information in face-to-face interaction networks, and the higher-order interactions will make this phenomenon more pronounced. These findings represent a significant advancement in the understanding of group formation and may open new avenues for research into the effects of group interactions on information propagation processes.</description>

      <title>Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social dilemmas requires models that capture the complexity of real-world interactions. While network frameworks have provided valuable insights to model the evolution of cooperation, they are unable to encode group interactions properly. Here, we introduce a general higher-order network framework for multi-player games on structured populations. Our model considers multi-dimensional strategies, based on the observation that social behaviours are affected by the size of the group interaction. We investigate dynamical and structural coupling between different orders of interactions, revealing the crucial role of nested multilevel interactions, and showing how such features can enhance cooperation beyond the limit of traditional models with uni-dimensional strategies. Our work identifies the key drivers promoting cooperative behaviour commonly observed in real-world group social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Representing the Disciplinary Structure of Physics: A Comparative Evaluation of Graph and Text Embedding Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning offer new ways to represent and study scholarly works and the space of knowledge. Graph and text embeddings provide a convenient vector representation of scholarly works based on citations and text. Yet, it is unclear whether their representations are consistent or provide different views of the structure of science. Here, we compare graph and text embedding by testing their ability to capture the hierarchical structure of the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) of papers published by the American Physical Society (APS). We also provide a qualitative comparison of the overall structure of the graph and text embeddings for reference. We find that neural network-based methods outperform traditional methods and graph embedding methods such as node2vec are better than other methods at capturing the PACS structure. Our results call for further investigations into how different contexts of scientific papers are captured by different methods, and how we can combine and leverage such information in an interpretable manner.</description>
