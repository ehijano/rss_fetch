      <title>Nonequilibrium Green's Function Formalism Applicable to Discrete Impurities in Semiconductor Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new theoretical framework for the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) scheme is presented to account for the discrete nature of impurities doped in semiconductor nanostructures. The short-range part of impurity potential is included as scattering potential in the self-energy due to spatially localized impurity scattering, and the long-range part of impurity potential is treated as the self-consistent Hartree potential by coupling with the Poisson equation. The position-dependent impurity scattering rate under inhomogeneous impurity profiles is systematically derived so that its physical meaning is clarified. The position dependence of the scattering rate turns out to be represented by the `center of mass' coordinates in the Wigner coordinates, rather than the real-space coordinates. Consequently, impurity scattering is intrinsically nonlocal in space. The proposed framework is applied to cylindrical thin wires under the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) approximation. We show explicitly how the discrete nature of impurities affects the transport properties such as electrostatic potential, local density of states, carrier density, scattering rates, and mobility.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional talc as a natural hyperbolic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17340v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that two-dimensional talc, a naturally abundant mineral, supports hyperbolic phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared wavelengths, thus offering a low-cost alternative to synthetic polaritonic materials. Using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and synchrotron infrared nano spectroscopy (SINS), we reveal tunable HPhP modes in talc flakes of a long lifetime. These results highlight the potential of natural 2D talc crystals to constituting an effective platform for establishing scalable optoelectronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Third-order rectification in centrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectification, the conversion of AC fields into DC currents, is crucial for optoelectronic applications such as energy harvesting and wireless communication. However, it is conventionally absent in centrosymmetric systems due to vanishing second-order optical responses. Here, we demonstrate significant rectification and photogalvanic currents in centrosymmetric metals via third-order nonlinear optical responses, driven by finite Fermi surface and disorder-induced contributions. We unveil distinct band geometric mechanisms -- including Berry curvature quadrupole, Fermi surface injection, and shift effects -- and classify all symmetry-allowed rectification responses. Using graphene as an example, we illustrate rectification tunability via light polarization and helicity, enabling rectification engineering in centrosymmetric materials for energy-efficient photodetection and terahertz applications.</description>

      <title>Electron trapping via magnetic and laser fields in gapped graphene quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electron scattering in graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under the combined influence of a magnetic field, an energy gap, and circularly polarized laser irradiation. Using the Floquet approach and the Dirac equation, we derive the energy spectrum solutions. The scattering coefficients are calculated explicitly by matching the eigenspinors at the GQD interfaces, revealing a dependence on several physical parameters. In addition, we compute the scattering efficiency, the electron density distribution, and the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. Our numerical results show that the presence of an energy gap and circularly polarized laser irradiation enhances the localization of the electron density within the GQDs, leading to an increase in the lifetime of the quasi-bound states. In particular, the intensity and polarization of the light influence the scattering process, allowing the manipulation of the electron confinement state. These results highlight the importance of combining magnetic fields and polarized light to control electronic transport in graphene nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Selective Fabrication of Monolayer 1H- and 1T'-WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We selectively fabricated monolayers of octahedral (1H) and distorted trigonal (1T') WTe2 on graphene/SiC(0001) by controlling the substrate temperature during epitaxy. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, combined with first-principles band-structure calculations, has revealed several drastic differences between these two polymorphs. The 1T' phase exhibits a semiconducting character with a nearly-zero energy gap, while the 1H phase shows a large band gap and the band splitting at the K/K' point. The present results pave a pathway toward developing nanoelectronic devices based with WTe2.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Raman scattering in layered AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$: Helical modes and excitation energy-dependent intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural anisotropy in layered two-dimensional materials can lead to highly anisotropic optical absorption which, in turn, can profoundly a^ect their phonon modes. These e^ects include lattice orientation-dependent and excitation energy-dependent mode intensities that can enable new phononic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we report anomalous Raman spectra in single-crystalline AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, a layered antiferromagnetic material. Density functional theory calculations and experimental measurements reveal several unique features in the Raman spectra of bulk and exfoliated AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ crystals including three helical vibrational modes. These modes exhibit large Raman optical activities (circular intensity di^erences) in bulk AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, which progressively decrease with thickness. We also observe strong excitation energy dependent peak intensities as well as a decrease in anti-Stokes peak intensities at room temperature with increasing excitation energy, resulting in an apparent cooling by up to 220 K. All of these anomalies in bulk and exfoliated flakes are attributed to the unique ABC layer stacking structure of AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ and to the smaller unit cell volume that causes hybridization between the Se and Ag/Cr electron densities, resulting in charge transfer and strongly a^ecting the electron-phonon coupling. This work thus positions AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ as an exciting new 2D material for optical and phononic applications.</description>

      <title>Keldysh field theory approach to direct electric and thermoelectric currents in quantum dots coupled to superconducting leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of a quantum dot contacted to two superconducting reservoirs by means of the Keldysh field theory approach. We determine the direct current occurring at equilibrium and the electric and thermoelectric currents triggered when the system is driven out of equilibrium by a voltage or a temperature bias, also for a normal-quantum dot-superconductor junction. In particular, we derive and present for the first time the explicit expression of the thermoelectric current in a superconductor-quantum dot-superconductor junction for any values of the temperature difference between the superconducting leads. We show that in the linear response regime, in addition to the Josephson current, a weakly phase-dependent thermoelectric contribution occurs, providing that electron-hole symmetry is broken. Far from linearity, instead, other contributions arise which lead to thermoelectric effects, dominant at weak coupling, also in the presence of particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of the Optical Bound on Maximal Berry Curvature: Applications to Two-Dimensional Time-Reversal-Symmetric Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing (certain energy range of) experimental data on optical conductivity, one can identify topological signatures using the integrated optical bound. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. We find that the resulting momentum integration of the refined TDI provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum volume (QV) variations and topological phase transitions. We argue that double QV can be treated as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.</description>

      <title>Topological insulator constrictions -- Dirac particles in a magneto-chiral box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magneto-transport through topological insulator nanowires shaped in the form of a constriction, as can be obtained by etching techniques. The magnetic field is coaxial, potentially turning the nanowire into a magneto-chiral junction. We show in a detailed analytical and numerical study that two main transport regimes emerge, depending on the central narrow region being short or long as compared to the magnetic length at the junction entrance and exit. In both cases the central region hosts Dirac-particle-in-a-box states due to magnetic confinement, whose conductance properties are strongly influenced by Landau levels at the ends of the constriction. Notably, in the low-energy regime only chiral states with a specific handedness can transport charge across the junction. Based on these properties and general symmetry considerations we argue that the shaped nanowire should exhibit strong magneto-chiral non-reciprocal transport beyond linear response. We employ a numerical tight-binding implementation of an effective 2D model on a non-homogeneous grid, capable of simulating samples of realistic sizes, and test its soundness against full simulations for scaled-down 3D topological insulator wires.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in a dipolar excitonic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum oscillations in magnetization or resistivity are a defining feature of metals subject to an external magnetic field. The phenomenon is generally not expected in insulators without a Fermi surface. The observations of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulating materials have provided a rare counterexample and attracted much theoretical interest. However, the magnetic oscillations in correlated insulators remain poorly understood. Here we report the observations of resistivity quantum oscillations in an excitonic insulator realized in Coulomb-coupled electron-hole double layers with gate-tunability that allows the phenomenon to be explored in a more controllable fashion than in bulk materials. When the cyclotron energy of the electrons or holes is tuned to be comparable to or larger than the exciton binding energy, recurring transitions between excitonic insulators and electron-hole decoupled quantum Hall states are observed. Compressibility measurements show an oscillatory exciton binding energy as a function of magnetic field and electron-hole pair density. Coulomb drag measurements further reveal the formation of excitons with finite angular momentum. Our results are qualitatively captured by mean-field theory calculations. The study demonstrates a new platform for studying quantum oscillations in correlated insulators.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in quasi-flat band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional material described by a two-band heavy-fermion model, where hybridization between a dispersive band and a flat band introduces a quasi-flat dispersion to the otherwise localized flat-band electrons. The enhanced density of states in the quasi-flat band raises the crossover temperature for an inhomogeneous preformed Cooper pair state. The superconducting phase stiffness and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are governed by the Fermi surface contribution induced by hybridization. We compute the crossover and BKT temperatures, revealing a dome-like dependence on doping. When the pairing amplitude exceeds the energy width of the quasi-flat band, superconductivity is suppressed, and the inhomogeneous pairing regime expands linearly with increasing interaction strength. However, in the opposite case, the BKT temperature reaches a maximum value that is only numerically less than the energy width of the quasi-flat band. We also discuss our results in the context of superconductivity in graphene-based systems.</description>

      <title>L\'evy noise effects on Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review three different approaches to investigate the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of a Josephson junction affected by L\'evy-distributed current fluctuations. First, we study the lifetime in the metastable superconducting state of current-biased short and long junctions, in the presence of Gaussian and L\'evy noise sources. We highlight the noise-induced nonmonotonic behavior of the mean switching time as a function of noise intensity and driving frequency, that is the noise enhanced stability and the stochastic resonant activation, respectively. Then, we characterize the L\'evy noise source through the average voltage drop across a current-biased junction. The voltage measurement versus the noise intensity allows to infer the value of the stability index that characterizes L\'evy-distributed fluctuations. The numerical calculation of the average voltage drop across the junction well agrees with the analytical estimate of the average velocity for L\'evy-driven escape processes from a metastable state. Finally, we look at the distribution of switching currents out of the zero-voltage state, when a L\'evy noise signal is added to a linearly ramped bias current. The analysis of the cumulative distribution function of the switching currents gives information on both the L\'evy stability index and the intensity of fluctuations. We present also a theoretical model to catch the features of the L\'evy signal from a measured distribution of switching currents. The phenomena discussed in this work can pave the way for an effective and reliable Josephson-based scheme to characterize L\'evy components eventually embedded in an unknown noisy signal.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed color centers in a silicon photonic cavity array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is central to the modular scaling of quantum processors and establishing quantum networks. Color centers with telecom-band transitions and long spin coherence times are suitable candidates for long-distance entanglement distribution. However, high-bandwidth memory-enhanced quantum communication is limited by high-yield, scalable creation of efficient spin-photon interfaces. Here, we develop a silicon photonics platform consisting of arrays of bus-coupled cavities. The coupling to a common bus waveguide enables simultaneous access to individually addressable cavity-enhanced T center arrays. We demonstrate frequency-multiplexed operation of two T centers in separate photonic crystal cavities. In addition, we investigate the cavity enhancement of a T center through hybridized modes formed between physically distant cavities. Our results show that bus-coupled arrays of cavity-enhanced color centers could enable efficient on-chip and long-distance entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>High-field Breakdown and Thermal Characterization of Indium Tin Oxide Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 {\deg}C and ~340 {\deg}C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, but failure appears primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide valuable insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of ITO devices, paving the way for more reliable and high-performance amorphous oxide transistors.</description>

      <title>Spin-forbidden excitations in the magneto-optical spectra of CrI$_3$ tuned by covalency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-forbidden ($\Delta S \neq 0$) multiplet excitations and their coupling to magnetic properties are of increasing importance for magneto-optical studies of correlated materials. Nonetheless, the mechanisms for optically brightening these transitions and their generality remain poorly understood. Here, we report magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) CrI$_3$. Previously unreported spin-forbidden ($\Delta S = 1$) ${}^4A_{2\mathrm{g}} \to{}^2E_\mathrm{g}/{}^2T_{1\mathrm{g}}$ Cr${}^{3+}$ $dd$ excitations are observed near the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitation threshold. The assignment of these excitations and their Cr$^{3+}$ multiplet character is established through complementary Cr $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements along with charge transfer multiplet (CTM) calculations and chemical trends in the chromium trihalide series (CrX$_3$, X = Cl, Br, I). We utilize the high sensitivity of MCD spectroscopy to study the thickness dependent optical response. The spin-forbidden excitations remain robust down to the monolayer limit and exhibit a significant magnetic field tunability across the antiferromagnetic to FM transition in few-layer samples. This behavior is associated to changes in the metal-ligand covalency with magnetic state, as supported by our CTM analysis. Our results clarify the magneto-optical response of CrI$_3$ and identify covalency as a central mechanism for the brightening and field-tunability of spin-forbidden multiplet excitations.</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body system exhibits nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement is one of quantities to characterize mixed state properties under decoherence. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the system-environmental entanglement for critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ -decoherence. We numerically find that the system-environmental entanglement exhibits a specific scaling law including a system-independent universal term ("$g$-function"). For the critical XXZ model, transition to strong-to-weak spontaneously symmetry breaking mixed state takes place. In that case, the $g$-function changes its value at decoherent transition point and gets double the value of system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. By studying Shannon entropy, we clarify origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

      <title>Unusual temperature dependence of the band structure associated with local atomic distortion in monolayer 1T'-WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state of monolayer 1T'-WTe2 has been a target of intensive debate on whether or not it is a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D TI) associated with exciton formation. We investigated the band structure of an epitaxial monolayer 1T'-WTe2 film grown on graphene/SiC(0001) in a wide temperature range of T = 40 - 400 K by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We observed an electron band above the Fermi level (EF) slightly away from the {\Gamma} point, together with four hole bands below EF just at the {\Gamma} point. This signifies an indirect band gap exceeding 0.1 eV in support of the 2D-TI phase with the inverted band structure. We uncovered an unexpectedly large downward shift of valence bands upon cooling, accompanied with an upward shift of the conduction band. Comparison of the ARPES-derived band structure with first-principles band calculations suggests that the observed band shift is ascribed to the systematic local atomic distortion of tungsten atoms, which should be incorporated into the interpretation of unusual transport properties of 1T'-WTe2.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Oleic Acid-Mediated Sulfur Vacancy Healing in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover the mechanism behind the enhancement of photoluminescence yield in monolayer WS$_2$ through oleic acid treatment, a promising scalable strategy for defect healing. By inducing sulfur vacancies through thermal treatment and monitoring the changes in photoluminescence yield and emission spectra, we demonstrate that oleic acid heals the sulfur vacancy by providing substitutional oxygen. Using density functional theory calculations, we provide insight into the underlying mechanism governing the oleic acid-mediated sulfur vacancy healing process. Our findings suggest that effective defect passivation by oxygen doping can be achieved through chemical treatment, opening a pathway for oxygen doping in transition metal dichalcogenides. However, we also highlight the limitations of chemical treatment, which may only lead to small increases in photoluminescence yield beyond a certain point.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Diode Effect in Josephson Interferometers with Multiband Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonreciprocal supercurrent phenomena in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that integrate Josephson junctions with single and multiband order parameters, which may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our results show that the magnetic field can independently control both the amplitude and direction of supercurrent rectification, depending on the multiband characteristics of the superconductors involved. We analyze the effects of zero and antiphase ({\pi}) pairing among different bands on the development of nonreciprocal effects and find that the rectification is not influenced by {\pi}-pairing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating multiband superconductors that break time-reversal symmetry produces significant signatures in rectification. The rectification exhibits an even parity dependence on the magnetic field and the average rectification amplitude across quantum flux multiples does not equal zero. These findings indicate that magnetic flux pumping can be accomplished with time-reversal symmetry broken multiband superconductors by adjusting the magnetic field. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights for identifying and utilizing phases with broken time-reversal symmetry in multiband superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Enhancement of radiative coupling efficiency between out-of-plane excitonic emitters in an indium selenide (InSe) film and an integrated waveguide formed by silicon (Si) Mie-resonant nanodisks is experimentally studied. Photoluminescence power at the resonant waveguide output is increased by~2.5 times at 950~nm in comparison with the case of a conventional rib waveguide of the same geometrical parameters due to the efficient excitation of Mie-type magnetic dipole resonances in individual nanoparticles. These results show inspiring possibilities for creating new on-chip light emitters for various integrated photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation Force and Torque on Moving Nanostructures with Anisotropic Optical Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.</description>

      <title>A trilinear quantum dot architecture for semiconductor spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.</description>

Abstract: The statistics of transmitted photons in microwave cavities play a foundational role in microwave quantum optics and its technological applications. By utilizing quantum mechanical phase-space methods, we here develop a general theory of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks consisting of driven cavities with beamsplitter interactions and two-mode-squeezing. The dynamics of the network can be captured by a Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the cavity fields, which generalizes to a Riccati equation, when counting fields are included. By solving the Riccati equation, we obtain the statistics of emitted and absorbed photons as well as the time-dependent correlations encoded in waiting time distributions and second-order coherence functions. To illustrate our theoretical framework, we first apply it to a simple linear network consisting of two coupled cavities, for which we evaluate the photon cross-correlations and discuss connections between the photon emission statistics and the entanglement between the cavities. We then consider a bosonic circulator consisting of three coupled cavities, for which we investigate how a synthetic flux may affect the direction of the photon flow, similarly to recent experiments. Our general framework paves the way for systematic investigations of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks.</description>

      <title>Electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall transport in unconventional Rashba systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear responses in transport experiments may unveil information and generate new phenomena in materials that are not accessible at linear order due to symmetry constraints. While the linear anomalous Hall response strictly requires the absence of time-reversal symmetry, the second-order, thus nonlinear, Hall response needs broken inversion symmetry. Recently, much effort has been made to obtain a second-order Hall voltage in response to a longitudinal ac driving current, both to obtain information about band geometric quantities and for its useful technological applications, including rectification and frequency doubling. Typically, additional material engineering is required in noncentrosymmetric systems to obtain second-order responses since it obeys a stringent crystallographic symmetry constraint. To circumvent this, an alternative route is to apply a dc electric field. In this Letter, we uncover an electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall effect in inversion-broken systems possessing experimentally accessible unconventional Rashba bands. We establish that the quantum metric, a geometrical feature of electronic wave functions providing information on the nontrivial structure of Bloch bands, is responsible for providing the nonlinear Hall response</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, a systematic classification of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize the Abelian eigenvalue topology of generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing topological invariants called resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by resultants. In a $D$-dimensional parameter space ($D\geq c$), the resultant winding number topologically characterize a $(D-c)$-dimensional manifold of generic [symmetry-protected] EP$n$s whose codimension is $c=2n-2$ [$c=n-1$]. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems for both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

Abstract: A recently proposed analytical solution for the equations of motion of the one-body Green function of the double quantum dot is extended to the out-of-equilibrium situation. By solving a linear system for the density correlators, not only the local occupations but also charge and heat currents as well as transport coefficients and the figure of merit are analytically derived in terms of system parameters and external driving forces. The emerging regions of stable occupation and finite currents are explained in terms of addition and removal energies, corresponding to the poles of the Green function. The analytical results are validated against the hierarchical equations of motion method, showing excellent agreement.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic memory element based on an anomalous Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a non-volatile memory element based on a lateral ferromagnetic Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane magnetization. The interplay between the latter and the intrinsic exchange field of the ferromagnet leads to a magnetoelectric effect that couples the charge current through the junction and its magnetization, such that by applying a current pulse the direction of the magnetic moment in F can be switched. The two memory states are encoded in the direction of the out-of-plane magnetization. With the aim to determine the optimal working temperature for the memory element, we explore the noise-induced effects on the averaged stationary magnetization by taking into account thermal fluctuations affecting both the Josephson phase and the magnetic moment dynamics. We investigate the switching process as a function of intrinsic parameters of the ferromagnet, such as the Gilbert damping and strength of the spin-orbit coupling, and proposed a non-destructive readout scheme based on a dc-SQUID. Additionally, we analyze a way to protect the memory state from external perturbations by voltage gating in systems with a both linear-in-momentum Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Strain activation of localized states in WSe2</title>

Abstract: Single-photon emission centers generated by controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation in monolayer WSe\(_2\) on a flexible polymer substrate are explored for applications in quantum technologies. Here, we study the response of these emitters to the polymer substrate's strain state, which is controlled by selecting the indentation force and by gradually thermally annealing the samples. In the indented areas, we observe sharp new photoluminescence (PL) peaks in the regions 1.62--1.68 eV and 1.70--1.73 eV, characterized by sublinear power dependence and spectral wandering. We find that these peaks arise only when the indentation force exceeds a few \(\mu\)N and generally redshift as the applied force increases. Conversely, after thermal annealing (\(T &lt; 60^{\circ}\)C), WSe\(_2\) experiences strain relaxation, leading to a blueshift of the peaks' spectral position and their ultimate disappearance. Our analysis of the peaks' positions vs. strain allows us to draw several conclusions about the nature of these emission. Specifically, we elucidate the roles of excitonic confinement and hybridization between free excitons and defect-related states, a process activated by the strain level. Overall, our approach suggests that the energy of localized emitters may be controlled via strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</description>

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Exploring van der Waals cuprate superconductors using a hybrid microwave circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional van der Waals materials is a frontier of condensed matter physics and quantum devices. However, characterizing such materials remains challenging due to the limitations of bulk material techniques, necessitating the development of specialized methods. In this study, we investigate the superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x flakes by integrating them with a hybrid superconducting microwave resonator. The hybrid resonator is significantly modified by the interaction with the flake while maintaining a high quality factor. We also observe a significant upshift of the resonator frequency with increasing temperature, as well as a positive nonlinearity. These effects originate from a presently unknown microscopic mechanism within the flake, and can be modeled as a two-level system bath interacting with the resonant mode. Our findings open a path for high quality hybrid circuits with van der Waals flakes for exploring novel materials and developing new devices for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>
