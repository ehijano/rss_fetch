      <title>On the contact type conjecture for exact magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we answer a question posed in 1998 by Contreras, Iturriaga, Paternain, and Paternain, now known as the contact type conjecture. For a broad class of magnetic systems, we explicitly construct, on any closed manifold, an infinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic systems, which we refer to as magnetic systems of strong geodesic type. For each such system, there exists at least one null-homologous embedded periodic orbit on every energy level, with negative action for energies below the strict Ma\~n\'e critical value. As a consequence, the corresponding energy surfaces are not of contact type below this threshold. Thus, for this class of systems, the contact type conjecture holds true. Moreover, for these systems, both the strict and the lowest Ma\~n\'e critical values can be computed explicitly, and they coincide whenever the aforementioned periodic magnetic geodesic is contractible, without requiring any additional assumptions on the manifold. Several remarkable multiplicity results also hold, guaranteeing arbitrarily large numbers of embedded null-homologous periodic magnetic geodesics on every energy level. We illustrate the richness of this class through two types of examples. First, on any non-aspherical manifold, there exists a dense subset of the space of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, one can construct an infinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic fields yielding magnetic systems of strong geodesic type. Second, on any closed contact manifold for which the strong Weinstein conjecture holds, one can construct an infinite-dimensional space of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, the magnetic system induced by the fixed contact form is of strong geodesic type.</description>

      <title>On the Lagrangian Hofer geometry of Clifford tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the space of Lagrangians which are Hamiltonian isotopic to the Clifford torus in a complex projective space or in the four-dimensional quadric, taken with Chekanov's Lagrangian Hofer metric, contains a quasi-isometric copy of the real line, and in particular has infinite diameter.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-holomorphic curves with a fixed complex structure in positive symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a symplectic version of a conjecture of Lian and Pandharipande: in sufficiently high degree, the fixed-domain Gromov-Witten invariants of positive symplectic manifolds are signed counts of pseudo-holomorphic curves. The original conjecture in the complex algebraic setting was recently disproved by Beheshti et al. However, we show that the statement holds when the complex structure is replaced by a generic almost complex structure. The proof relies on showing that the fixed-domain Gromov-Witten pseudocycle can be constructed without the use of inhomogeneous or domain-dependent perturbations, which answers positively a question posed by Ruan and Tian.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>
