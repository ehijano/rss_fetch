      <title>A Short Proof of the Existence of $K_q^r$-absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new short self-contained proof of the existence of $K_q^r$-absorbers. Combining this with the work of the first and third authors yields a proof of the Existence Conjecture for Combinatorial Designs that is not reliant on the construction of $K_q^r$-absorbers by Glock, K\"uhn, Lo, and Osthus.</description>

      <title>On monophonic position sets of Cartesian and lexicographic products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general position problem in graph theory asks for the number of vertices in a largest set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ such that no shortest path of $G$ contains more than two vertices of $S$. The analogous monophonic position problem is obtained from the general position problem by replacing ``shortest path" by ``induced path." This paper studies monophonic position sets in the Cartesian and lexicographic products of graphs. Sharp lower and upper bounds for the monophonic position number of Cartesian products are established, along with several exact values. For the lexicographic product, the monophonic position number is determined for arbitrary graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspecting known maximal Condorcet domains on 4 variables classified by Tobias Dittrich we find that 9 out of 18 of them are created using a certain composition of smaller domains. In this paper we describe this composition. We give sufficient conditions for the composition of two Condorcet domain to be a maximal Condorcet domain.</description>

      <title>Structure fault diameter of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure connectivity and substructure connectivity are innovative indicators for assessing network reliability and fault tolerance. Similarly, fault diameter evaluates fault tolerance and transmission delays in networks. This paper extends the concept of fault diameter by introducing two new variants: structure fault diameter and substructure fault diameter, derived from structure connectivity and substructure connectivity respectively. For a connected graph $G$ with $W$-structure connectivity $\kappa(G;W)$ or $W$-substructure connectivity $\kappa^s(G;W)$, the $W$-structure fault diameter $D_f(G;W)$ and $W$-substructure fault diameter $D_f^s(G;W)$ are defined as the maximum diameter of any subgraph of $G$ resulting from removing fewer than $\kappa(G;W)-1$ $W$-structures or $\kappa^s(G;W)-1$ $W$-substructures. For the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with $n \geq 3$ and $1 \leq m \leq n - 2$, we determine both $D_f(Q_n;Q_m)$ and $D_f^s(Q_n;Q_1)$. These findings generalize existing results for the diameter and fault diameter of $Q_n$, providing a broader understanding of the hypercube's structural properties under fault conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum chromatic numbers of some graphs in Hamming schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum chromatic numbers of graphs is a hot research topic in recent years. However, the infinite family of graphs with known quantum chromatic numbers are rare, as far as we know, the only known such graphs (except for complete graphs, cycles, bipartite graphs and some trivial cases) are the Hadamard graphs $H_n$ with $2^n$ vertices and $n$ being a multiple of $4$. In this paper, we define a class of graphs named as generalized Hadamard graphs, we determined the quantum chromatic numbers of one class of such graphs. Notably, this is the second known family of graphs with the quantum chromatic numbers are explicitly determined except for some cases aforementioned. We also provide some bounds for the quantum chromatic numbers of some other generalized Hadamard graphs. Consequently, we can obtain the quantum chromatic numbers of products of some graphs.</description>

      <title>Infinite families of planar graphs of a given injective chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An injective colouring of a graph is a colouring in which every two vertices sharing a common neighbour receive a different colour. Chen, Hahn, Raspaud and Wang conjectured that every planar graph of maximum degree $\Delta \ge 3$ admits an injective colouring with at most $\lfloor 3\Delta/2\rfloor$ colours. This was later disproved by Lu\v{z}ar and \v{S}krekovski for certain small and even values of $\Delta$ and they proposed a new refined conjecture. Using an algorithm for determining the injective chromatic number of a graph, i.e. the smallest number of colours for which the graph admits an injective colouring, we give computational evidence for Lu\v{z}ar and \v{S}krekovski's conjecture and extend their results by presenting an infinite family of $3$-connected planar graphs for each $\Delta$ (except for $4$) attaining their bound, whereas they only gave a finite amount of examples for each $\Delta$. Hence, together with another infinite family of maximum degree $4$, we provide infinitely many counterexamples to the conjecture by Chen et al. for each $\Delta$ if $4\le \Delta \le 7$ and every even $\Delta \ge 8$. We provide similar evidence for analogous conjectures by La and \v{S}torgel and Lu\v{z}ar, \v{S}krekovski and Tancer when the girth is restricted as well. Also in these cases we provide infinite families of $3$-connected planar graphs attaining the bounds of these conjectures for certain maximum degrees $\Delta\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Parabolic restrictions and double deformations of weight multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce some (p,q)-deformations of the weight multiplicities for therepresentations of any simple Lie algebra g over the complexnumbers. This is done by associating the indeterminate q to the positiveroots of a parabolic subsystem of g and the indeterminate p tothe remaining positive roots. When p=q, we so recover the usual Lusztiganalogues of weight multiplicities. We then study the positivity of thecoefficients in these double deformations and prove in particular a conjectureby Lee.</description>

      <title>The maximum number of digons formed by pairwise crossing pseudocircles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1972, Branko Gr\"unbaum conjectured that any arrangement of $n&gt;2$ pairwise crossing pseudocircles in the plane can have at most $2n-2$ digons (regions enclosed by exactly two pseudoarcs), with the bound being tight. While this conjecture has been confirmed for cylindrical arrangements of pseudocircles and more recently for geometric circles, we extend these results to any simple arrangement of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles. Using techniques from the above-mentioned special cases, we provide a complete proof of Gr\"unbaum's conjecture that has stood open for over five decades.</description>

      <title>Codegree and regularity of stable set polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The codegree ${\rm codeg}(P)$ of a lattice polytope $P$ is a fundamental invariant in discrete geometry. In the present paper, we investigate the codegree of the stable set polytope $P_G$ associated with a graph $G$. Specifically, we establish the inequalities \[ \omega(G) + 1 \leq {\rm codeg}(P_G) \leq \chi(G) + 1, \] where $\omega(G)$ and $\chi(G)$ denote the clique number and the chromatic number of G, respectively. Furthermore, an explicit formula for ${\rm codeg}(P_G)$ is given when G is either a line graph or an $h$-perfect graph. Finally, as an application of these results, we provide upper and lower bounds on the regularity of the toric ring associated with $P_G$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-orthogonal extension of symmetric matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n\times n$ real matrix $Q$ is quasi-orthogonal if $Q^{\top}Q=qI_{n}$ for some positive real number $q$. If $M$ is a principal sub-matrix of a quasi-orthogonal matrix $Q$, we say that $Q$ is a quasi-orthogonal extension of $M$. In a recent work, the authors have investigated this notion for the class of real skew-symmetric matrices. Using a different approach, this paper addresses the case of symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Zarankiewicz problem for bipartite subdivisions with applications to incidence geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bipartite graph $H$, its \textit{linear threshold} is the smallest real number $\sigma$ such that every bipartite graph $G = (U \sqcup V, E)$ with unbalanced parts $|V| \gtrsim |U|^\sigma$ and without a copy of $H$ must have a linear number of edges $|E| \lesssim |V|$. We prove that the linear threshold of the \textit{complete bipartite subdivision} graph $K_{s,t}'$ is at most $\sigma_s = 2 - 1/s$. Moreover, we show that any $\sigma &lt; \sigma_s$ is less than the linear threshold of $K_{s,t}'$ for sufficiently large $t$ (depending on $s$ and $\sigma$).
  Some geometric applications of this result are given: we show that any $n$ points and $n$ lines in the complex plane without an $s$-by-$s$ grid determine $O(n^{4/3 - c})$ incidences for some constant $c &gt; 0$ depending on $s$; and for certain pairs $(p,q)$, we establish nontrivial lower bounds on the number of distinct distances determined by $n$ points in the plane under the condition that every $p$-tuple determines at least $q$ distinct distances.</description>

      <title>Thron-type continued fractions (T-fractions) for some classes of increasing trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce some classes of increasing labeled and multilabeled trees, and we show that these trees provide combinatorial interpretations for certain Thron-type continued fractions with coefficients that are quasi-affine of period 2. Our proofs are based on bijections from trees to labeled Motzkin or Schr\"oder paths; these bijections extend the well-known bijection of Fran\c{c}on--Viennot (1979) interpreted in terms of increasing binary trees. This work can also be viewed as a sequel to the recent work of Elvey Price and Sokal (2020), where they provide combinatorial interpretations for Thron-type continued fractions with coefficients that are affine. Towards the end of the paper, we conjecture an equidistribution of vincular patterns on permutations.</description>

Abstract: Blundell, Buesing, Davies, Veli\v{c}kovi\'c, and Williamson recently introduced the notion of a hypercube decomposition for an interval in Bruhat order. Using this structure, they conjectured a recurrence formula which, if shown for all Bruhat intervals, would imply the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of the symmetric group. In this article, we prove their conjecture for lower intervals $[e,v]$.</description>

      <title>$k$-loose elements and $k$-paving matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a matroid of rank $r$ and a non-negative integer $k$, an element is called $k$-loose if all circuits containing it have size greater than $r-k$. Zaslavsky and the author previously characterized all binary matroids with a $1$-loose element. In this paper, we establish a linear bound on the size of a binary matroid, in terms of its rank, that contains a $k$-loose element. A matroid is $k$-paving if all its elements are $k$-loose. Rajpal showed that for a prime power $q$, the rank of a $GF(q)$ matroid that is $k$-paving is bounded. We provide a bound on the rank of $GF(q)$-matroids that are cosimple and have two $k$-loose elements. Consequently, we deduce a bound on the rank of $GF(q)$ matroids that are $k$-paving. Additionally, we provide a bound on the size of binary matroids that are $k$-paving.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree III: The exchangeable partition representation and the fringe tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. Study of structure theory and explicit quantitative aspects of the model is an active research topic. It turns out that many results have several different proofs, and detailed studies of analytic proofs are given elsdewhere (via analysis of recursions and via Mellin transforms). This article describes two core probabilistic methods for studying $n \to \infty$ asymptotics of the basic finite-$n$-leaf models.
  (i) There is a canonical embedding into a continuous-time model, that is a random tree CTCS(n) on $n$ leaves with real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out to be more convenient to study. The family (CTCS(n), $n \ge 2)$ is consistent under a ``delete random leaf and prune" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive construction (the {\em growth algorithm}) of (CTCS(n), $n \ge 2)$ as $n$ increases, and then to a limit structure CTCS$(\infty)$ which can be formalized via exchangeable partitions, in some ways analogous to the Brownian continuum random tree.
  (ii) There is an explicit description of the limit fringe distribution relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if a graph has minimum vertex degree at least d and girth at least g, where (d, g) is (3, 6) or (4, 4), then the incidence system of the graph has a (possibly infinite-dimensional) quantum solution over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for every choice of vertex weights and integer $p \geq 2$. In particular, there are linear systems over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, for $p$ an odd prime, such that the corresponding linear system nonlocal game has a perfect commuting-operator strategy, but no perfect classical strategy.</description>

      <title>The strong chromatic index of 1-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic index $\chi'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k$ for which $G$ admits an edge $k$-coloring such that any two adjacent edges have distinct colors. The strong chromatic index $\chi'_s(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest $k$ such that $G$ has an edge $k$-coloring with the condition that any two edges at distance at most 2 receive distinct colors. A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that each edge is crossed by at most one other edge. In this paper, we show that every graph $G$ with maximum average degree $\bar{d}(G)$ has $\chi'_{s}(G)\le (2\bar{d}(G)-1)\chi'(G)$. As a corollary, we prove that every 1-planar graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ has $\chi'_{\rm s}(G)\le 14\Delta$, which improves a result, due to Bensmail et al., which says that $\chi'_{\rm s}(G)\le 24\Delta$ if $\Delta\ge 56$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of tree-type diagrams assembled from oriented chains of edges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of tree-type diagrams that arise in studies of the cumulant expansion in discrete Erd\H os-R\'enyi random matrix models. Using a version of the Pr\" ufer code, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of tree-type diagrams assembled from $k$ oriented chains of $q$ edges. Using this modified Pr\"ufer codification, we get an explicit expression for sum overs weighted tree-type diagrams with a weight depending on multiplicity of edges. We describe similar results for tree-type diagrams assembled from chains that are not necessarily regular.</description>

      <title>Aharoni's rainbow cycle conjecture holds up to an additive constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Aharoni proposed the following generalization of the Caccetta-H\"{a}ggkvist conjecture: if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil n/r \rceil$.
  In this paper, we prove that, for fixed $r$, Aharoni's conjecture holds up to an additive constant. Specifically, we show that for each fixed $r \geq 1$, there exists a constant $\alpha_r \in O(r^5 \log^2 r)$ such that if $G$ is a simple $n$-vertex edge-colored graph with $n$ color classes of size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $n/r + \alpha_r$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Proper Conflict-Free Colouring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper conflict-free colouring of a graph is a colouring of the vertices such that any two adjacent vertices receive different colours, and for every non-isolated vertex $v$, some colour appears exactly once on the neighbourhood of $v$. Caro, Petru\v{s}evski and \v{S}krekovski conjectured that every connected graph with maximum degree $\Delta \geq 3$ has a proper conflict-free colouring with at most $\Delta+1$ colours. This conjecture holds for $\Delta=3$ and remains open for $\Delta \geq 4$. In this paper we prove that this conjecture holds asymptotically; namely, every graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ has a proper conflict-free colouring with $(1+o(1))\Delta$ colours.</description>

      <title>Peaceful Colourings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce peaceful colourings, a variant of $h$-conflict free colourings. We call a colouring with no monochromatic edges $p$-peaceful if for each vertex $v$, there are at most $p$ neighbours of $v$ coloured with a colour appearing on another neighbour of $v$. An $h$-conflict-free colouring of a graph is a (vertex)-colouring with no monochromatic edges so that for every vertex $v$, the number of neighbours of $v$ which are coloured with a colour appearing on no other neighbour of $v$ is at least the minimum of $h$ and the degree of $v$. If $G$ is $\Delta$-regular then it has an $h$-conflict free colouring precisely if it has a $(\Delta-h)$-peaceful colouring. We focus on the minimum $p_\Delta$ of those $p$ for which every graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has a $p$-peaceful colouring with $\Delta+1$ colours. We show that $p_\Delta &gt; (1-\frac{1}{e}-o(1))\Delta$ and that for graphs of bounded codegree, $p_\Delta \leq (1-\frac{1}{e}+o(1))\Delta$. We ask if the latter result can be improved by dropping the bound on the codegree. As a partial result, we show that $p_\Delta \leq \frac{8000}{8001}\Delta$ for sufficiently large $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Hereditary Graph Product Structure Theory and Induced Subgraphs of Strong Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the celebrated Planar Product Structure Theorem by Dujmovic et al, and also related graph product structure results, can be formulated with the induced subgraph containment relation. Precisely, we prove that if a graph G is a subgraph of the strong product of a graph Q of bounded maximum degree (such as a path) and a graph M of bounded tree-width, then G is an induced subgraph of the strong product of Q and a graph M' of bounded tree-width being at most exponential in the maximum degree of Q and the tree-width of M. In particular, if G is planar, we show that G is an induced subgraph of the strong product of a path and a graph of tree-width 39. In the course of proving this result, we introduce and study H-clique-width, a new single structural measure that captures a hereditary analogue of the traditional product structure (where, informally, the strong product has one factor from the graph class H and one factor of bounded clique-width).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the number of occurrences of subwords (non-consecutive sub-sequences) in a given word. We first define the notion of subword entropy of a given word that measures the maximal number of occurrences among all possible subwords. We then give upper and lower bounds of minimal subword entropy for words of fixed length in a fixed alphabet, and also showing that minimal subword entropy per letter has a limit value. A better upper bound of minimal subword entropy for a binary alphabet is then given by looking at certain families of periodic words. We also give some conjectures based on experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: Kazhdan and Lusztig introduce the $W$-graphs to describe the cells and molecules corresponding to the Coxeter groups. Building on this foundation, Lusztig defines the a-funtion to classify the cells, as well as the molecules. Marberg then generalizes Kazhdan and Lusztig's $W$-graphs, using fixed-point-free involutions as their indices. The molecules of the two new $S_n$-graphs are then classified via two correspondence similar to RSK correspondence by Marberg and me. In this paper, we define an analogue of the Lusztig a-function and finish the classification of cells by proving that every molecule in the $S_n$-graphs is indeed a cell.</description>

      <title>Growth estimates and diameter bounds for untwisted classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Babai's conjecture states that, for any finite simple non-abelian group $G$, the diameter of $G$ is bounded by $(\log|G|)^{C}$ for some absolute constant $C$. We prove that, for any untwisted classical group $G$ of rank $r$ defined over a field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with $q$ not too small with respect to $r$, \begin{equation*} \mathrm{diam}(G(\mathbb{F}_{q}))\leq(\log|G(\mathbb{F}_{q})|)^{408r^{4}}. \end{equation*} This bound improves on results by Breuillard, Green, and Tao [9], Pyber and Szab\'o [38], and, for $q$ large enough, also by Halasi, Mar\'oti, Pyber, and Qiao [16]. Our approach is in several ways closer to that of preexistent work by Helfgott [20], in that we give dimensional estimates (that is, bounds of the form $|A\cap V(\mathbb{F}_{q})|\ll|A^{C}|^{\dim(V)/\dim(G)}$, where $A$ is any generating set) for varieties $V$ of specific types, and work in the Lie algebra whenever possible. One of our main tools is a new, more efficient form of escape from subvarieties.</description>

      <title>Earthquake theorem for cluster algebras of finite type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cluster algebraic generalization of Thurston's earthquake map for the cluster algebras of finite type, which we call the \emph{cluster earthquake map}. It is defined by gluing exponential maps, which is modeled after the earthquakes along ideal arcs. We prove an analogue of the earthquake theorem, which states that the cluster earthquake map gives a homeomorphism between the spaces of $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{trop}$- and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued points of the cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety. For those of type $A_n$ and $D_n$, the cluster earthquake map indeed recovers the earthquake maps for marked disks and once-punctured marked disks, respectively. Moreover, we investigate certain asymptotic behaviors of the cluster earthquake map, which give rise to "continuous deformations" of the Fock--Goncharov fan.</description>

      <title>Online Bipartite Matching in the Probe-Commit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical online bipartite matching problem in the probe-commit model. In this problem, when an online vertex arrives, its edges must be probed to determine if they exist, based on known edge probabilities. A probing algorithm must respect commitment, meaning that if a probed edge exists, it must be used in the matching. Additionally, each online vertex has a patience constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to an online vertex's adjacent edges. We introduce a new configuration linear program (LP) which we prove is a relaxation of an optimal offline probing algorithm. Using this LP, we establish the following competitive ratios which depend on the model used to generate the instance graph, and the arrival order of its online vertices:
  - In the worst-case instance model, an optimal $1/e$ ratio when the vertices arrive in uniformly at random (u.a.r.) order.
  - In the known independently distributed (i.d.) instance model, an optimal $1/2$ ratio when the vertices arrive in adversarial order, and a $1-1/e$ ratio when the vertices arrive in u.a.r. order.
  The latter two results improve upon the previous best competitive ratio of $0.46$ due to Brubach et al. (Algorithmica 2020), which only held in the more restricted known i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) instance model. Our $1-1/e$-competitive algorithm matches the best known result for the prophet secretary matching problem due to Ehsani et al. (SODA 2018). Our algorithm is efficient and implies a $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for the special case when the graph is known. This is the offline stochastic matching problem, and we improve upon the $0.42$ approximation ratio for one-sided patience due to Pollner et al. (EC 2022), while also generalizing the $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for unbounded patience due to Gamlath et al. (SODA 2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a pair of non-isomorphic, bipartite graphs which are not distinguished by counting the number of homomorphisms to any tree. This answers a question motivated by Atserias et al. (LICS 2021). In order to establish the construction, we analyse the equivalence relations induced by counting homomorphisms to trees of diameter two and three and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for two graphs to be equivalent. We show that three is the optimal diameter for our construction.</description>
