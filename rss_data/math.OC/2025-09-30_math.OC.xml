      <title>Resource Allocation under Stochastic Demands using Shrinking Horizon Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally allocating a limited number of resources across time to maximize revenue under stochastic demands. This formulation is relevant in various areas of control, such as supply chain, ticket revenue maximization, healthcare operations, and energy allocation in power grids. We propose a bisection method to solve the static optimization problem and extend our approach to a shrinking horizon algorithm for the sequential problem. The shrinking horizon algorithm computes future allocations after updating the distribution of future demands by conditioning on the observed values of demand. We illustrate the method on a simple synthetic example with jointly log-normal demands, showing that it achieves performance close to a bound obtained by solving the prescient problem.</description>

      <title>Generating Differentially Private Networks with a Modified Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy has been used to privately calculate numerous network properties, but existing approaches often require the development of a new privacy mechanism for each property of interest. Therefore, we present a framework for generating entire networks in a differentially private way. Differential privacy is immune to post-processing, which allows for any network property to be computed and analyzed for a private output network, without weakening its protections. We consider undirected networks and develop a differential privacy mechanism that takes in a sensitive network and outputs a private network by randomizing its edge set. We prove that this mechanism does provide differential privacy to a network's edge set, though it induces a complex distribution over the space of output graphs. We then develop an equivalent privacy implementation using a modified Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model that constructs an output graph edge by edge, and it is efficient and easily implementable, even on large complex networks. Experiments implement $\varepsilon$-differential privacy with $\varepsilon=2.5$ when computing graph Laplacian spectra, and these results show the proposed mechanism incurs $49.34\%$ less error than the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Feedback and Gain Margins for Unicycle Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of globally strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for the challenging unicycle parking problem provides a foundation for pursuing optimality. We address this in the inverse optimal framework, thereby avoiding the need to solve the Hamilton$\unicode{x2013}$Jacobi$\unicode{x2013}$Bellman (HJB) equations, and establish a general result that is optimal with respect to a meaningful cost. We present several design examples that impose varying levels of penalty on the control effort, including arbitrarily bounded control. Furthermore, we show that the inverse optimal controller possesses an infinite gain margin thanks to the system being driftless, and leveraging this property, we extend the design to an adaptive controller that handles model uncertainty. Finally, we compare the performance of the non-adaptive inverse optimal controller with its adaptive counterpart.</description>

      <title>Half-Global Deadbeat Parking for Dubins Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for stabilizing the Dubins vehicle model to zero in finite time (deadbeat parking) by interpreting distance as a time-like variable. We develop control laws that bring the system to a desired position and orientation even when the forward velocity cannot be directly actuated. While the controllers employ inverse-distance gains, we show that the control input remains bounded for all time. In addition to basic deadbeat parking, we incorporate safety considerations by proposing algorithms that prevent the vehicle from crossing in front of the target, enforce deceleration as it approaches the target, and guarantee parking without curb violations. The resulting methods are well-suited for missile guidance and fixed-wing pursuit, but are broadly applicable to physical systems that are represented by the Dubins vehicle model.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization in Robust Control: Weak Convexity and Subgradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust control seeks stabilizing policies that perform reliably under adversarial disturbances, with $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control as a classical formulation. It is known that policy optimization of robust $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control naturally lead to nonsmooth and nonconvex problems. This paper builds on recent advances in nonsmooth optimization to analyze discrete-time static output-feedback $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. We show that the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ cost is weakly convex over any convex subset of a sublevel set. This structural property allows us to establish the first non-asymptotic deterministic convergence rate for the subgradient method under suitable assumptions. In addition, we prove a weak Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality in the state-feedback case, implying that all stationary points are globally optimal. We finally present a few numerical examples to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Loss-Transformation Invariance in the Damped Newton Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newton method is a powerful optimization algorithm, valued for its rapid local convergence and elegant geometric properties. However, its theoretical guarantees are usually limited to convex problems. In this work, we ask whether convexity is truly necessary. We introduce the concept of loss-transformation invariance, showing that damped Newton methods are unaffected by monotone transformations of the loss - apart from a simple rescaling of the step size. This insight allows difficult losses to be replaced with easier transformed versions, enabling convexification of many nonconvex problems while preserving the same sequence of iterates. Our analysis also explains the effectiveness of unconventional stepsizes in Newton's method, including values greater than one and even negative steps.</description>

      <title>Network Consensus in the Wasserstein Space of Probability Measures Defined on Multi-Dimensional Euclidean Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consensus problem -- achieving agreement among a network of agents -- is a central theme in both theory and applications. Recently, this problem has been extended from Euclidean spaces to the space of probability measures, where the natural notion of averaging is given by the Wasserstein barycenter. While prior work established convergence in one dimension, the case of higher dimensions poses additional challenges due to the curved geometry of Wasserstein space. In this paper, we develop a framework for analyzing such consensus algorithms by employing a Wasserstein version of Jensen's inequality. This tool provides convexity-type estimates that allow us to prove convergence of nonlinear consensus dynamics in the Wasserstein space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for optimal control of stochastic Wasserstein--Hamiltonian system on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control problems for Hamiltonian dynamics on graphs have wide-ranging applications in mechanics and quantum field theory, particularly in systems with graph-based structures. In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions for a new class of Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations arising from the optimal control of stochastic Wasserstein--Hamiltonian systems (SWHSs) on graphs. One distinctive feature of these HJB equations is the simultaneous involvement of the Wasserstein geometry on the Wasserstein space over graphs and the Euclidean geometry in physical space. The nonlinear geometric structure, along with the logarithmic potential induced by the graph-based state equation, adds further complexity to the analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce an energy-truncation technique within the doubling of variables framework, specifically designed to handle the interaction between the interiorly defined Wasserstein space on graphs and the unbounded Euclidean space. In particular, our findings demonstrate the well-posedness of HJB equations related to optimal control problems for both stochastic Schr\"odinger equation with polynomial nonlinearity and stochastic logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to develop HJB equations for the optimal control of SWHSs on graphs.</description>

      <title>A Martingale approach to continuous Portfolio Optimization under CVaR like constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a continuous-time portfolio optimization problem under an explicit constraint on the Deviation Conditional Value-at-Risk (DCVaR), defined as the difference between the CVaR and the expected terminal wealth. While the mean-CVaR framework has been widely explored, its time-inconsistency complicates the use of dynamic programming. We follow the martingale approach in a complete market setting, as in Gao et al. [4], and extend it by retaining an explicit DCVaR constraint in the problem formulation.  The optimal terminal wealth is obtained by solving a convex constrained minimization problem. This leads to a tractable and interpretable characterization of the optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>A Block-Activated Decomposition Algorithm for Multi-Stage Stochastic Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a block-activated decomposition algorithm for multi-stage stochastic variational inequalities with nonanticipativity constraints, which offers two computational novelties: (i) At each iteration, our method activates only a user-chosen block of scenarios. (ii) For each activated scenario, it employs the resolvent of the cost operator and the projector onto the constraint set separately. These features enhance computational tractability, in contrast with existing approaches, which often rely on evaluating the resolvent of the sum of the cost operator and normal cone operator of the constraint set. As an application, we demonstrate that in risk-averse stochastic programming with conditional value-at-risk objectives, our method requires only the projections onto constraint sets, together with solving a univariate equation involving the proximity operators of the cost functions.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop Gradient Algorithm for Pessimistic Bilevel Optimization via Smooth Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization has garnered significant attention in the machine learning community recently, particularly regarding the development of efficient numerical methods. While substantial progress has been made in developing efficient algorithms for optimistic bilevel optimization, the study of methods for solving Pessimistic Bilevel Optimization (PBO) remains relatively less explored, especially the design of fully first-order, single-loop gradient-based algorithms. This paper aims to bridge this research gap. We first propose a novel smooth approximation to the PBO problem, using penalization and regularization techniques. Building upon this approximation, we then propose SiPBA (Single-loop Pessimistic Bilevel Algorithm), a new gradient-based method specifically designed for PBO which avoids second-order derivative information or inner-loop iterations for subproblem solving. We provide theoretical validation for the proposed smooth approximation scheme and establish theoretical convergence for the algorithm SiPBA. Numerical experiments on synthetic examples and practical applications demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SiPBA.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for perspective cones of a class of nonnegative Legendre functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error bounds play a central role in the study of conic optimization problems, including the analysis of convergence rates for numerous algorithms. Curiously, those error bounds are often H\"olderian with exponent 1/2. In this paper, we try to explain the prevalence of the 1/2 exponent by investigating generic properties of error bounds for conic feasibility problems where the underlying cone is a perspective cone constructed from a nonnegative Legendre function on $\mathbb{R}$. Our analysis relies on the facial reduction technique and the computation of one-step facial residual functions (1-FRFs). Specifically, under appropriate assumptions on the Legendre function, we show that 1-FRFs can be taken to be H\"olderian of exponent 1/2 almost everywhere with respect to the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure. This enables us to further establish that having a uniform H\"olderian error bound with exponent 1/2 is a generic property for a class of feasibility problems involving these cones.</description>

      <title>Gain-Scheduled Data-Enabled Predictive Control: A DeePC Approach for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control is a well established control technology for trajectory tracking. Its use requires the availability of an accurate model of the plant, but obtaining such a model is often time consuming and costly. Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) addresses this shortcoming in the linear time-invariant setting, by skipping the model building step and instead relying directly on input-output data. Unfortunately, many real systems are nonlinear and exhibit strong operating-point dependence. Building on classical linear parameter-varying control, we introduce DeePC-GS, a gain-scheduled extension of DeePC for unknown, regime-varying systems. The key idea is to allow DeePC to switch between different local Hankel matrices -- selected online via a measurable scheduling variable -- thereby uniting classical gain scheduling tools with identification-free, data-driven MPC. We test the effectiveness of our DeePC-GS formulation on a nonlinear ship-steering benchmark, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven MPC while maintaining tractable computation.</description>

      <title>ORACLE: A rigorous metric and method to explore all near-optimal designs for energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization models are fundamental tools for providing quantitative insights to decision-makers. However, models, objectives, and constraints do not capture all real-world factors accurately. Thus, instead of the single optimal solution, real-world stakeholders are often interested in the near-optimal space -- solutions that lie within a specified margin of the optimal objective value. Solutions in the near-optimal space can then be assessed regarding desirable non-modeled or qualitative aspects. The near-optimal space is usually explored by so-called Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) methods. However, current MGA approaches mainly employ heuristics, which do not measure or guarantee convergence.
  We propose a method called ORACLE, which guarantees generation and exploration on the \emph{entire near-optimal} space by exploiting convexity. ORACLE iteratively approximates the near-optimal space by introducing a metric that both measures convergence and suggests exploration directions. Once the approximations are refined to a desired tolerance, any near-optimal designs can be generated with negligible computational effort.
  We compare our approach with existing methods on a sector-coupled energy system model of Switzerland. ORACLE is the only method able to guarantee convergence within a desired tolerance. Additionally, we show that heuristic MGA methods miss large areas of the near-optimal space, potentially skewing decision-making by leaving viable options for the energy transition off the table.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization Algorithm for Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programs with Trigonometric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the first mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based iterative algorithm to solve factorable mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) with bounded, differentiable periodic functions to global optimality with an emphasis on trigonometric functions. At each iteration, the algorithm solves a MILP relaxation of the original MINLP to obtain a bound on the optimal objective value. The relaxations are constructed using partitions of variables involved in each nonlinear term and across successive iterations, the solution of the relaxations is used to refine these partitions further leading to tighter relaxations. Also, at each iteration, a heuristic/local solve on the MINLP is used to obtain a feasible solution to the MINLP. The iterative algorithm terminates till the optimality gap is sufficiently small. This article proposes novel refinement strategies that first choose a subset of variables whose domain is refined, refinement schemes that specify the manner in which the variable domains are refined, and MILP relaxations that exploit the principal domain of the periodic functions. We also show how solving the resulting MILP relaxation may be accelerated when two or more periodic functions are related by a linking constraint. This is especially useful as any periodic function may be approximated to arbitrary precision by a Fourier series. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach by solving a path planning problem for a single fixed-wing aerial vehicle and present extensive numerical results comparing the various refinement schemes and techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimal Matching Strategies in Two-sided Markets: A Mean Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a mean field game framework for dynamic two-sided matching markets, extending existing matching theory by integrating micro-macro dynamics in two-sided environments. Unlike traditional matching models focusing on static equilibrium or unilateral optimization, our framework simultaneously captures dynamic interactions and strategic behaviors of both market sides, as well as the equilibrium. We model two types of agents who meet each other via Poisson processes and make simultaneous matching decisions to maximize their respective objective functionals, and find the corresponding equilibrium. Our approach formulates the equilibrium as a fully coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck system with nonlocal structure coupling two distinct populations. The mathematical analysis addresses significant challenges from the dual-layered coupling structure and nonlocal structure. We also provide insights into individual behaviors shaping aggregate patterns in labor markets through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Trajectory Bundle Method: Unifying Sequential-Convex Programming and Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving trajectory optimization problems in a derivative-free manner through the use of sequential convex programming. Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</description>

      <title>Profit Maximization for a Robotics-as-a-Service Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) presents new operational challenges, particularly in optimizing business decisions like pricing and equipment management. While much research focuses on the technical aspects of RaaS, the strategic business problems of joint pricing and replacement have been less explored. This paper addresses the problem of profit maximization for an RaaS operator operating a single robot at a time. We formulate a model where jobs arrive sequentially, and for each, the provider must decide on a price, which the customer can accept or reject. Upon job completion, the robot undergoes stochastic degradation, increasing its probability of failure in future tasks. The operator must then decide whether to replace the robot, balancing replacement costs against future revenue potential and holding costs. To solve this complex sequential decision-making problem, we develop a framework that integrates data-driven estimation techniques inspired by survival analysis and inverse optimization to learn models of customer behavior and robot failure. These models are used within a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to compute an optimal policy for joint pricing and replacement. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in maximizing profit by adaptively managing pricing and robot lifecycle decisions.</description>

      <title>Integrated Forecasting of Marine Renewable Power: An Adaptively Bayesian-Optimized MVMD-LSTM Framework for Wind-Solar-Wave Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs, thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source, insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies, struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system. Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive-Serve-Longest Control for Multi-robot Scheduling Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.</description>

      <title>Modular Design of Strict Control Lyapunov Functions for Global Stabilization of the Unicycle in Polar Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that, unlike in Cartesian form where Brockett's condition rules out static feedback stabilization, the unicycle is globally asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback in polar coordinates. In this note, we introduce a modular framework for designing smooth feedback laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization in polar coordinates. These laws are bidirectional, enabling efficient parking maneuvers, and are paired with families of strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) constructed in a modular fashion. The resulting CLFs guarantee global asymptotic stability with explicit convergence rates and include barrier variants that yield "almost global" stabilization, excluding only zero-measure subsets of the rotation manifolds. The strictness of the CLFs is further leveraged in our companion paper, where we develop inverse-optimal redesigns with meaningful cost functions and infinite gain margins.</description>

      <title>Integrator Forwading Design for Unicycles with Constant and Actuated Velocity in Polar Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a companion paper, we present a modular framework for unicycle stabilization in polar coordinates that provides smooth steering laws through backstepping. Surprisingly, the same problem also allows the application of integrator forwarding. In this work, we leverage this feature and construct new smooth steering laws together with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), expanding the set of CLFs available for inverse optimal control design. In the case of constant forward velocity (Dubins car), backstepping produces finite-time (deadbeat) parking, and we show that integrator forwarding yields the very same class of solutions. This reveals a fundamental connection between backstepping and forwarding in addressing both the unicycle and, the Dubins car parking problems.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Type Control Problems Driven by Jump-diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply a probabilistic approach to study general mean field type control (MFTC) problems with jump-diffusions, and give the first global-in-time solution. We allow the drift coefficient $b$ and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ to nonlinearly depend on the state, distribution and control variables, and both can be unbounded and possibly degenerate; besides, the jump coefficient $\gamma$ is allowed to be non-constant. To tackle the non-linear and control-dependent diffusion $\sigma$, we further formulate a joint cone property and estimates for both processes $P$ and $Q$ of the corresponding adjoint process (where $(P,Q,R)$ is the solution triple of the associated adjoint process as a backward stochastic differential equation with jump), in contrast to our previous single cone property of the only process $P$. We study first the system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps arising from the maximum principle, and then the related Jacobian flows, which altogether yield the classical regularity of the value function and thus allow us to show that the value function is the unique classical solution of the HJB integro-partial differential equation. Most importantly, our proposed probabilistic approach can apparently handle the MFTC problem driven by a fairly general process far beyond Brownian motion, in a relatively easier manner than the existing analytic approach.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of Minima in Deep Matrix Factorization: Exact Expressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff &amp; Michaeli (2020). To complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.</description>

      <title>EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

      <description>arXiv:2509.26337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle (LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning. We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately. Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the state-of-the-art federated learning methods.</description>

      <title>Real-time Velocity Profile Optimization for Time-Optimal Maneuvering with Generic Acceleration Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths, subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However, the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FB_public_RAL.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Robbins-Siegmund Theorem with Applications in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first $L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.</description>

      <title>On some perturbation properties of nonsmooth optimization on Riemannian manifolds with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a perturbation analysis framework for nonsmooth optimization on connected Riemannian manifolds to bridge the gap between the rapid development of algorithmic approaches and a robust theoretical foundation. Using tangent-space local models, we transport core notions from Euclidean variational analysis, such as strong regularity, the Aubin property, and isolated calmness of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution mapping, to the manifold setting. Furthermore, we introduce the manifold (strong) variational sufficiency and show that its strong version is intrinsic, i.e., independent of the chosen retraction, and for polyhedral, second-order cone, and semidefinite programs, it coincides with the manifold strong second-order sufficient condition. These insights yield concrete algorithmic consequences. We show that the Riemannian Sequential Quadratic Programming achieves local superlinear and, under mild additional assumptions, quadratic convergence without strict complementarity, while the Riemannian Augmented Lagrangian Method attains R-linear convergence even when Lagrange multipliers are nonunique. Moreover, the proposed condition guarantees positive definiteness of the generalized Hessians associated with the augmented Lagrangian, enabling superlinear semismooth Newton steps in inner solves. Numerical experiments on robust matrix completion and compressed modes validate the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A scalable optimization approach for equitable facility location: Methodology and transportation applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and equitable access to essential services, such as healthcare, food, and education, is an important goal in urban planning, public policy, and transport logistics. However, existing facility location models often do not scale well to large instances, or primarily focus on optimizing average accessibility, neglecting equity concerns, particularly for disadvantaged populations. This paper proposes a novel, scalable framework for equitable facility location, introducing a linearized proxy for the Kolm-Pollak Equally-Distributed Equivalent (EDE) metric to balance efficiency and fairness. Computational experiments demonstrate that our approach scales to extremely large problem instances, while being sensitive enough to account for inequity throughout the distribution, not merely via the maximum value. Moreover, optimal solutions represent significant improvements for the worst-off residents in terms of distance to an open amenity, while also attaining a near-optimal average experience for all users. An extensive real-world case study on supermarket access illustrates the practical applicability of the framework, with additional examples coming from polling applications. As such, the model is extended to handle real-world considerations such as capacity constraints, split demand assignments, and location-specific penalties. By bridging the gap between equity theory and practical optimization, this work offers a robust and versatile tool for researchers and practitioners in urban planning, transportation, and public policy.</description>

      <title>Extended Set Difference : Inverse Operation of Minkowski Summation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19779v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the extended set difference, a generalization of the Hukuhara and generalized Hukuhara differences, defined for compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The proposed difference guarantees existence for any pair of such sets, offering a broader framework for set arithmetic. The difference may not be necessarily unique, but we offer a bound on the variety of solutions. The definition of the extended set difference is formulated through an optimization problem, which provides a constructive approach to its computation. The paper explores the properties of this new difference, including its stability under orthogonal transformations and its robustness to perturbations of the input sets. We propose a method to compute this difference through a formulated linear optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imposing additional constraints on low-rank optimization has garnered growing interest. However, the geometry of coupled constraints hampers the well-developed low-rank structure and makes the problem intricate. To this end, we propose a space-decoupling framework for optimization on bounded-rank matrices with orthogonally invariant constraints. The "space-decoupling" is reflected in several ways. We show that the tangent cone of coupled constraints is the intersection of tangent cones of each constraint. Moreover, we decouple the intertwined bounded-rank and orthogonally invariant constraints into two spaces, leading to optimization on a smooth manifold. Implementing Riemannian algorithms on this manifold is painless as long as the geometry of additional constraints is known. In addition, we unveil the equivalence between the reformulated problem and the original problem. Numerical experiments on real-world applications -- spherical data fitting, graph similarity measuring, low-rank SDP, model reduction of Markov processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning -- validate the superiority of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Globally Convergent Method for Computing B-stationary Points of Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a computationally efficient method that globally converges to B-stationary points of mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) in a finite number of iterations. B-stationarity is necessary for optimality and means that no feasible first-order direction can improve the objective. Given a feasible point of an MPEC, B-stationarity can be certified by solving a linear program with equilibrium constraints (LPCC) constructed at this point. The proposed method solves a sequence of LPCCs, which either certify B-stationarity or provide an active-set estimate for the complementarity constraints, along with nonlinear programs (NLPs) -- referred to as branch NLPs (BNLPs) -- obtained by fixing the active set in the MPEC. A BNLP is more regular than the original MPEC, easier to solve, and with the correct active set, its solution coincides with that of the MPEC. We show that, unless the current iterate is B-stationary, these combinatorial LPCCs need not be solved to optimality; for convergence, it suffices to compute a nonzero feasible point, yielding significant computational savings. The method proceeds in two phases: the first identifies a feasible BNLP or a {stationary point of a constraint infeasibility minimization problem, and the second solves a finite sequence of BNLPs until a B-stationary point of the MPEC is found. We established finite convergence under the MPEC-MFCQ. Numerical experiments and an open-source software implementation show that the proposed method is more robust and faster than relaxation-based and mixed-integer NLP approaches, even on medium to large-scale instances.</description>

      <title>Optimized dynamic scheduling of an exclusive bus lane or high occupancy vehicle lane in a bimodal traffic corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient management of traffic corridors is critical for sustaining urban mobility. Exclusive bus lane (EBL) and high occupancy vehicle lane (HOVL) are two prominent strategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes for faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies may underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic implementation, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize road efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study first compares the mixed traffic policy (MTP), exclusive bus lane policy (EBLP), and high occupancy vehicle lane policy (HOVLP) by formulating the total system costs in the context of a bimodal traffic corridor involving private cars and public buses. Under each lane policy, the bus frequency is optimized together with the modal split equilibrium derived separately. Based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process, switching thresholds are then derived to identify optimal periods for implementing each policy. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the proposed dynamic policy schedules. Compared to static implementations, the dynamic policy schedules achieve cost reductions of 11.9%, 6.70%, and 43.64% relative to MTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in two real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations in Seattle, the proposed dynamic policy reduces total costs by 32.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a robust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL policies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting implicit variables in mathematical optimization: simplified modeling and a numerical evidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit variables of an optimization problem are used to model variationally challenging feasibility conditions in a tractable way while not entering the objective function. Hence, it is a standard approach to treat implicit variables as explicit ones. Recently, it has been shown in terms of a comparatively complex model problem that this approach, generally, is theoretically disadvantageous as the surrogate problem typically suffers from the presence of artificial stationary points and the need for stronger constraint qualifications. The purpose of the present paper is twofold. First, it introduces a much simpler and easier accessible model problem which can be used to recapitulate and even broaden the aforementioned findings. Indeed, we will extend the analysis to two more classes of stationary points and the associated constraint qualifications. These theoretical results are accompanied by illustrative examples from cardinality-constrained, vanishing-constrained, and bilevel optimization. Second, the present paper illustrates, in terms of cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization problems, that treating implicit variables as explicit ones may also be disadvantageous from a numerical point of view.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Preconditioning into Accelerated Approaches: Theoretical Guarantees and Practical Improvement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning are widely researched fields that provide solutions to many modern problems. Due to the complexity of new problems related to the size of datasets, efficient approaches are obligatory. In optimization theory, the Heavy Ball and Nesterov methods use \textit{momentum} in their updates of model weights. On the other hand, the minimization problems considered may be poorly conditioned, which affects the applicability and effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques. One solution to this issue is \textit{preconditioning}, which has already been investigated in approaches such as \textsc{AdaGrad}, \textsc{RMSProp}, \textsc{Adam} and others. Despite this, momentum acceleration and preconditioning have not been fully explored together. Therefore, we propose the Preconditioned Heavy Ball (\textsc{PHB}) and Preconditioned Nesterov method (\textsc{PN}) with theoretical guarantees of convergence under \textit{unified} assumption on the scaling matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical experiments that demonstrate superior performance compared to the unscaled techniques in terms of iteration and oracle complexities.</description>

      <title>Warm-starting outer approximation for parametrized convex MINLP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of efficiently solving parameterized sequences of convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems through warm-starting techniques. We focus on an outer approximation (OA) approach, for which we develop the theoretical foundation and present two warm-starting techniques for solving sequences of convex MINLPs. These types of problem sequences arise in several important applications, such as, multiobjective MINLPs using scalarization techniques, sparse linear regression, hybrid model predictive control, or simply in analyzing the impact of certain problem parameters.
  The main contribution of this paper is the mathematical analysis of the proposed warm-starting framework for OA-based algorithms, which shows that a simple adaptation of the polyhedral outer approximation from one problem to the next can greatly improve the computational performance. We prove that, under some conditions, one of the proposed warm-starting techniques result in only one OA iteration to find an optimal solution and verify optimality. Numerical results demonstrate noticeable performance improvements compared to two common initialization approaches, and show that the warm-starting can also in practice result in a single iteration to converge for several problems in the sequences. Our methods are especially effective for problems where consecutive problems in the sequence are similar, and where the integer part of the optimal solutions are constant for several problems in the sequence. The results show that it is possible, both in theory and practice, to perform warm-starting to significantly enhance the computational efficiency of solving parameterized convex MINLPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an irreversible investment problem under incomplete information, where the investor decides whether and when to make investments in a project. Upon investment, the investor acquires previously hidden information from the project's past (''learning from the past''), and so the learning rate of the problem is controlled by investing. We set up this original problem as an recursively defined stopping problem, where the learning rate is accelerated after each recursion step. To solve the problem, we show that at each step, there indeed exists a one-sided stopping boundary under general conditions. We proceed to present the optimal investment strategy as a sequence of semi-explicit stopping boundaries derived from smooth fit conditions. Feasibility of our approach is then demonstrated by solving boundaries numerically and by illustrating comparative statistics.</description>

      <title>A Two-fold Randomization Framework for Impulse Control Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a randomization scheme for a general class of impulse control problems. The solution to this randomized problem is characterized as the fixed point of a compound operator which consists of a regularized nonlocal operator and a regularized stopping operator. This approach allows us to derive a semi-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Through an equivalent randomization scheme with a Poisson compound measure, we establish a verification theorem that implies the uniqueness of the solution. Via an iterative approach, we prove the existence of the solution. The existence-and-uniqueness result ensures the randomized problem is well-defined. We then demonstrate that our randomized impulse control problem converges to its classical counterpart as the randomization parameter $\pmb \lambda$ vanishes. This convergence, combined with the value function's $C^{2,\alpha}_{loc}$ regularity, confirms our framework provides a robust approximation and a foundation for developing learning algorithms. Under this framework, we propose an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Its policy improvement step is naturally derived from the iterative approach from the existence proof, which enjoys a geometric convergence rate. We implement a model-free version of the algorithm and numerically demonstrate its effectiveness using a widely-studied example. The results show that our RL algorithm can learn the randomized solution, which accurately approximates its classical counterpart. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the volatility parameter $\sigma$ in the state process effectively demonstrates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Ringleader ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity under Data Heterogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asynchronous stochastic gradient methods are central to scalable distributed optimization, particularly when devices differ in computational capabilities. Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions. However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of asynchronous optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) is widely used in reinforcement learning due to its scalability and good performance. In recent years, several variance-reduced PG methods have been proposed with a theoretical guarantee of converging to an approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP) with the sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. However, FOSPs could be bad local optima or saddle points. Moreover, these algorithms often use importance sampling (IS) weights which could impair the statistical effectiveness of variance reduction. In this paper, we propose a variance-reduced second-order method that uses second-order information in the form of Hessian vector products (HVP) and converges to an approximate second-order stationary point (SOSP) with sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. This rate improves the best-known sample complexity for achieving approximate SOSPs by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-0.5})$. Moreover, the proposed variance reduction technique bypasses IS weights by using HVP terms. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art and is more robust to changes in random seeds.</description>

Abstract: We show that buoyancy driven flows can be steered in an arbitrary time towards any state by applying as control only an external temperature profile in a subset of small measure. More specifically, we prove that the 2D incompressible Boussinesq system on the torus is globally approximately controllable via physically localized heating or cooling. In addition, our controls have an explicitly prescribed structure; even without such structural requirements, large data controllability results for Boussinesq flows driven merely by a physically localized temperature profile were so far unknown. The presented method exploits various connections between the model's underlying transport-, coupling-, and scaling mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We present new convergence analyses for parallel subspace correction methods for unconstrained semicoercive and nearly semicoercive convex optimization problems, generalizing the theory of singular and nearly singular linear problems to a class of nonlinear problems. Our results demonstrate that the elegant theoretical framework developed for singular and nearly singular linear problems can be extended to unconstrained semicoercive and nearly semicoercive convex optimization problems. For semicoercive problems, we show that the convergence rate can be estimated in terms of a seminorm stable decomposition over the subspaces and the kernel of the problem, aligning with the theory for singular linear problems. For nearly semicoercive problems, we establish a parameter-independent convergence rate, assuming the kernel of the semicoercive part can be decomposed into a sum of local kernels, which aligns with the theory for nearly singular problems. To demonstrate the applicability of our results, we provide convergence analyses of two-level additive Schwarz methods for solving certain nonlinear partial differential equations with Neumann boundary conditions, within the proposed abstract framework.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Estimation of Structured Singular Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the size of the modeling error is crucial for robust control. Over the years, numerous metrics have been developed to quantify the model error in a control relevant manner. One of the most important such metrics is the structured singular value, as it leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring stability and robustness in feedback control under structured model uncertainty. Although the computation of the structured singular value is often intractable, lower and upper bounds for it can often be obtained if a model of the system is known. In this paper, we introduce a fully data-driven method to estimate a lower bound for the structured singular value, by conducting experiments on the system and applying power iterations to the collected data. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this method effectively lower bounds the structured singular value, yielding results comparable to the MATLAB$^\copyright$ Robust Control Toolbox.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Controllability of Boussinesq flows driven by finite-dimensional and physically localized forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show approximate controllability of Boussinesq flows in $\mathbb{T}^2 = \mathbb{R}^2 / 2\pi\mathbb{Z}^2$ driven by finite-dimensional controls that are supported in any fixed region $\omega \subset \mathbb{T}^2$. This addresses a Boussinesq version of a question by Agrachev and provides the first known example of incompressible fluids with this property. In this context, we complement results obtained for the Navier--Stokes system by Agrachev--Sarychev (Comm. Math. Phys. 265, 2006), where the controls are finite-dimensional but not localized in physical space, and Nersesyan--Rissel (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78, 2025), where physically localized controls admit for special $\omega$ a degenerate but not finite-dimensional structure.
  For our proof, we study controllability properties of tailored convection equations governed by time-periodic degenerately forced Euler flows that provide a twofold geometric mechanism: transport of information through $\omega$ versus non-stationary mixing effects transferring energy from low-dimensional sources to higher frequencies. The temperature is then controlled by using Coron's return method, while the velocity is mainly driven by the buoyant force.
  When $\omega$ contains two cuts of $\mathbb{T}^2$, our approach allows to effectively construct low-dimensional control spaces of dimensions that are independent of the choice of $\omega$ within this class of control regions.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Analysis and Control of Epidemic Spreading over Networks using Dissipativity and Mesh Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances, complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing several existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Orbits and attainable Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of mechanical Liouville equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the approximate controllability problem for Liouville transport equations along a mechanical Hamiltonian vector field. Such PDEs evolve inside the orbit $$\mathcal{O}(\rho_0):=\left\{\rho_0\circ \Phi\mid \Phi\in {\rm DHam}(T^*M)\right\},\quad \rho_0\in L^r(T^*M,\mathbb{R}), \quad r\in[1,\infty),$$ where $\rho_0$ is the initial density and ${\rm DHam}(T^*M)$ is the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle manifold $T^*M$. The approximately reachable densities from $\rho_0$ are thus contained in $\overline{\mathcal{O}(\rho_0)}$, where the closure is taken with respect to the $L^r$-topology. Our first result is a characterization of $\overline{\mathcal{O}(\rho_0)}$ when the manifold $M$ is the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ or the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ of arbitrary dimension: $\overline{\mathcal{O}(\rho_0)}$ is the set of all the densities whose sub- and super-level sets have the same measure as those of $\rho_0$. This result is an approximate version, in the case of ${\rm DHam}(T^*M)$, of a theorem by J. Moser (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 120: 286-294, 1965) on the group of diffeomorphisms.
  We then present two examples of systems, respectively on $M=\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$, where the small-time approximately attainable diffeomorphisms coincide with ${\rm DHam}(T^*M)$, respectively at the level of the group and at the level of the densities.
  The proofs are based on the construction of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms that approximate suitable permutations of finite grids, and Poisson bracket techniques.</description>
