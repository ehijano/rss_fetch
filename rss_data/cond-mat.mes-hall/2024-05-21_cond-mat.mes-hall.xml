      <title>Research on the Quantum confinement of Carriers in the Type-I Quantum Wells Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum confinement is recognized to be an inherent property in low-dimensional structures. Traditionally it is believed that the carriers trapped within the well cannot escape due to the discrete energy levels. However, our previous research has revealed efficient carrier escape in low-dimensional structures, contradicting this conventional understanding. In this study, we review the energy band structure of quantum wells considering it as a superposition of the bulk material dispersion and quantization energy dispersion resulting from the quantum confinement across the whole Brillouin zone. By accounting for all wave vectors, we obtain a certain distribution of carrier energy at each quantization energy level, giving rise to the energy subbands. These results enable carriers to escape from the well under the influence of an electric field. Additionally, we have compiled a comprehensive summary of various energy band scenarios in quantum well structures, relevant to carrier transport. Such a new interpretation holds significant value in deepening our comprehension of low-dimensional energy bands, discovering new physical phenomena, and designing novel devices with superior performance.</description>

      <title>Localization and conductance in fractional quantum Hall edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect gives rise to abundant topological phases, presenting an ultimate platform for studying the transport of edge states. Generic FQH edge contains multiple edge modes, commonly including the counter-propagating ones. A question of the influence of Anderson localization on transport through such edges arises. Recent experimental advances in engineering novel devices with interfaces of different FQH states enable transport measurements of FQH edges and edge junctions also featuring counter-propagating modes. These developments provide an additional strong motivation for the theoretical study of the effects of localization on generic edge states. We develop a general framework for analyzing transport in various regimes that also naturally includes localization. Using a reduced field theory of the edge after localization, we derive a general formula for the conductance. We apply this framework to analyze various experimentally relevant geometries of FQH edges and edge junctions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing moir\'e ferroelectricity to modulate semiconductor monolayer light emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity has been recently discovered in stacked or twisted van der Waals (vdW) moir\'e systems. The versatility of producing a large array of size-tunable domains and integration with diverse functional materials make them an enticing platform for developing multifunctional devices. Here, we show that ferroelectric polar domains formed in a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN) substrate can modulate light emission from an adjacent semiconductor monolayer. The abrupt change in electrostatic potential across the domains produces an in-plane electric field (E-field) and leads to a remarkably large exciton Stark shift in the adjacent MoSe$_2$ monolayer, previously only observable in \textit{p-n} junctions created by the advanced e-beam lithography tools. Both the spectrum and spatial pattern of the light emission from the monolayer are periodically modulated by the remote moir\'e potential imposed by the t-hBN substrate. We further observe a characteristic hysteresis behavior in the light emission as an electric gate erases and restores the domains. Our findings chart an exciting pathway for integrating nanometer-scale moir\'e ferroelectric domains with various optically active functional layers, paving the way for advanced nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling Induced Topological Phase Transition to Higher Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically find that the second-order topological insulator, i.e., corner states, can be engineered by coupling two copies of two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators with opposite spin-helicities. As concrete examples, we utilize Kane-Mele models (i.e., graphene with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling) to realize the corner states by setting the respective graphenes to be $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators with opposite intrinsic spin-orbit couplings. To exhibit its universality, we generalize our findings to other representative $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators, e.g., the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. An effective model is presented to reveal the physical origin of corner states. We further show that the corner states can also be designed in other topological systems, e.g., by coupling quantum anomalous Hall systems with opposite Chern numbers. Our work suggests that interlayer coupling can be treated as a simple and efficient strategy to drive lower-order topological insulators to the higher-order ones.</description>

      <title>Different driving protocols and multiple Majorana modes in a Rashba coupled superconducting nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform systematic analyses of single and multi-frequency driving protocols on a Rashba nanowire with superconducting correlations induced by proximity effects. The results for the single-mode drive reveal interesting frequency dependencies of the Majorana modes, in the sense that the parameters corresponding to the trivial and topological limits of the undriven (static) case host Majorana zero modes, respectively at low and high frequencies. Further, emergence of long-range interactions are noted that give rise to multiple gap-closing scenarios, which imply occurrence of multiple Majorana modes. On the other hand, the multi-frequency driving protocol, sub-grouped into commensurate and incommensurate ratios of the frequencies, demonstrates intriguing consequences. The commensurate case yields dynamical control over the stability of the edge modes. Moreover, complex driving protocols harm the Majoranas by pushing them into the bulk. Finally, the incommensurate case yields independent Majorana modes occurring at low-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. While the single and the commensurate multi-frequency driving protocols admit the usage of symmetric time frames for the computation of the topological invariants, the incommensurate case relies on the framework of many-mode Floquet theory, where the topological properties are ascertained via calculating the Berry phase. We present band structure and phase diagrams to substantiate all our results. The robustness and concurrent existence of these unique Majorana modes, even amidst a very dense energy spectrum along with a lack of global time-periodicity, hold promise for applications in quantum computing and the development of Floquet time crystals.</description>

      <title>High-yield fabrication of bubble-free magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene devices with high twist-angle homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) stands as one of the most versatile materials in condensed-matter physics due to its hosting of a wide variety of exotic phases while also offering convenient tunability. However, the fabrication of MATBG is still manual, and remains to be a challenging and inefficient process, with devices being highly dependent on specific fabrication methods, that often result in inconsistency and variability. In this work, we present an optimized protocol for the fabrication of MATBG samples, for which we use deterministic graphene anchoring to stabilize the twist-angle, and a careful bubble removal techniques to ensure a high twist-angle homogeneity. We use low-temperature transport experiments to extract the average twist-angle between pairs of leads. We find that up to 38 percent of the so fabricated devices show micrometer square sized regions with a twist-angle in the range 1.1 plus/minus 0.1 degrees, and a twist-angle variation of only 0.02 degrees, where in some instances such regions were up to 36 micrometer square large. We are certain that the discussed protocols can be directly transferred to non-graphene materials, and will be useful for the growing field of moire materials.</description>

      <title>Generic Approach to Intrinsic Magnetic Second-order Topological Insulators via Inverted $p-d$ Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of intrinsically magnetic and topologically nontrivial two-dimensional materials holds tantalizing prospects for the exotic quantum anomalous Hall insulators and magnetic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs). Compared with the well-studied nonmagnetic counterparts, the pursuit of intrinsic magnetic SOTIs remains limited. In this work, we address this gap by focusing on $p-d$ orbitals inversion, a fundamental but often overlooked phenomena in the construction of topological materials. We begin by developing a theoretical framework to elucidate $p-d$ orbitals inversion through a combined density-functional theory calculation and Wannier downfolding. Subsequently we showcase the generality of this concept in realizing ferromagnetism SOTIs by identifying two real materials with distinct lattices: 1$T$-VS$_2$ in a hexagonal lattice, and CrAs monolayer in a square lattice. We further compare it with other mechanisms requiring spin-orbit coupling and explore the similarities to topological Kondo insulators. Our findings establish a generic pathway towards intrinsic magnetic SOTIs.</description>

      <title>Inelastic electron-light scattering at dielectric thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recently developed methodology termed photon induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), the inelastic scattering of electrons off illuminated nanostructures provides direct experimental access to the structure of optical near-field modes and their population. Whereas the inelastic scattering probability can be quantitatively linked to the near field distribution, analytical results for simple light scattering geometries are scarce. Here we derive a fully analytical expression for the coupling strength between free electrons and optical near-fields in planar geometries representing dielectric thin films. Contributions to the overall coupling from the electric field above, below and within the sample are analyzed in detail. By carefully choosing the relative angles between electron beam, light and thin film and by accounting for a broad spectrum of photon energies, we demonstrate that one can imprint optical material properties like the reflectivity onto the electron energy distribution.</description>

      <title>Time depending magnetization of nanoparticles under radiofrequency fields: relaxation time in water for solid-liquid transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In application as hyperthermia and nanowarming, power dissipation arises when the time-dependent magnetization $M(t)$ of an out-of-equilibrium system of nanoparticles lags behind the applied field $H(t)$. The key parameter governing this process is the relaxation time $\tau$ of the system, which induces a phase shift $\phi_n$ between $H(t)$ and every nth harmonic component of $M(t)$. In this work, we present an expression for $M(t)$ in terms of $\tau$ and the equilibrium magnetization, valid for any magnetic system exhibiting odd equilibrium response. From this calculation, we obtain a method for determining the effective $\tau$ of a MNPs sample directly from the experimental measurement of $M(t)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the power dissipation (SAR: Specific Absorption Rate) of any magnetic sample under a sinusoidal field can be obtained from the first harmonic component of $M(t)$. As an illustrative application, we explore the variation of $\tau$ for magnetic MNPs in aqueous suspension during the melting process of the matrix. In this case, the change in $\tau$ can be understood as a result of the reorientation of the MNPs in the direction of the applied field as the matrix becomes liquid.</description>

      <title>Strongly coupled magneto-exciton condensates in large-angle twisted double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, the bosonic quasiparticle emerging from Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes, will undergo a Bose-Einstein condensation(BEC) and transition into a superfluid state with global phase coherence at low temperatures. An important platform to study such excitonic physics is built on double-layer quantum wells or recent two-dimensional material heterostructures, where two parallel planes of electrons and holes are separated by a thin insulating layer. Lowering this separation distance ($d$) enhances the interlayer Coulomb interaction thereby strengthens the exciton binding energy. However, an exceedingly small $d$ will lead to the undesired interlayer tunneling, which results the annihilation of excitons. Here, we report the observation of a sequences of robust exciton condensates(ECs) in double bilayer graphenes twisted to $\sim 10^\circ$ with no insulating mid-layer. The large momentum mismatch between the two graphene layers well suppress the interlayer tunneling, allowing us to reach the separation lower limit $\sim$ 0.334 nm and investigate ECs in the extreme coupling regime. Carrying out transport measurements on the bulk and edge of the devices, we find incompressible states corresponding to ECs when both layers are half-filled in the $N=0$ and $N=1$ Landau levels (LLs). The comparison between these ECs and theoretical calculations suggest that the low-energy charged excitation of ECs can be meron-antimeron or particle-hole pair, which relies on both LL index and carrier type. Our results establish large-angle twisted bilayers as an experimental platform with extreme coupling strength for studying quantum bosonic phase and its low-energy excitations.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Braiding Topology of Non-Hermitian Open-Boundary Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest and progress on topological structures of the non-Hermitian Bloch bands. Here, we study the topological structures of non-Bloch bands of non-Hermitian multi-band quantum systems under open boundary conditions. Using a continuity criterion and an efficient sub-GBZ algorithm, we establish a homotopic characterization -- braiding topology, e.g., characterized by the band's total vorticity -- for open-boundary bands and sub-GBZs. Such topological identification is robust without topological transition and emergent degenerate points, such as exceptional points. We further analyze the transition's impact on bands and spectral flows, including interesting properties unique to open boundaries, and numerically demonstrate our conclusions with tight-binding model examples. Our results enrich our foundational understanding of topological characterizations for generic non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of giant orbital Hall and tunable spin Hall effects in centrosymmetric TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of orbital and spin Hall effects (OHE/SHE) in the 1T phase of non-magnetic transition metal dichalcogenides. With the aid of density functional theory calculations and model Hamiltonian studies on MX$_2$ (M = Pt, Pd and X = S, Se, and Te), we show an intrinsic orbital Hall conductivity ($\sim 10^3 \hbar /e\ \Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$) , which primarily emerges due to the orbital texture around the valleys in the momentum space. The robust spin-orbit coupling in these systems induces a sizable SHE out of OHE. Furthermore, to resemble the typical experimental setups, where the magnetic overlayers produce a proximity magnetic field, we examine the effect of magnetic field on OHE and SHE and showed that the latter can be doubled in these class of compounds. With a giant OHE and tunable SHE, the 1T-TMDs are promising candidates for spin and orbital driven quantum devices such as SOT-MRAM, spin nano-oscillators, spin logic devices etc., and to carry out spin-charge conversion experiments for fundamental research.</description>

      <title>Tunable moir\'e bandgap in hBN-aligned bilayer graphene device with in-situ electrostatic gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, great efforts have been devoted in introducing a sizable and tunable band gap in graphene for its potential application in next-generation electronic devices. The primary challenge in modulating this gap has been the absence of a direct method for observing changes of the band gap in momentum space. In this study, we employ advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moir\'e potentials. The application of displacement field via in-situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moir\'e potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ~ 20 meV. Theoretical calculations, effectively capture the experimental observations. Our investigation provides a quantitative understanding of how these two mechanisms collaboratively modulate the band gap in bilayer graphene, offering valuable guidance for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Carrier Relaxation Dynamics in a Nodal-Line Semimetal PtSn$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Dirac nodal-line semimetals host topologically nontrivial electronic structure with nodal-line crossings around the Fermi level, which could affect the photocarrier dynamics and lead to novel relaxation mechanisms. Herein, by using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the previously-inaccessible linear dispersions of the bulk conduction bands above the Fermi level in a Dirac nodal-line semimetal PtSn$_4$, as well as the momentum and temporal evolution of the gapless nodal lines. A surprisingly ultrafast relaxation dynamics within a few hundred femtoseconds is revealed for photoexcited carriers in the nodal line. Theoretical calculations suggest that such ultrafast carrier relaxation is attributed to the multichannel scatterings among the complex metallic bands of PtSn$_4$ via electron-phonon coupling. In addition, a unique dynamic relaxation mechanism contributed by the highly anisotropic Dirac nodal-line electronic structure is also identified. Our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the ultrafast carrier dynamics in a Dirac nodal-line semimetal.</description>

      <title>Volkov-Pankratov states in a driven semimetal for a generic interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volkov-Pankratov states are the non-topological massive bound states which generally arise across the smooth interface between two adjacent regions of a two-band semimetal, over which a gap parameter changes sign smoothly. In this work, we show that these modes can be engineered even for a generic smooth interface without any sign inversion. We consider a threefold and a twofold topological semimetal in which two adjacent regions are illuminated by light from two different sources with different light parameters (amplitudes, frequency, phase etc). We show that the interface can exhibit a quantum well for a certain parameter regime even without any sign change of the gap term. Such quantum well can host a number of Volkov-Pankratov states. Finally, we discuss the stability of these states against the deformation of the interfacial well and its transport signatures (Ramsauer Townsend effect).</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium orbital edge magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncompensated non-equilibrium orbital magnetization may arise at sample edges in the presence of charge current. The value of the effect scales as the product of the current density and the electron mean free path without any additional smallness. This non-relativistic phenomenon originates in a lack of inversion symmetry of the electron wave functions in a vicinity of sample interfaces. In a conducting layer, where $z$ direction is chosen perpendicular to the surface, and the current flows in $x$ direction, the non-equilibrium orbital magnetization points in $y$ direction. In a top-bottom symmetric layer, the orbital magnetization has an opposite sign near the top and bottom interfaces thus mimicking the symmetry of the spin-Hall effect but can exceed the latter by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in electron microscopy have introduced innovative techniques enabling the inelastic interaction of fast electrons with tightly confined and intense light fields. These techniques, commonly summarized under the term photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy now offer unprecedented capabilities for a precise mapping of the characteristics of optical near-fields with remarkable spatial resolution but their spectral resolution were only scarcely investigated. In this study, we employ a strongly chirped and temporally broadband light pulse to investigate the interaction between free electrons and light at the edge of a MoS2 thin film. Our approach unveils the details of electron-light coupling, revealing a pronounced dependence of the coupling strength on both the position and photon energy. Employing numerical simulations of a simplified model system we identify these modulations to be caused by optical interferences between the incident and reflected field as well as an optical mode guided within the transition metal dichalcogenide film.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of conical intersections to Floquet theory and work out consequences of the underlying spatio-temporal symmetries for a driven two-level system coupled to an ohmic heat bath. We find that on manifolds with constant quasienergy splitting, the mean energies of the Floquet states vary significantly. The stationary populations behave in the same way, which emphasizes the importance of the mean energies for dissipation. Owing to symmetries, the stationary state may be fully mixed even at zero temperature. In the limit of large driving frequency, such full mixture is found in the whole vicinity of the intersection.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a Fibonacci quasicrystal (QC) arrangement of a one-dimensional topological superconductor, such as a magnetic atom chain deposited on a superconducting surface. We uncover a general mutually exclusive competition between the QC properties and the topological superconducting phase with Majorana bound states (MBS): there are no MBS inside the QC gaps and the MBS never behaves as QC subgap states, and likewise, no critical, or winding, QC subgap states exist inside the topological superconducting gaps. Surprisingly, despite this competition, we find that the QC is still highly beneficial for realizing topological superconductivity with MBS. It both leads to additional large nontrivial regions with MBS in parameter space, that are topologically trivial in crystalline systems, and increases the topological gap protecting the MBS. We also find that shorter approximants of the Fibonacci QC display the largest benefits. As a consequence, our results promote QCs, and especially their short approximants, as an appealing platform for improved experimental possibilities to realize MBS as well as generally highlights the fundamental interplay between different topologies.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of electron spin qubit during transfer between two semiconductor quantum dots at low magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron shuttling is one of the currently pursued avenues towards the scalability of semiconductor quantum dot-based spin qubits. We theoretically analyze the dephasing of a spin qubit adiabatically transferred between two tunnel-coupled quantum dots. We focus on the regime where the Zeeman splitting is lower than the tunnel coupling, at which interdot tunneling with spin flip is absent, and analyze the sources of errors in spin-coherent electron transfer for Si- and GaAs-based quantum dots. Apart from the obvious effect of fluctuations in spin splitting in each dot (e.g., due to nuclear Overhauser fields) leading to finite $ T_{2}^{*} $ of the stationary spin qubit, we consider effects activated by detuning sweeps aimed at adiabatic qubit transfer between the dots: failure of charge transfer caused by charge noise and phonons, spin relaxation due to enhancement of spin-orbit mixing of levels, and spin dephasing caused by low- and high-frequency noise coupling to the electron's charge in the presence of differences in Zeeman splittings between the two dots. Our results indicate that achieving coherent transfer of electron spin in a $10\,\mu$m long dot array necessitates a large and uniform tunnel coupling, with a typical value of $ 2t_c \gtrsim 60 \, \mu$eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that driving polar optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where polarization or magnetization oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and is accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation for certain symmetries. We predict its signatures in time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results open the way to realizing tunable density waves in solids on the nanoscale using THz or IR light.</description>

      <title>Sensing Out-of-Equilibrium and Quantum Non-Gaussian environments via induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking on the quantum-probe dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing quantum sensing tools for investigating systems at atomic and nanoscales is crucial for the progress of quantum technologies. While numerous protocols employ quantum probes to extract information from stationary or weakly coupled environments, the challenges intensify at atomic- and nano-scales where the environment is inherently out-of-equilibrium or strongly coupled with the sensor. We here prove that the time-reversal symmetry in the quantum-sensor control dynamics is broken, when partial information is probed from an environment that is out-of-equilibrium with non stationary fluctuations or is described by quantum non-Gaussian, strongly coupled environmental correlations. We exploit this phenomenon as a quantum sensing paradigm with proof-of principle experimental quantum simulations using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This introduces a signal contrast on a qubit-probe that quantifies how far the sensed environment is from equilibrium or its quantum non-Gaussian nature. Protocols are also presented to discern and filter a variety of environmental properties including stationary, non-stationary and non-Gaussian quantum noise fluctuations as a step toward sensing the ubiquitous environments of a quantum-sensor at atomic and nanoscales.</description>

      <title>Imaging Local Effects of Voltage and Boron Doping on Spin Reversal in Antiferromagnetic Magnetoelectric Cr2O3 Thin Films and Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromia (Cr2O3) is a magnetoelectric oxide which permits voltage-control of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, but it suffers technological constraints due to its low Neel Temperature (TN ~307 K) and the need of a symmetry breaking applied magnetic field to achieve reversal of the Neel vector. Recently, boron (B) doping of Cr2O3 films led to an increase TN &gt; 400 K and allowed the realization of voltage magnetic-field free controlled N\'eel vector rotation. Here, we directly image the impact of B doping on the formation of AFM domains in Cr2O3 thin films and elucidate the mechanism of voltage-controlled manipulation of the spin structure using nitrogen vacancy (NV) scanning probe magnetometry. We find a stark reduction and thickness dependence of domain size in B-doped Cr2O3 (B:Cr2O3) films, explained by the increased germ density, likely associated with the B doping. By reconstructing the surface magnetization from the NV stray-field maps, we find a qualitative distinction between the undoped and B-doped Cr2O3 films, manifested by the histogram distribution of the AFM ordering, i.e., 180 degree domains for pure films, and 90 degree domains for B:Cr2O3 films. Additionally, NV imaging of voltage-controlled B-doped Cr2O3 devices corroborate the 90 degeree rotation of the AFM domains observed in magnetotransport measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of non-Markovian systems and memory induced phenomena poses an everlasting challenge for physics. As a paradigmatic example we consider a classical Brownian particle of mass $M$ subjected to an external force and exposed to correlated thermal fluctuations. We show that the recently developed approach to this system, in which its non-Markovian dynamics given by the Generalized Langevin Equation is approximated by its memoryless counterpart but with the effective particle mass $M^* &lt; M$, can be derived within the Markovian embedding technique. Using this method we calculate the first and the second order memory correction to Markovian dynamics of the Brownian particle for the memory kernel represented as the Prony series. The second one lowers the effective mass of the system further and improves precision of the approximation. Our work opens the door for the derivation of higher order memory corrections to Markovian Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermal contribution to current-driven antiferromagnetic-order switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In information technology devices, current-driven state switching is crucial in various disciplines including spintronics, where the contribution of heating to the switching mechanism plays an inevitable role. Recently, current-driven antiferromagnetic order switching has attracted considerable attention due to its implications for next-generation spintronic devices. Although the switching mechanisms can be explained by spin dynamics induced by spin torques, some reports have claimed that demagnetization above the Neel temperature due to Joule heating is critical for switching. Here we present a systematic method and an analytical model to quantify the thermal contribution due to Joule heating in micro-electronic devices, focusing on current-driven octupole switching in the non-collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn. The results consistently show that the critical temperature for switching remains relatively constant above the Neel temperature, while the threshold current density depends on the choice of substrate and the base temperature. In addition, we provide an analytical model to calculate the Joule-heating temperature which quantitatively explains our experimental results. From numerical calculations, we illustrate the reconfiguration of magnetic orders during cooling from a demagnetized state of polycrystalline Mn3Sn. This work not only provides deeper insights into magnetization switching in antiferromagnets, but also a general guideline for evaluating the Joule-heating temperature excursions in micro-electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a non-linear Lindblad master equation to describe the postselection dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation, which continuously interpolates between the Lindblad master equation and the dynamical equation governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Within the framework of the non-linear Lindblad master equation, we study a prototypical model and demonstrate the existence of the postselected skin effect with the distribution of a steady state characterized by the accumulation of particles on one side, as long as some quantum jumping terms are discarded by postselction processes. Moreover, we show that the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy can reflect the different influences from the environment and postselection, and unveil it exhibiting a special distribution with algebraic growth in the short chain and saturation in the long chain induced by the postselected skin effect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perfluorocubane ($C_8F_8$) was successfully synthesized and found to accept and store electrons in its internal cubic cavity to form magnetic moments. However their inter-molecule spin-exchange coupling mechanism is yet to be revealed. In this study, we found the inter-molecule magnetic groundstates of $C_8F_8$ dimer and one-dimensional (1D) chain are tunable from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) by stacking orders and alkaline earth metals intercalation using first-principle calculations. The inter-molecule couplings are dominated by noncovalent halogen $C-F...C_4$ interactions. Stacking orders of dimers can regulate the relative position of the lone pairs and $\sigma-holes$ at the molecular interface and thus the magnetic groundstates. Alkaline earth metals M (M = Na, Mg) intercalations could form $C_4-M-C_4$ bonds and lead to FM direct exchange at the inter-molecule region. An unpaired electron donated by the intercalated atoms or electron doping can result in a local magnetic moment in dimers, exhibiting an on-off switching by the odd-even number of electron filling. Novel electronic properties such as spin gapless semiconductor and charge density wave (CDW) states emerge when $C_8F_8$ molecules self-assemble with intercalated atoms to form 1D chains. These findings manifest the roles of stacking and intercalation in modifying intermolecular magnetism and the revealed halogen bond-dominated exchange mechanisms are paramount additions to those previously established non-covalent couplings.</description>

      <title>Disorder effects in planar semiconductor-superconductor structures: Majorana wires versus Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder effects in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) nanowires, widely recognized as the main obstacle to realizing stable Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in these structures, have been systematically investigated theoretically in recent years. However, there are no corresponding detailed studies of disorder effects in planar Josephson junction (JJ) structures, which represent a promising alternative to the Majorana nanowire platform. In this paper, we perform a numerical analysis of the low-energy physics of JJ structures based on an effective microscopic model that includes two types of disorder, charge impurities inside the semiconductor and roughness on the surface of the superconducting film. We consider different parameter regimes, including low and high chemical potential values, weak and strong effective SM-SC coupling strengths, and weak and strong disorder strengths. The results are benchmarked using disordered hybrid nanowires realized in planar SM-SC structures similar to those involved in the fabrication of Josephson junctions and having similar model parameters and disorder strengths. We find that the topological superconducting phase hosted by a JJ structure is, generally, more robust against disorder than the topological superconductivity realized in a hybrid nanowire with similar parameters. On the other hand, we find that operating the JJ in a regime characterized by large values of chemical potential results in huge finite-size effects that can destroy the stability of MZMs.</description>

Abstract: Cooper pairs occupy the ground state of superconductors and are typically composed of maximally entangled electrons with opposite spin. In order to study the spin and entanglement properties of these electrons, one must separate them spatially via a process known as Cooper pair splitting (CPS). Here we provide the first demonstration of CPS in a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). By coupling two quantum dots to a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid region we achieve efficient Cooper pair splitting, and clearly distinguish it from other local and non-local processes. When the spin degeneracy of the dots is lifted, they can be operated as spin-filters to obtain information about the spin of the electrons forming the Cooper pair. Not only do we observe a near perfect splitting of Cooper pairs into opposite-spin electrons (i.e. conventional singlet pairing), but also into equal-spin electrons, thus achieving triplet correlations between the quantum dots. Importantly, the exceptionally large spin-orbit interaction in our 2DEGs results in a strong triplet component, comparable in amplitude to the singlet pairing. The demonstration of CPS in a scalable and flexible platform provides a credible route to study on-chip entanglement and topological superconductivity in the form of artificial Kitaev chains.</description>

Abstract: Effective field theory models capable of realizing various gapless topological states are presented in this work. After reviewing the effective field models of the Weyl and nodal line semimetal states, we study the competition of these two semimetal states in effective field theories. When the one form field giving rise to the Weyl nodes lie perpendicular to the plane where the nodal ring lives, the nodal ring and Weyl nodes could coexist as the mirror symmetry responsible for the nodal ring is not broken. New phases including a three-node state and a triple degenerate state exist. The nodal ring is immediately destroyed when the one form field lies in the plane of the ring. However, we show that in an eight-component spinor model, Weyl nodes and nodal rings could still coexist even when the one form field is parallel to the plane, due to the expanded symmetry. Finally we calculate the topological invariants in these models and in particular confirm the interesting nontrivial topology of the three-node state and the triple-degenerate node.</description>

      <title>Why magnetic monopole becomes dyon in topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Witten effect predicts that a magnetic monopole acquires a fractional electric charge inside topological insulators.
  In this work, we give a microscopic description of this phenomenon, as well as an analogous two-dimensional system with a vortex. We solve the Dirac equation of electron field both analytically in continuum and numerically on a lattice, by adding the Wilson term and smearing the gauge field within a finite range to regularize the short-distance behavior of the system. Our results reveal that the Wilson term induces a strong positive mass shift, creating a domain-wall around the monopole/vortex. This small, yet finite-sized domain-wall localizes the chiral zero modes and ensures their stability through the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, whose cobordism invariance is crucial in explaining why the electric charge is fractional.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of laser induced self-organized void array formation in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigated the formation of multi-voids in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using a multi-pulse irradiation method and explored the impact of laser energy, number of pulses per micron (writing speed), and laser spot size (NA) on the process. The experimental results revealed that multi-void formation occurred due to multi-pulse irradiation in the bulk of PDMS. Additionally, increasing laser energy led to an increase in the number of voids, while the number of voids did not change with an increase in the number of pulses per micron for a fixed laser parameter. However, the size of the voids increased with the number of pulses per micron, and tighter focusing conditions (higher NA) resulted in smaller voids with a shorter distance between them. Furthermore, Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations reproduced the generation of void arrays in PDMS using a similar multi-laser pulse approach. By modeling the voids as concentric spheres with densified shells and simulating the laser interaction with the voids, we showed that void array generation in PDMS is a linear mechanism. This study provides valuable insight into the mechanism behind the formation of void arrays in PDMS. The simulation results agrees well with the experimental results to further validate the model and gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the generation of void arrays in PDMS.</description>

      <title>Spin Space Groups: Full Classification and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we exhaust all the spin-space symmetries, which fully characterize collinear, non-collinear, commensurate, and incommensurate spiral magnetism, and investigate enriched features of electronic bands that respect these symmetries. We achieve this by systematically classifying the so-called spin space groups (SSGs) - joint symmetry groups of spatial and spin operations that leave the magnetic structure unchanged. Generally speaking, they are accurate (approximate) symmetries in systems where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is negligible (finite but weaker than the interested energy scale); but we also show that specific SSGs could remain valid even in the presence of a strong SOC. By representing the SSGs as O($N$) representations, we - for the first time - obtain the complete classifications of 1421, 9542, and 56512 distinct SSGs for collinear ($N=1$), coplanar ($N=2$), and non-coplanar ($N=3$) magnetism, respectively. SSG not only fully characterizes the symmetry of spin d.o.f., but also gives rise to exotic electronic states, which, in general, form projective representations of magnetic space groups (MSGs). Surprisingly, electronic bands in SSGs exhibit features never seen in MSGs, such as nonsymmorphic SSG Brillouin zone (BZ), where SSG operations behave as glide or screw when act on momentum and unconventional spin-momentum locking, which is completely determined by SSG, independent of Hamiltonian details. To apply our theory, we identify the SSG for each of the 1604 published magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server. Material examples exhibiting aforementioned novel features are discussed with emphasis. We also investigate new types of SSG-protected topological electronic states that are unprecedented in MSGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (TDTS) experiments demonstrating strong light-matter coupling in a terahertz (THz) LC-metamaterial in which the phonon resonance of a topological insulator (TI) thin film is coupled to the photonic modes of an array of electronic split-ring resonators. As we tune the metamaterial resonance frequency through the frequency of the low frequency $\alpha$ mode of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST), we observe strong mixing and level repulsion between phonon and metamaterial resonance. This hybrid resonance is a phonon polariton. We observe a normalized coupling strength, $\eta$ = $\Omega_R$/$\omega_c$ $\approx$ 0.09, using the measured vacuum Rabi frequency and cavity resonance. Our results demonstrate that one can tune the mechanical properties of materials by changing their electromagnetic environment and therefore modify their magnetic and topological degrees of freedom via coupling to the lattice in this fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of previously unreported magnetic modes with record-high magnetic Purcell factors in topological-insulator nanospheres. Focusing on bismuth selenide (Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$), and based on full electromagnetic Mie theory, we find magnetic modes arising from both displacement current loops in the bulk, and surface currents due to delocalized surface states, induced by electronic transitions between topologically protected states within the Dirac cone and discretized due to the sphere finite size. Furthermore, we discuss how Dirac plasmon polaritons, resulting from the interaction between THz photons and Dirac electrons, dramatically influence both the magnetic and the electric transitions of quantum emitters placed near Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanospheres, significantly enhancing the corresponding Purcell factors. These findings position Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ nanospheres, whose optical response is related to a richness of physical mechanisms, among the most promising candidates for enhancing light--matter interactions in nanophotonics and THz technologies.</description>

Abstract: Eddy currents in a superconductor shield the magnetic field in its interior and are responsible for the formation of a magnetic stray field outside of the superconducting structure. The stray field can be controlled by the external magnetic field and affect the magnetization dynamics in the magnetic system placed in its range. In the case of a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting strip placed over a magnetic layer, we predict theoretically the confinement of spin waves in the well of the static stray field. The number of bound states and their frequencies can be controlled by an external magnetic field. We have presented the results of semi-analytical calculations complemented by numerical modeling.</description>

Abstract: This review presents recent breakthroughs in the realm of nonlinear Hall effects, emphasizing central theoretical foundations and recent experimental progress. We elucidate the quantum origin of the second-order Hall response, focusing on the Berry curvature dipole, which may arise in inversion symmetry broken systems. The theoretical framework also reveals the impact of disorder scattering effects on the nonlinear response. We further discuss the possibility of obtaining nonlinear Hall responses beyond the second order. We examine symmetry-based indicators essential for the manifestation of nonlinear Hall effects in time-reversal symmetric crystals, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of theoretical models and candidate materials predicted to exhibit sizable and tunable Berry curvature dipole. We summarize groundbreaking experimental reports on measuring both intrinsic and extrinsic nonlinear Hall effects across diverse material classes. Finally, we highlight some of the other intriguing nonlinear effects, including nonlinear planar Hall, nonlinear anomalous Hall, and nonlinear spin and valley Hall effects. We conclude with an outlook on pivotal open questions and challenges, marking the trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.</description>

Abstract: Well-known Mott's formula links the thermoelectric power characterised by Seebeck coefficient to conductivity. We calculate analytically the thermoelectric current and Seebeck coefficient in one-dimensional systems and show that, while the prediction of Mott's formula is valid for Dirac fermions, it is misleading for the carriers having a parabolic dispersion. We apply the developed formalism to metallic single wall carbon nanotubes and obtain a non-trivial non-monotonic dependence of the Seebeck coefficient on the chemical potential. We emphasize that, in contrast to Mott's formula, the classical Kelvin's formula that links thermoelectric power to the temperature derivative of the chemical potential is perfectly valid in carbon nanotubes in the ballistic regime. Interestingly, however, the Kelvin's formula fails in two- and three-dimensional systems in the ballistic regime.</description>

      <title>Electron binding energy of a donor in bilayer graphene with gate-tunable gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gapped bilayer graphene, similarly to conventional semiconductors, Coulomb impurities (such as nitrogen donors) may determine the activation energy of its conductivity and provide low temperature hopping conductivity. However, in spite of the importance of Coulomb impurities, nothing is known about their electron binding energy $E_b$ in the presence of gates. To close this gap, we study numerically the electron binding energy $E_b$ of a singly charged donor in BN-enveloped bilayer graphene with the top and bottom gates at distance $d$ and gate-tunable gap $2\Delta$. We show that for $10 &lt; d &lt; 200$ nm and $1 &lt; \Delta &lt; 100$ meV the ratio $E_b/\Delta$ changes from 0.4 to 1.5. The ratio $E_b/\Delta$ stays close to unity because of the dominating role of the bilayer polarization screening which reduces the Coulomb potential well depth to values $\sim \Delta$. Still the ratio $E_b/\Delta$ somewhat decreases with growing $\Delta$, faster at small $\Delta$ and slower at large $\Delta$. On the other hand, $E_b/\Delta$ weakly grows with $d$, again faster at small $\Delta$ and slower at large $\Delta$. We also studied the effect of trigonal warping and found only a small reduction of $E_b/\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Origin of giant magnetoresistance in layered nodal-line semimetal TaNiTe5 nanoflakes</title>

Abstract: Layered transition metal chalcogenides have stimulated a wide research interest due to their many exotic physical properties. In this paper, we studied the magnetotransport properties of the exfoliated TaNiTe5, a recently discovered Dirac nodal-line semimetal. A giant positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed when the current is parallel to the crystallographic c axis, while it is strongly diminished when the current flows along the a axis. The observed giant MR is gradually suppressed either on reducing the thickness of nanoflake or on increasing temperature. By performing MR measurement in tilted magnetic fields, the interlayer coupling is found to be weakened both by reducing the thickness and by increasing temperature. We propose a mechanism of electron-electron interaction-assisted interlayer transport as a origin of the giant MR. The mechanism is likely to provide a explanation for the giant MR in other layered materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.</description>

Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It provides a unified description to topological phase transitions caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Negative longitudinal resistance of monolayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quantum Hall regime the charge current is carried by ideal one-dimensional edge channels where the backscattering is prohibited by topology. This results in the constant potential along the edge of the Hall bar leading to zero 4-terminal longitudinal resistance r_xx. Finite scattering between the counter-propagating edge states, when the topological protection is broken, commonly results in r_xx &gt; 0. However, a local disorder, if allowing intersection of the edge states, can result in a counter-intuitive scenario when r_xx&lt;0. In this work we report the observation and a systematic study of such unconventional negative longitudinal resistance seen in an encapsulated monolayer graphene Hall bar device measured in the quantum Hall regime. We supplement our findings with the numerical calculations which allow us to outline the conditions necessary for the appearance of negative r_xx and to exclude the macroscopic disorder (contamination bubble) as the main origin of it.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for a Boundary-Driven Double Spin Chain and Resource-Efficient Remote Entanglement Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09482</link>

Abstract: We derive an exact solution for the steady state of a setup where two $XX$-coupled $N$-qubit spin chains (with possibly non-uniform couplings) are subject to boundary Rabi drives, and common boundary loss generated by a waveguide (either bidirectional or unidirectional). For a wide range of parameters, this system has a pure entangled steady state, providing a means for stabilizing remote multi-qubit entanglement without the use of squeezed light. Our solution also provides insights into a single boundary-driven dissipative $XX$ spin chain that maps to an interacting fermionic model. The non-equilibrium steady state exhibits surprising correlation effects, including an emergent pairing of hole excitations that arises from dynamically constrained hopping. Our system could be implemented in a number of experimental platforms, including circuit QED.</description>

      <title>Transport signatures of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in normal metal/time-reversal symmetry broken $d$-wave superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent times, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in superconductors (SCs) have drawn significant attention due to a substantial population of Bogoliubov quasiparticles (BQPs) together with Cooper pairs (CPs) in them. The BQPs as zero energy excitations give rise to captivating and intricate charge dynamics within the BFSs. In this theoretical study, we propose to reveal the unique signatures of the topologically protected BFSs in bulk $d$-wave SCs using normal metal/time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken $d$-wave SC hybrid setup, in terms of the differential conductance and Fano factor (FF). Orientation of crystal $a$ axis with respect to junction normal, quantified by the parameter $\alpha$, is crucial for transport properties in these hybrid devices. For $\alpha=0$, an enhancement in zero-bias conductance (ZBC) can be identified as a key signature of BFSs. However, for $\alpha\ne0$, this feature does not replicate due to the presence of the localized Andreev bound state (ABS) at the interface. The interplay of ABS and BFSs gives rise to an anomalous behavior in ZBC compared to the $\alpha=0$ case. This behavior remains qualitatively similar even at finite temperatures. Finally, we explain this anomalous behavior by analyzing the effective charge of the carriers in terms of the FF. The simplicity of our setup based on $d$-wave SC makes our proposal persuasive.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of buried heterointerfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterointerface from a single-view data set using multislice ptychography. We identify the buried heterointerface between two twisted h-BN flakes with a lateral resolution of 0.57 {\AA} and a depth resolution of 2.5 nm. The latter is a significant improvement (~2.7 times) over the aperture-limited depth resolution of incoherent imaging modes such as annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. This is attributed to the diffraction signal extending beyond the aperture edge with the depth resolution set by the curvature of the Ewald sphere. Future advances to this approach could improve the depth resolution to the sub-nanometer level and enable the identification of individual dopants, defects and color centers in twisted heterointerfaces and other materials.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When many body system in Classical Mechanics is described using bi-Hamiltonian for its group of particles which forms a coarse grained bead, the damping energy from the heat bath perturbs the motion of a particle which is along the trajectory of multiple Hamiltonian system simultaneously. As managing the coarse grained modeling of the suspended semiflexible polymer like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) in vacuum, the authors discovered that such interconnection between Hamiltonian systems as sharing a heat bath builds a strongly coupled system. The consequence of this interconnection is revealed to form certain form of cross correlated momentum in coarsed grained system as well as in the original atomic scales. In this paper, we adapt the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics to describe the cross correlation of bi-Hamiltonian system which replicates the macroscopic behaviour of SWCNT under the Smoluchowski picture for cross correlation between Hamiltonian systems. The numerical experiments using collision between tubes confirms the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the abnormaly from cross correlated momentum.</description>

      <title>Circular Photocurrents in Centrosymmetric Semiconductors with Hidden Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centrosymmetric materials with site inversion asymmetries possess hidden spin polarization, which remains challenging to be converted into spin currents because the global inversion symmetry is still conserved. This study demonstrates the spin-polarized DC circular photocurrents (CPC) in centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) at normal incidence without applying electric bias. The global inversion symmetry is broken by using a spatially-varying circularly polarized light beam, which could generate spin gradient owing to the hidden spin polarization. The dependences of the CPC on electrode configuration, illumination position, and beam spot size indicate an emergence of circulating electric current under spatially inhomogeneous light, which is associated with the deflection of spin-polarized current through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The CPC is subsequently utilized to probe the spin polarization and ISHE under different excitation wavelengths and temperatures. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using centrosymmetric materials with hidden spin polarization and non-vanishing Berry curvature for spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Towards the Quantized Anomalous Hall effect in AlO$_x$-capped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ harbors a rich interplay between magnetism and topology, holding a significant promise for low-power electronic devices and topological antiferromagnetic spintronics. In recent years, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ has garnered considerable attention as the only known material to exhibit the antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, this field faces significant challenges as realizing quantized transport at zero magnetic fields depends critically on fabricating high-quality device. In this article, we address the detrimental influences of fabrication on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ by simply depositing an AlO$_x$ thin layer on the surface prior to fabrications. Optical contrast and magnetotransport measurements on over 50 samples demonstrate that AlO$_x$ can effectively preserve the pristine state of the samples and significantly enhance the anomalous Hall effect towards quantization. Scaling analysis reveals the Berry curvature dominated mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect at various magnetic configurations. By adjusting the gate voltage, we uncover a gate independent antiferromagnetism in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our experiment not only pave the way for fabricating high-quality transport devices but also advance the exploration of exotic quantum physics in 2D materials.</description>
