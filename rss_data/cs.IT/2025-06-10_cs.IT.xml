      <title>Statistical Limits for Finite-Rank Tensor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a unified framework for analyzing tensor estimation problems that allow for nonlinear observations, heteroskedastic noise, and covariate information. We study a general class of high-dimensional models where each observation depends on the interactions among a finite number of unknown parameters. Our main results provide asymptotically exact formulas for the mutual information (equivalently, the free energy) as well as the minimum mean-squared error in the Bayes-optimal setting. We then apply this framework to derive sharp characterizations of statistical thresholds for two novel scenarios: (1) tensor estimation in heteroskedastic noise that is independent but not identically distributed, and (2) higher-order assignment problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown permutation from tensor-valued observations.</description>

      <title>MIMO Pinching-Antenna-Aided SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a promising technology for improving wireless communications by establishing or strengthening reliable line-of-sight (LoS) links by adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs). Motivated by these benefits, we propose a novel PASS-aided multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where the PASS are equipped with multiple waveguides to provide information transmission and wireless power transfer (WPT) for several multiple antenna information decoding receivers (IDRs), and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs), respectively. Based on the system, we consider maximizing the sum-rate of all IDRs while guaranteeing the minimum harvested energy of each EHR by jointly optimizing the pinching beamforming and the PA positions. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we iteratively optimize the pinching beamforming based on a weighted minimum mean-squared-error (WMMSE) method and update the PA positions with a Gauss-Seidel-based approach in an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Numerical results verify the significant superiority of the PASS compared with conventional designs.</description>

      <title>Polarized Element-pair Code Based FFMA over a Gaussian Multiple-access Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents polarized element-pair (EP) codes for polarization-adjusted finite-field multiple-access (PA-FFMA) systems. The core innovation of FFMA systems lies in their unique processing order that exchanges the conventional sequence of channel coding and multiplexing operations, effectively solving the multiuser finite-blocklength (FBL) problem while enhancing error performance. In this architecture, EPs serve as virtual resources for user separation, where different EP codes provide distinct error performance characteristics. The proposed polarized EP code differs from classical polar codes in one aspect that it is specifically designed for Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC) environments rather than single-user Gaussian channels. We derive the channel capacity for this polarized EP code based FFMA system, then develop an optimal power allocation scheme to maximize multiuser channel capacity. The code construction employs the Marto Loco method for selecting the polarized index set. For decoding, we introduce two specialized algorithms. A successive cancellation list (SCL) decoder for the balanced information-parity section scenarios, and a top $L$ bifurcated minimum distance (Top$L$-BMD) decoder for small payload cases while maintaining comparable error performance. Simulations show that, for $15$ users, our system achieves a $1.25$ dB coding gain compared to the state-of-the-art polar random spreading systems.</description>

      <title>Passive Detection in Multi-Static ISAC Systems: Performance Analysis and Joint Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the passive detection problem in multi-static integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where multiple sensing receivers (SRs) jointly detect a target using random unknown communication signals transmitted by a collaborative base station. Unlike traditional active detection, the considered passive detection does not require complete prior knowledge of the transmitted communication signals at each SR. First, we derive a generalized likelihood ratio test detector and conduct an asymptotic analysis of the detection statistic under the large-sample regime. We examine how the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the target paths and direct paths influence the detection performance. Then, we propose two joint transmit beamforming designs based on the analyses. In the first design, the asymptotic detection probability is maximized while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirement for each communication user under the total transmit power constraint. Given the non-convex nature of the problem, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm based on the quadratic transform and semi-definite relaxation. The second design adopts a heuristic approach that aims to maximize the target energy, subject to a minimum SNR threshold on the direct path, and offers lower computational complexity. Numerical results validate the asymptotic analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed beamforming designs in balancing passive detection performance and communication quality. This work highlights the promise of target detection using unknown communication data signals in multi-static ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Maximization for Movable Antenna Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates energy efficiency maximization for movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user uplink communication systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption incurred by practical antenna movement. We first examine the special case with a single user and propose an optimization algorithm based on the one-dimensional (1D) exhaustive search to maximize the user's energy efficiency. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the energy efficiency and analyze the conditions required to achieve this performance bound under different numbers of channel paths. Then, for the general multi-user scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm to fairly maximize the minimum energy efficiency among all users. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving energy efficiency compared to existing MA schemes that do not account for movement-related costs, as well as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) scheme. In addition, the results show the robustness of the proposed scheme to imperfect channel state information (CSI) and provide valuable insights for practical system deployment.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-Empowered Receive Spatial Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA), as an emerging antenna technology, fully exploits spatial diversity. This paper integrates FA with the receive spatial modulation (RSM) scheme and proposes a novel FA-empowered RSM (FA-RSM) system. In this system, the transmitter is equipped with an FA that simultaneously activates multiple ports to transmit precoded signals. We address three key challenges in the FA-RSM system: port selection, theoretical analysis, and detection. First, for port selection, an optimal algorithm from a capacity maximization perspective are proposed, followed by two low-complexity alternatives. Second, for theoretical analysis, performance evaluation metrics are provided for port selection, which demonstrate that increasing the number of activated ports enhances system performance. Third, regarding detection, two low-complexity detectors are proposed. Simulation results confirm that the FA-RSM system significantly outperforms the conventional RSM system. The proposed low-complexity port selection algorithms facilitate minimal performance degradation. Moreover, while activating additional ports improves performance, the gain gradually saturates due to inherent spatial correlation, highlighting the importance of effective port selection in reducing system complexity and cost. Finally, both proposed detectors achieve near-optimal detection performance with low computational complexity, emphasizing the receiver-friendly nature of the FA-RSM system.</description>

      <title>The error-correcting pair for several classes of NMDS linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The error-correcting pair is a general algebraic decoding method for linear codes. The near maximal distance separable (NMDS) linear code is a subclass of linear codes and has applications in secret sharing scheme and communication systems due to the efficient performance, thus we focus on the error-correcting pair of NMDS linear codes. In 2023, He and Liao showed that for an NMDS linear code $\mathcal{C}$ with minimal distance $2\ell+1$ or $2\ell+2$, if $\mathcal{C}$ has an $\ell$-error-correcting pair $\left( \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \right)$, then the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ have 6 or 10 possibilities, respectively.
  In this manuscript, basing on Product Singleton Bound, we give several necessary conditions for that the NMDS linear code $\mathcal{C}$ with minimal distance $2\ell+1$ has an $\ell$-error-correcting pair $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$, where the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 1st, 2nd, 4th or 5th case, then basing on twisted generalized Reed-Solomon codes, we give an example for that the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 1st case. Moreover, we also give several necessary conditions for that the NMDS linear code $\mathcal{C}$ with minimal distance $2\ell+2$ has an $\ell$-error-correcting pair $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$, where the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 2nd, 4th, 7th or 8th case, then we give an example for that the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 1st or 2nd case, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distributed Image Semantic Communication via Nonlinear Transform Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates distributed source-channel coding for correlated image semantic transmission over wireless channels. In this setup, correlated images at different transmitters are separately encoded and transmitted through dedicated channels for joint recovery at the receiver. We propose a general approach for distributed image semantic communication that applies to both separate source and channel coding (SSCC) and joint source-channel coding (JSCC). Unlike existing learning-based approaches that implicitly learn source correlation in a purely data-driven manner, our method leverages nonlinear transform coding (NTC) to explicitly model source correlation from both probabilistic and geometric perspectives. A joint entropy model approximates the joint distribution of latent representations to guide adaptive rate allocation, while a transformation module aligns latent features for maximal correlation learning at the decoder. We implement this framework as D-NTSC for SSCC and D-NTSCC for JSCC, both built on Swin Transformers for effective feature extraction and correlation exploitation. Variational inference is employed to derive principled loss functions that jointly optimize encoding, decoding, and joint entropy modeling. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that D-NTSC and D-NTSCC outperform existing distributed SSCC and distributed JSCC baselines, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level and perceptual quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Flexible MIMO for Future Wireless Communications: Which Flexibilities are Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable next-generation wireless communication networks with modest spectrum availability, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology needs to undergo further evolution. In this paper, we introduce a promising next-generation wireless communication concept: flexible MIMO technology. This technology represents a MIMO technology with flexible physical configurations and integrated applications. We categorize twelve representative flexible MIMO technologies into three major classifications: flexible deployment characteristics-based, flexible geometry characteristics-based, and flexible real-time modifications-based. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of their fundamental characteristics, potential, and challenges. Furthermore, we demonstrate three vital enablers for the flexible MIMO technology, including efficient channel state information (CSI) acquisition schemes, low-complexity beamforming design, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled optimization. Within these areas, eight critical sub-enabling technologies are discussed in detail. Finally, we present two case studies-pre-optimized irregular arrays and cell-free movable antennas-where significant potential for flexible MIMO technologies to enhance the system capacity is showcased.</description>

      <title>Criss-Cross Deletion Correcting Codes: Optimal Constructions with Efficient Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses fundamental challenges in two-dimensional error correction by constructing optimal codes for \emph{criss-cross deletions}. We consider an $ n \times n $ array over a $ q $-ary alphabet $\Sigma_q := \{0, 1, \ldots, q-1\}$ that is subject to a \emph{$(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletion}, which involves the simultaneous removal of $ t_r $ rows and $ t_c $ columns. A code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \Sigma_q^{n \times n}$ is defined as a \emph{$(t_r,t_c)$-criss-cross deletion correcting code} if it can successfully correct these deletions. We derive a sphere-packing type lower bound and a Gilbert-Varshamov type upper bound on the redundancy of optimal codes. Our results indicate that the optimal redundancy for a $(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletion correcting code lies between $(t_r + t_c)n\log q + (t_r + t_c)\log n + O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$ and $(t_r + t_c)n\log q + 2(t_r + t_c)\log n + O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$, where the logarithm is on base two, and $O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$ is a constant that depends solely on $q$, $t_r$, and $t_c$. For the case of $(1,1)$-criss-cross deletions, we develop two families of constructions. One achieves a redundancy of $2n\log q + 2\log n$ for non-binary alphabets, while the other requires $2n\log q + 2\log n + O_q(1)$ bits of redundancy for arbitrary alphabets. Both constructions match our lower bound, differing only by a constant $O_q(1)$ that depends solely on $q$, thereby confirming their optimality. For the case of $(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletions, we provide a strategy to derive optimal codes when both unidirectional deletions occur consecutively. We propose decoding algorithms with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for our codes, which are optimal for two-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>Correcting Errors Through Partitioning and Burst-Deletion Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a partitioning technique that decomposes a pair of sequences with overlapping $t$-deletion $s$-substitution balls into sub-pairs, where the $^{\leq}t$-burst-deletion balls of each sub-pair intersect. This decomposition facilitates the development of $t$-deletion $s$-substitution correcting codes that leverage approaches from $^{\leq}t$-burst-deletion correction. Building upon established approaches in the $^{\leq}t$-burst-deletion correction domain, we construct $t$-deletion $s$-substitution correcting codes for $t\in \{1,2\}$ over binary alphabets and for $t=1$ in non-binary alphabets, with some constructions matching existing results and others outperforming current methods. Our framework offers new insights into the underlying principles of prior works, elucidates the limitations of current approaches, and provides a unified perspective on error correction strategies.</description>

      <title>A General Coding Framework for Adaptive Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of $T$-colluding private information retrieval (PIR) enables the user to retrieve one out of $M$ files from a distributed storage system with $N$ servers without revealing anything about the index of the desired file to any group of up to $T$ colluding servers. In the considered storage system, the $M$ files are stored across the $N$ distributed servers in an $X$-secure $K$-coded manner such that any group of up to $X$ colluding servers learns nothing about the files; the storage overhead at each server is reduced by a factor of $\frac{1}{K}$ compared to the total size of the files; and the files can be reconstructed from any $K+X$ servers. However, in practical scenarios, when the user retrieves the desired file from the distributed system, some servers may respond to the user very slowly or not respond at all. These servers are referred to as \emph{stragglers}, and particularly their identities and numbers are unknown in advance and may change over time. This paper considers the adaptive PIR problem that can be capable of tolerating the presence of a varying number of stragglers. We propose a general coding method for designing adaptive PIR schemes by introducing the concept of a \emph{feasible PIR coding framework}. We demonstrate that any \emph{feasible PIR coding framework} over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with size $q$ can be used to construct an adaptive PIR scheme that achieves a retrieval rate of $1-\frac{K+X+T-1}{N-S}$ simultaneously for all numbers of stragglers $0\leq S\leq N-(K+X+T)$ over the same finite field. Additionally, we provide an implementation of the \emph{feasible PIR coding framework}, ensuring that the adaptive PIR scheme operates over any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with size $q\geq N+\max\{K, N-(K+X+T-1)\}$.</description>

      <title>Learned Off-Grid Imager for Low-Altitude Economy with Cooperative ISAC Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy is emerging as a key driver of future economic growth, necessitating effective flight activity surveillance using existing mobile cellular network sensing capabilities. However, traditional monostatic and localizationbased sensing methods face challenges in fusing sensing results and matching channel parameters. To address these challenges, we model low-altitude surveillance as a compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging problem by leveraging the cooperation of multiple base stations and the inherent sparsity of aerial images. Additionally, we derive the point spread function to analyze the influences of different antenna, subcarrier, and resolution settings on the imaging performance. Given the random spatial distribution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we propose a physics-embedded learning method to mitigate off-grid errors in traditional CS-based approaches. Furthermore, to enhance rare UAV detection in vast low-altitude airspace, we integrate an online hard example mining scheme into the loss function design, enabling the network to adaptively focus on samples with significant discrepancies from the ground truth during training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed low-altitude surveillance framework. The proposed physicsembedded learning algorithm achieves a 97.55% detection rate, significantly outperforming traditional CS-based methods under off-grid conditions. Part of the source code for this paper will be soon accessed at https://github.com/kiwi1944/LAEImager.</description>

      <title>On the Fixed-Length-Burst Levenshtein Ball with Unit Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a length-$n$ sequence $\bm{x}$ over a $q$-ary alphabet. The \emph{fixed-length Levenshtein ball} $\mathcal{L}_t(\bm{x})$ of radius $t$ encompasses all length-$n$ $q$-ary sequences that can be derived from $\bm{x}$ by performing $t$ deletions followed by $t$ insertions. Analyzing the size and structure of these balls presents significant challenges in combinatorial coding theory. Recent studies have successfully characterized fixed-length Levenshtein balls in the context of a single deletion and a single insertion. These works have derived explicit formulas for various key metrics, including the exact size of the balls, extremal bounds (minimum and maximum sizes), as well as expected sizes and their concentration properties. However, the general case involving an arbitrary number of $t$ deletions and $t$ insertions $(t&gt;1)$ remains largely uninvestigated. This work systematically examines fixed-length Levenshtein balls with multiple deletions and insertions, focusing specifically on \emph{fixed-length burst Levenshtein balls}, where deletions occur consecutively, as do insertions. We provide comprehensive solutions for explicit cardinality formulas, extremal bounds (minimum and maximum sizes), expected size, and concentration properties surrounding the expected value.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Optimization for MIMO ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: A PCRB-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) with transceiver hybrid analog-digital arrays transmits dual-functional signals to communicate with a multi-antenna user and simultaneously sense the unknown and random location information of a target based on the reflected echo signals and the prior distribution information on the target's location. Under transceiver hybrid arrays, we characterize the sensing performance by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error which is a function of the transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming. We study joint transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming optimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate requirement. We first consider a sensing-only system and derive the optimal solution to each element in the transmit/receive analog beamforming matrices that minimizes the PCRB in closed form. Then, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm. Next, we study a narrowband MIMO ISAC system and devise an efficient AO-based hybrid beamforming algorithm by leveraging weighted minimum mean-squared error and feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation methods. Furthermore, we extend the results for narrowband systems to a MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming designs. It is revealed that the number of receive RF chains has more significant impact on the sensing performance than its transmit counterpart. Under a given budget on the total number of transmit/receive RF chains at the BS, the optimal number of transmit RF chains increases as the communication rate target increases due to the non-trivial PCRB-rate trade-off.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay of Privacy, Persuasion and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a communication-theoretic framework for privacy-aware and resilient decision making in cyber-physical systems under misaligned objectives between the encoder and the decoder. The encoder observes two correlated signals ($X$,$\theta$) and transmits a finite-rate message $Z$ to aid a legitimate controller (the decoder) in estimating $X+\theta$, while an eavesdropper intercepts $Z$ to infer the private parameter $\theta$. Unlike conventional setups where encoder and decoder share a common MSE objective, here the encoder minimizes a Lagrangian that balances legitimate control fidelity and the privacy leakage about $\theta$. In contrast, the decoder's goal is purely to minimize its own estimation error without regard for privacy. We analyze fully, partially, and non-revealing strategies that arise from this conflict, and characterize optimal linear encoders when the rate constraints are lifted. For finite-rate channels, we employ gradient-based methods to compute the optimal controllers. Numerical experiments illustrate how tuning the privacy parameter shapes the trade-off between control performance and resilience against unauthorized inferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cascaded multiwire-power line communication (PLC)/multiple-visible light communication (VLC) system. This hybrid architecture offers low installation cost, enhanced performance, practical feasibility, and a wide range of applications. Novel analytical expressions are derived for key statistics and outage probability, bit error probability, and ergodic channel capacity metrics. Furthermore, the analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations, with several performance curves presented under various channel and PLC/VLC system parameters. All expressions derived in this work are original and have not been previously published. Our proposed system proves feasible for smart environments, green communication systems, internet of things networks, industrial environments, and next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Model-based Neural Data Augmentation for sub-wavelength Radio Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical fingerprinting methods.</description>

      <title>HeavyWater and SimplexWater: Watermarking Low-Entropy Text Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens. LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks - such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks: HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks, demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater</description>

      <title>GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</description>

      <title>Skewness of von Neumann entropy over Bures-Hall random states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the degree of entanglement, as measured by von Neumann entropy, of bipartite systems over the Bures-Hall ensemble. Closed-form expressions of the first two cumulants of von Neumann entropy over the ensemble have been recently derived in the literature. In this paper, we focus on its skewness by calculating the third cumulant that describes the degree of asymmetry of the distribution. The main result is an exact closed-form formula of the third cumulant, which leads to a more accurate approximation to the distribution of von Neumann entropy. The key to obtaining the result lies on finding a dozen of new summation identities in simplifying a large number of finite summations involving polygamma functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. The optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. We prove these inequalities in the cases of state ensembles corresponding to acute or flat pyramids, thus providing the proof of the hypothesis concerning the globally information-optimal observable.</description>

      <title>Cross-Entropy Games for Language Models: From Implicit Knowledge to General Capability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Pixel-Sensitive and Robust Steganography Based on Polar Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steganography is an information hiding technique for covert communication. The core issue in steganography design is the rate-distortion coding problem. Polar codes, which have been proven to achieve the rate-distortion bound for any binary symmetric source, are utilized to design a steganographic scheme that can reach the embedding capacity for the Distortion-Limited Sender problem in certain cases. In adaptive steganography, for attack scenarios where each noise element can have different intensities, existing steganographic coding methods fail to resist such attacks. In this paper, we propose a pixel-sensitive and robust steganographic scheme based on polar codes. Our steganographic scheme not only matches the adaptive distortion well but is also robust against sophisticated noise attacks. Futher, it is proven that our scheme achieves the embedding capacity in certain cases. Experimentally, a steganographic scheme can be designed and implemented with a secret message error rate at the $10^{-5}$ level when the attack noise is known to both the sender and the receiver. This demonstrates its significant robustness.</description>

      <title>The Universality Lens: Why Even Highly Over-Parametrized Models Learn Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in modern machine learning is why large, over-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks and transformers, tend to generalize well, even when their number of parameters far exceeds the number of training samples.
  We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, grounded in universal learning theory. Specifically, we study a Bayesian mixture learner with log-loss and (almost) uniform prior over an expansive hypothesis class.
  Our key result shows that the learner's regret is not determined by the overall size of the hypothesis class, but rather by the cumulative probability of all models that are close, in Kullback-Leibler divergence distance, to the true data-generating process. We refer to this cumulative probability as the weight of the hypothesis.
  This leads to a natural notion of model simplicity: simple models are those with large weight and thus require fewer samples to generalize, while complex models have small weight and need more data. This perspective provides a rigorous and intuitive explanation for why over-parameterized models often avoid overfitting: the presence of simple hypotheses allows the posterior to concentrate on them when supported by the data.
  We further bridge theory and practice by recalling that stochastic gradient descent with Langevin dynamics samples from the correct posterior distribution, enabling our theoretical learner to be approximated using standard machine learning methods combined with ensemble learning.
  Our analysis yields non-uniform regret bounds and aligns with key practical concepts such as flat minima and model distillation. The results apply broadly across online, batch, and supervised learning settings, offering a unified and principled understanding of the generalization behavior of modern AI systems.</description>

      <title>Generalization Analysis for Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many settings in science and industry, such as drug discovery and clinical trials, a central challenge is designing experiments under time and budget constraints. Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a paradigm to pick maximally informative designs that has been increasingly applied to such problems. During training, BOED selects inputs according to a pre-determined acquisition criterion. During testing, the model learned during training encounters a naturally occurring distribution of test samples. This leads to an instance of covariate shift, where the train and test samples are drawn from different distributions. Prior work has shown that in the presence of model misspecification, covariate shift amplifies generalization error. Our first contribution is to provide a mathematical decomposition of generalization error that reveals key contributors to generalization error in the presence of model misspecification. We show that generalization error under misspecification is the result of, in addition to covariate shift, a phenomenon we term error (de-)amplification which has not been identified or studied in prior work. Our second contribution is to provide a detailed empirical analysis to show that methods that result in representative and de-amplifying training data increase generalization performance. Our third contribution is to develop a novel acquisition function that mitigates the effects of model misspecification by including a term for representativeness and implicitly inducing de-amplification. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional BOED in the presence of misspecification.</description>

      <title>Fairness Overfitting in Machine Learning: An Information-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in promoting fairness in high-stake applications using machine learning models, existing methods often modify the training process, such as through regularizers or other interventions, but lack formal guarantees that fairness achieved during training will generalize to unseen data. Although overfitting with respect to prediction performance has been extensively studied, overfitting in terms of fairness loss has received far less attention. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing fairness generalization error through an information-theoretic lens. Our novel bounding technique is based on Efron-Stein inequality, which allows us to derive tight information-theoretic fairness generalization bounds with both Mutual Information (MI) and Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). Our empirical results validate the tightness and practical relevance of these bounds across diverse fairness-aware learning algorithms. Our framework offers valuable insights to guide the design of algorithms improving fairness generalization.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Information Requirements for Causal Network Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovery of the causal structure of dynamic networks from noisy measurements has long been a problem of interest across many areas of science and engineering. Many algorithms have been proposed, but there is little work that compares the performance of the algorithms to converse bounds in a non-asymptotic setting. As a step to address this problem, this paper gives lower bounds on the error probability for causal network support recovery in a linear Gaussian setting. The bounds are based on Monte Carlo estimation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on likelihood ratio samples assuming side information is available. The estimated ROC curves and curves obtained through the use of Bhattacharyya coefficients or Kullback--Leibler divergences are also compared.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Optimal Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves from Likelihood Ratio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, giving the maximum probability of detection as a function of the probability of false alarm, is a key information-theoretic indicator of the difficulty of a binary hypothesis testing problem (BHT). It is well known that the optimal ROC curve for a given BHT, corresponding to the likelihood ratio test, is determined by the probability distribution of the observed data under each of the two hypotheses. In some cases, these two distributions may be unknown or computationally intractable, but independent samples of the likelihood ratio can be observed. This raises the problem of estimating the optimal ROC for a BHT from such samples. The maximum likelihood estimator of the optimal ROC curve is derived, and it is shown to converge almost surely to the true optimal ROC curve in the \levy\ metric, as the number of observations tends to infinity. Finite sample size bounds are obtained for three other estimators: the classical empirical estimator, based on estimating the two types of error probabilities from two separate sets of samples, and two variations of the maximum likelihood estimator called the split estimator and fused estimator, respectively. The maximum likelihood estimator is observed in simulation experiments to be considerably more accurate than the empirical estimator, especially when the number of samples obtained under one of the two hypotheses is small. The area under the maximum likelihood estimator is derived; it is a consistent estimator of the area under the true optimal ROC curve.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for quasi-cyclic (QC) codes with index even to be symplectic self-orthogonal. Subsequently, we present the lower and upper bounds on the minimum symplectic distances of a class of $1$-generator QC codes and their symplectic dual codes by decomposing code spaces. As an application, we construct numerous new binary symplectic self-orthogonal QC codes with excellent parameters, leading to $117$ record-breaking quantum error-correction codes.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Resolvability, Noise Stability, and Anti-contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07660v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates three closely related topics -- R\'enyi resolvability, noise stability, and anti-contractivity. The R\'enyi resolvability problem refers to approximating a target output distribution of a given channel in the R\'enyi divergence when the input is set to a function of a given uniform random variable. This problem for the R\'enyi parameter in $(0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$ was first studied by the present author and Tan in 2019. In the present paper, we provide a complete solution to this problem for the R\'enyi parameter in the entire range $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$. We then connect the R\'enyi resolvability problem to the noise stability problem, by observing that maximizing or minimizing the $q$-stability of a set is equivalent to a variant of the R\'enyi resolvability problem. By such a connection, we provide sharp dimension-free bounds on the $q$-stability. We lastly relate the noise stability problem to the anti-contractivity of a Markov operator (i.e., conditional expectation operator), where the terminology ``anti-contractivity'' introduced by us refers to as the opposite property of the well-known contractivity/hyercontractivity. We derive sharp dimension-free anti-contractivity inequalities. All of the results in this paper are evaluated for binary distributions. Our proofs in this paper are mainly based on the method of types, especially strengthened versions of packing-covering lemmas.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

      <title>Toward Practical and Theoretical Integration of Sensing and Communication in URA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) involving a massive number of unsourced and uncoordinated users. In the proposed model, known as the unsourced ISAC system (UNISAC), all active communication and sensing users simultaneously share a short frame to transmit their signals without requiring scheduling by the base station or the need to announce their identities. Consequently, the received signal from each user is heavily affected by interference from numerous other users, making it challenging to extract individual transmissions. UNISAC is designed to decode the message sequences from communication users while simultaneously detecting active sensing users and estimating their angles of arrival, regardless of the senders' identities. We derive an approximate achievable result for UNISAC and demonstrate its advantages over conventional methods, such as ALOHA, time-division multiple access, treating interference as noise, and multiple signal classification. Additionally, we propose a practical model that validates the feasibility of the approximate achievable result, showing comparable or even superior performance in scenarios with a small number of users. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both the practical UNISAC model and the approximate achievable result.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nearest Neighbor Decoding: General Input Constellation and a Case Study of Interference Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, generalized nearest neighbor decoding (GNND), a recently proposed receiver architecture, is studied for channels under general input constellations, and multiuser uplink interference suppression is employed as a case study for demonstrating its potential. In essence, GNND generalizes the well-known nearest neighbor decoding, by introducing a symbol-level memoryless processing step, which can be rendered seamlessly compatible with Gaussian channel-based decoders. First, criteria of the optimal GNND are derived for general input constellations, expressed in the form of conditional moments matching, thereby generalizing the prior work which has been confined to Gaussian input. Then, the optimal GNND is applied to the use case of multiuser uplink, for which the optimal GNND is shown to be capable of achieving information rates nearly identical to the channel mutual information. By contrast, the commonly used channel linearization (CL) approach incurs a noticeable rate loss. A coded modulation scheme is subsequently developed, aiming at implementing GNND using off-the-shelf channel codes, without requiring iterative message passing between demodulator and decoder. Through numerical experiments it is validated that the developed scheme significantly outperforms the CL-based scheme.</description>

      <title>Turbo Receiver Design with Joint Detection and Demapping for Coded Differential PSK in Bursty Impulsive Noise Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recognized that the impulsive noise (IN) generated by power devices poses significant challenges to wireless receivers. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the achievable information rate (AIR) for the well-established Markov-Middleton IN model with a phase-shift keying (PSK) input sequence across various channel conditions, including matched and mismatched decoding scenarios. Upon determining information-theoretic bounds, we propose an optimal turbo-DPSK-IN receiver design based on a commonly used commercial transmission setup consisting of a convolutional encoder, bit-level interleaver, and a differential PSK (DPSK) symbol mapper. We show that by incorporating the differential decoder into the maximum a-posteriori-based (MAP) IN detector, we can significantly enhance the receiver performance with a 4.5dB gain compared to the conventional MAP-based PSK-IN receiver and a gap of around 1dB to the theoretical bounds. We also propose a suboptimal separate receiver design that can be implemented with half the complexity of the joint design and near-optimal performance. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed receiver designs through extensive simulations, demonstrating their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with limited interleaver depth and mismatched state implementation.</description>

      <title>Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a large model-driven framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively at affordable complexity, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. In a typical image semantic communication setup, we demonstrate a significant improvement of the bandwidth efficiency, achieved by TokCom by leveraging the context information among tokens. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: The rapid development of the quantum technology presents huge opportunities for 6G communications. Leveraging the quantum properties of highly excited Rydberg atoms, Rydberg atom-based antennas present distinct advantages, such as high sensitivity, broad frequency range, and compact size, over traditional antennas. To realize efficient precoding, accurate channel state information is essential. However, due to the distinct characteristics of atomic receivers, traditional channel estimation algorithms developed for conventional receivers are no longer applicable. To this end, we propose a novel channel estimation algorithm based on projection gradient descent (PGD), which is applicable to both one-dimensional (1D) and twodimensional (2D) arrays. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation method.</description>

      <title>Unique Decoding of Reed-Solomon and Related Codes for Semi-Adversarial Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a quarter century, the Guruswami--Sudan algorithm has served as the state-of-the-art for list-decoding Reed--Solomon (RS) codes up to the Johnson bound against adversarial errors. However, some recent structural results on the combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed--Solomon codes suggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS codes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding adversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors. This error model bridges between fully random errors and fully adversarial errors by allowing some symbols of a message to be corrupted by an adversary while others are replaced with uniformly random symbols.
  As our main quest, we seek to understand optimal efficient unique decoding algorithms in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, we revisit some classical results on decoding interleaved Reed--Solomon codes (aka subfield evaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher--Kiayias--Yung (BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis. First, we give an improved implementation and analysis of the BKY algorithm for interleaved Reed--Solomon codes in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, our algorithm runs in near-linear time, and for most mixtures of random and adversarial errors, our analysis matches the information-theoretic optimum.
  Moreover, inspired by the BKY algorithm, we use a novel interpolation to extend our approach to the settings of folded Reed--Solomon and multiplicity codes, resulting in fast algorithms for unique decoding against semi-adversarial errors. A particular advantage of our near-linear time algorithm over state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for adversarial errors is that its running time depends only on a polynomial function of the folding parameter rather than on an exponential function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified optimization framework for designing continuous and discrete noise distributions that ensure differential privacy (DP) by minimizing R\'enyi DP, a variant of DP, under a cost constraint. R\'enyi DP has the advantage that by considering different values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, we can tailor our optimization for any number of compositions. To solve the optimization problem, we reduce it to a finite-dimensional convex formulation and perform preconditioned gradient descent. The resulting noise distributions are then compared to their Gaussian and Laplace counterparts. Numerical results demonstrate that our optimized distributions are consistently better, with significant improvements in $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees in the moderate composition regimes, compared to Gaussian and Laplace distributions with the same variance.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limits on general far-from-equilibrium molecular templating networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells produce RNA and proteins via molecular templating networks. We show that information transmission in such networks is bounded by functions of a simple thermodynamic property of the network, regardless of complexity. Surprisingly, putative systems operating at this bound do not have a high flux around the network. Instead, they have low entropy production, with each product in a ``pseudo-equilibrium'' determined by a single pathway. These pseudo-equilibrium limits constrain information transmission for the overall network, even if individual templates are arbitrarily specific.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scheduling for Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications Enhanced Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the computing and sensing capabilities of vehicles, vehicular federated learning (VFL) has been applied to edge training for connected vehicles. The dynamic and interconnected nature of vehicular networks presents unique opportunities to harness direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, enhancing VFL training efficiency. In this paper, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to optimize the VFL training performance, considering the energy constraints and mobility of vehicles, and propose a V2V-enhanced dynamic scheduling (VEDS) algorithm to solve it. The model aggregation requirements of VFL and the limited transmission time due to mobility result in a stepwise objective function, which presents challenges in solving the problem. We thus propose a derivative-based drift-plus-penalty method to convert the long-term stochastic optimization problem to an online mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, and provide a theoretical analysis to bound the performance gap between the online solution and the offline optimal solution. Further analysis of the scheduling priority reduces the original problem into a set of convex optimization problems, which are efficiently solved using the interior-point method. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed algorithm enhances the image classification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by 4.20% and reduces the average displacement errors on the Argoverse trajectory prediction dataset by 9.82%.</description>

      <title>Generalization and Robustness of the Tilted Empirical Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalization error (risk) of a supervised statistical learning algorithm quantifies its prediction ability on previously unseen data. Inspired by exponential tilting, \citet{li2020tilted} proposed the {\it tilted empirical risk} (TER) as a non-linear risk metric for machine learning applications such as classification and regression problems. In this work, we examine the generalization error of the tilted empirical risk in the robustness regime under \textit{negative tilt}. Our first contribution is to provide uniform and information-theoretic bounds on the {\it tilted generalization error}, defined as the difference between the population risk and the tilted empirical risk, under negative tilt for unbounded loss function under bounded $(1+\epsilon)$-th moment of loss function for some $\epsilon\in(0,1]$ with a convergence rate of $O(n^{-\epsilon/(1+\epsilon)})$ where $n$ is the number of training samples, revealing a novel application for TER under no distribution shift. Secondly, we study the robustness of the tilted empirical risk with respect to noisy outliers at training time and provide theoretical guarantees under distribution shift for the tilted empirical risk. We empirically corroborate our findings in simple experimental setups where we evaluate our bounds to select the value of tilt in a data-driven manner.</description>

      <title>Energy-and Spectral-Efficiency Trade-off in Distributed Massive-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01271v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet under-explored trade-off between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) in distributed massive MIMO (D-mMIMO) systems. Unlike conventional EE-SE trade-off studies that primarily focus on transmission power, D-mMIMO systems introduce new energy consumption factors including fronthaul signaling and distributed signal processing, which are heavily influenced by AP-UE association. This work highlights the critical need for a system-level EE-SE trade-off framework that accounts for these unique aspects of D-mMIMO. We formulate a joint optimization problem that maximizes EE while satisfying uplink sum-SE constraints, through the coordinated design of power allocation and AP-UE association strategies. By explicitly considering both transmission and infrastructure-related energy costs, our approach enables energy-aware network design without compromising throughput. Numerical simulations demonstrate the substantial impact of dynamic AP-UE association and power control on the EE-SE trade-off, providing actionable insights for an efficient deployment of large-scale distributed MIMO networks in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Shuffling Cards When You Are of Very Little Brain: Low Memory Generation of Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we generate a permutation of the numbers $1$ through $n$ so that it is hard to guess the next element given the history so far? The twist is that the generator of the permutation (the ``Dealer") has limited memory, while the ``Guesser" has unlimited memory. With unbounded memory (actually $n$ bits suffice), the Dealer can generate a truly random permutation where $\ln n$ is the expected number of correct guesses.
  Our main results establish tight bounds for the relationship between the guessing probability and the memory $m$ required to generate the permutation. We suggest a method for an $m$-bit Dealer that operates in constant time per turn, and any Guesser can pick correctly only $O(n/m+\log m)$ cards in expectation. The method is fully transparent, requiring no hidden information from the Dealer (i.e., it is "open book" or "whitebox").
  We show that this bound is the best possible, even with secret memory. Specifically, for any $m$-bit Dealer, there is a (computationally powerful) guesser that achieves $\Omega(n/m+\log m)$ correct guesses in expectation. We point out that the assumption that the Guesser is computationally powerful is necessary: under cryptographic assumptions, there exists a low-memory Dealer that can fool any computationally bounded guesser.
  We also give an $O(n)$ bit memory Dealer that generates perfectly random permutations and operates in constant time per turn.</description>

      <title>Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Optimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.</description>
