      <title>A Fast Newton Method Under Local Lipschitz Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new, fast second-order method is proposed that achieves the optimal
  $\mathcal{O}\left(|\log(\epsilon)|\epsilon^{-3/2}\right)$
  complexity to obtain first-order $\epsilon$-stationary points.
  Crucially, this is deduced without assuming the
  standard global Lipschitz Hessian continuity condition, but only
  using an appropriate local smoothness requirement. The algorithm
  exploits Hessian information to compute a Newton step and a negative
  curvature step when needed, in an approach similar to that of the AN2C method.
  Inexact versions of the Newton step and negative curvature are
  proposed in order to reduce the cost of evaluating second-order information.
  Details are given of such an iterative implementation using Krylov subspaces.
  An extended algorithm for finding second-order
  critical points is also developed and its complexity is again shown
  to be within a log factor of the optimal one.
  Initial numerical experiments are discussed for both factorised
  and Krylov variants, which demonstrate the competitiveness of the
  proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Semi-Explicit Solution of Some Discrete-Time Mean-Field-Type Games with Higher-Order Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional solvable game theory and mean-field-type game theory (risk-aware games) predominantly focus on quadratic costs due to their analytical tractability. Nevertheless, they often fail to capture critical non-linearities inherent in real-world systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for solving discrete-time game problems with higher-order state and strategy costs involving power-law terms. We derive semi-explicit expressions for equilibrium strategies, cost-to-go functions, and recursive coefficient dynamics across deterministic, stochastic, and multi-agent system settings by convex-completion techniques. The contributions include variance-aware solutions under additive and multiplicative noise, extensions to mean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and conditions that ensure the positivity of recursive coefficients. Our results provide a foundational methodology for analyzing non linear multi-agent systems under higher-order penalization, bridging classical game theory and mean-field-type game theory with modern computational tools for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of an inverse coefficients problem in a system of partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we address the inverse problem of recovering the Lam\'e parameters ($\lambda, \mu$) and the density $\rho$ of a medium from the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map for any dimension $d\geq 2$. This inverse problem finds its motivation in the reconstruction of mechanical properties of tissues in medical diagnostics. We first assume that the Lam\'e parameters ($\lambda, \mu$) are know and we look for the inverse problem of recovering the density $\rho$. In this context, we derive a constrcutive Lipschitz stability estimate in terms of the Neumann to Dirichlet map in the case of piecewise constant parameters. Then, we look for the inverse problem of recovering $\lambda$, $\mu$ and $\rho$ simultameousely.
  We establish Lipschitz stability estimate, provided that the parameters $\lambda$, $\mu$ and $\rho$ have upper and lower bounds and belong to a known finite-dimensional subspace. The proofs hinge on monotonicity relations between the parameters and the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, coupled with the techniques of localized potentials.</description>

      <title>On exactness of semidefinite programming relaxation for the maximum cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semidefinite programming provides a relaxation of the maximum cut problem on a graph. We investigate and present a few classes of graphs for which the semidefinite relaxation of the maximum cut problem is exact. For each of these classes, we determine the optimal objective value by explicitly constructing a maximum cut. Furthermore, we prove the uniqueness of the exact solution for two of these graph classes.</description>

      <title>ICNN-enhanced 2SP: Leveraging input convex neural networks for solving two-stage stochastic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</description>

      <title>The Ergodic Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control Problems for Stochastic Mean-Field Systems with Periodic Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the ergodic linear-quadratic closed-loop optimal control problems, in which the state equation is the mean-field stochastic differential equation with periodic coefficients. We first study the asymptotic behavior of the solution to the state equation and get a family of periodic measures depending on time variables within a period from the convergence of transition probabilities. Then, with the help of periodic measures and periodic Riccati equations, we transform the ergodic cost functional on infinite horizon into an equivalent cost functional on a single periodic interval without limit, and present the closed-loop optimal controls for our concerned control system. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Repair Crew Routing for Infrastructure Network Restoration under Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a disrupted infrastructure network where the repair crew knows the locations of service outages but not the locations of actual faults. Our goal is to determine a route for a single crew to visit and repair the disruptions to restore service with minimum negative impact. We call this problem the Traveling Repairman Network Restoration Problem (TRNRP). This problem presents strong computational challenges due to the combinatorial nature of the decisions, inter-dependencies within the underlying infrastructure network, and incomplete information. Considering the dynamic nature of the decisions as a result of dynamic information revelation on the status of the nodes, we model this problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. Our solution approach uses value approximation based on reinforcement learning, which is strengthened by structural results that identify a set of suboptimal moves. In addition, we propose state aggregation methods to reduce the size of the state space. We perform extensive computational studies to characterize the performance of our solution methods under different parameter settings and to compare them with benchmark solution approaches.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Drop-Off Locations and Pickup Routes: A Budget-Constrained Routing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce in this paper a new variant of a location routing problem, to decide, the number and location of drop-off points to install based on the demands of a set of pick-up points, according to a given set-up budget for installing drop-off points. A single vehicle is in charge for all pick-up and drop-off operations, and the solution cost is associated with its route, which must also be decided. We provide a general and flexible mathematical optimization based approach for solving the problem that has some peculiarities to assure that the demand is adequately picked up, that some pickup points can be visited multiple times, that the capacity of the vehicle is respected, or that the vehicle is capable to implement the path or tour in the obtained solution. We report the results of a extense battery of experiments to validate our proposal on synthetic instances, and provide some insighs on the usefulness of our approach in practical applications.</description>

      <title>An efficient second-order cone programming approach for dynamic optimal transport on staggered grid discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient numerical method based on second-order cone programming (SOCP) to solve dynamic optimal transport (DOT) problems with quadratic cost on staggered grid discretization. By properly reformulating discretized DOT problems into a linear SOCP, the proposed method eliminates the interpolation matrices and thus avoids solving a series of cubic equations and linear systems induced by interpolation. Then, by taking advantage of the SOCP reformulation, we can solve them efficiently by a computationally highly economical implementation of an inexact decomposition-based proximal augmented Lagrangian method. Moreover, we have made the proposed approach an open-source software package. Numerical experiments on various DOT problems suggest that the proposed approach performs significantly more efficiently than state-of-the-art software packages. In addition, it exhibits prominent robustness to problems with non-negative measures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a numerical analysis of the strong stabilization and polynomial decay of solutions for the initial boundary value problem associated with a system that models the dynamics of a mixture of two rigid solids with porosity. This mathematical model accounts for the complex interactions between the rigid components and their porous structure, providing valuable information on the mechanical behavior of such systems. Our primary objective is to establish conditions under which stabilization is ensured and to rigorously quantify the rate of decay of the solutions. Using numerical simulations, we assess the effectiveness of different stabilization mechanisms and analyze the influence of key system parameters on the overall dynamics.</description>

      <title>Primal-dual algorithm for contextual stochastic combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to contextual stochastic optimization, integrating operations research and machine learning to address decision-making under uncertainty. Traditional methods often fail to leverage contextual information, which underscores the necessity for new algorithms. In this study, we utilize neural networks with combinatorial optimization layers to encode policies. Our goal is to minimize the empirical risk, which is estimated from past data on uncertain parameters and contexts. To that end, we present a surrogate learning problem and a generic primal-dual algorithm that is applicable to various combinatorial settings in stochastic optimization. Our approach extends classic Fenchel-Young loss results and introduces a new regularization method using sparse perturbations on the distribution simplex. This allows for tractable updates in the original space and can accommodate diverse objective functions. We demonstrate the linear convergence of our algorithm under certain conditions and provide a bound on the non-optimality of the resulting policy in terms of the empirical risk. Experiments on a contextual stochastic minimum weight spanning tree problem show that our algorithm is efficient and scalable, achieving performance comparable to imitation learning of solutions computed using an expensive Lagrangian-based heuristic.</description>

      <title>Convergent Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Methods for Gradient-Driven Denoisers in Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS) MRI, model-based methods are pivotal to achieving accurate reconstruction. One of the main challenges in model-based methods is finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the target image. Plug-and-Play (PnP) and REgularization by Denoising (RED) are two general frameworks that use denoisers as the prior. While PnP/RED methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical hand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions that do not hold for practical CNNs. The recently developed gradient-driven denoisers offer a framework that bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees. However, the numerical solvers for the associated minimization problem remain slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton proximal method that achieves faster convergence than existing approaches. To address the complex domain in CS MRI, we propose a modified Hessian estimation method that guarantees Hermitian positive definiteness. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method for nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Precise gradient descent training dynamics for finite-width multi-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.
  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF) theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.
  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning. As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear combination of the true signal and the initialization.</description>

      <title>Randomized Routing to Remote Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study load balancing for a queueing system where parallel stations are distant from customers. In the presence of traveling delays, the join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy induces queue length oscillations and prolongs the mean waiting time. A variant of the JSQ policy, dubbed the randomized join-the-shortest-queue (RJSQ) policy, is devised to mitigate the oscillation phenomenon. By the RJSQ policy, customers are sent to each station with a probability approximately proportional to its service capacity; only a small fraction of customers are purposely routed to the shortest queue. The additional probability of routing a customer to the shortest queue, referred to as the balancing fraction, dictates the policy's performance. When the balancing fraction is within a certain range, load imbalance between the stations is negligible in heavy traffic, so that complete resource pooling is achieved. We specify the optimal order of magnitude for the balancing fraction, by which heuristic formulas are proposed to fine-tune the RJSQ policy. A joint problem of capacity planning and load balancing is considered for geographically separated stations. With well planned service capacities, the RJSQ policy sends all but a small fraction of customers to the nearest stations, rendering the system asymptotically equivalent to an aggregated single-server system with all customers having minimum traveling delays. If each customer's service requirement does not depend on the station, the RJSQ policy is asymptotically optimal for reducing workload.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Stochastic Clock Jitter Compensation in Analog-to-Digital Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and compensation of stochastic discrete time clock jitter in Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Two novel, computationally efficient de-jittering sample pilots-based algorithms for baseband signals are proposed: one consisting in solving a sequence of weighted least-squares problems and another that fully leverages the correlated jitter structure in a Kalman filter-type routine. Alongside, a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical analysis of the linearization errors committed is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic simulations and performance benchmarking with the scope of gauging and stress-testing the techniques in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Operator-Level Quantum Acceleration of Non-Logconcave Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to the Poincar\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from complex, rugged energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective optimisation via the R2 utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of multi-objective optimisation is to identify a collection of points which describe the best possible trade-offs between the multiple objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the moment-SoS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing convergence rates for infinite dimensional linear programming problems (LPs) within the context of the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy. Our primary focus is on extending the existing convergence rate analysis, initially developed for static polynomial optimization, to the more general and challenging domain of the generalized moment problem. We establish an easy-to-follow procedure for obtaining convergence rates. Our methodology is based on, firstly, a state-of-the-art degree bound for Putinar's Positivstellensatz, secondly, quantitative polynomial approximation bounds, and, thirdly, a geometric Slater condition on the infinite dimensional LP. We address a broad problem formulation that encompasses various applications, such as optimal control, volume computation, and exit location of stochastic processes. We illustrate the procedure at these three problems and, using a recent improvement on effective versions of Putinar's Positivstellensatz, we improve existing convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dual Conic Proxy for Semidefinite Relaxation of AC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear, non-convex AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is fundamental for power systems operations. The intrinsic complexity of AC-OPF has fueled a growing interest in the development of optimization proxies for the problem, i.e., machine learning models that predict high-quality, close-to-optimal solutions. More recently, dual conic proxy architectures have been proposed, which combine machine learning and convex relaxations of AC-OPF, to provide valid certificates of optimality using learning-based methods. Building on this methodology, this paper proposes, for the first time, a dual conic proxy architecture for the semidefinite (SDP) relaxation of AC-OPF problems. Although the SDP relaxation is stronger than the second-order cone relaxation considered in previous work, its practical use has been hindered by its computational cost. The proposed method combines a neural network with a differentiable dual completion strategy that leverages the structure of the dual SDP problem. This approach guarantees dual feasibility, and therefore valid dual bounds, while providing orders of magnitude of speedups compared to interior-point algorithms. The paper also leverages self-supervised learning, which alleviates the need for time-consuming data generation and allows to train the proposed models efficiently. Numerical experiments are presented on several power grid benchmarks with up to 500 buses. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDP-based proxies can outperform weaker conic relaxations, while providing several orders of magnitude speedups compared to a state-of-the-art interior-point SDP solver.</description>

      <title>Proximal Gradient Dynamics and Feedback Control for Equality-Constrained Composite Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies equality-constrained composite minimization problems. This class of problems, capturing regularization terms and convex inequality constraints, naturally arises in a wide range of engineering and machine learning applications. To tackle these minimization problems, we introduce the \emph{proportional--integral proximal gradient dynamics} (PI--PGD): a closed-loop system where the Lagrange multipliers are control inputs and states are the problem decision variables. First, we establish the equivalence between the minima of the optimization problem and the equilibria of the PI--PGD. Then {for the case of affine constraints}, {by} leveraging tools from contraction theory we give a comprehensive convergence analysis for the dynamics, showing linear--exponential convergence towards the equilibrium. That is, the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. Our findings are illustrated numerically on a set of representative examples, which include an application to entropy-regularized optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Optimal protection and vaccination against epidemics with reinfection risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of the optimal allocation of vaccination and protection measures for the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected (SIRI) epidemiological model, which generalizes the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological models by allowing for reinfection. First, we introduce the controlled SIRI dynamical model, and discuss the existence and stability of the equilibrium points. Then, we formulate a finite-horizon optimal control problem where the cost of vaccination and protection is proportional to the mass of the population that adopts it. Our main contribution in this work arises from a detailed investigation into the existence/non-existence of singular control inputs, and establishing optimality of bang-bang controls. The optimality of bang-bang control is established by solving an optimal control problem with a running cost that is linear with respect to the input variables. The input variables are associated with actions including the vaccination and imposition of protective measures (e.g., masking or isolation). In contrast to most prior works, we rigorously establish the non-existence of singular controls (i.e., the optimality of bang-bang control for our SIRI model). Under the assumption that the reinfection rate exceeds the first-time infection rate, we characterize the structure of both the optimal control inputs, and establish that the vaccination control input admits a bang-bang structure. The numerical results provide valuable insights into the evolution of the disease spread under optimal control.</description>

      <title>Online Matching on $3$-Uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The online matching problem was introduced by Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani (STOC 1990) on bipartite graphs with vertex arrivals. It is well-known that the optimal competitive ratio is $1-1/e$ for both integral and fractional versions of the problem. Since then, there has been considerable effort to find optimal competitive ratios for other related settings. In this work, we go beyond the graph case and study the online matching problem on $k$-uniform hypergraphs. For $k=3$, we provide an optimal primal-dual fractional algorithm, which achieves a competitive ratio of $(e-1)/(e+1)\approx 0.4621$. As our main technical contribution, we present a carefully constructed adversarial instance, which shows that this ratio is in fact optimal. It combines ideas from known hard instances for bipartite graphs under the edge-arrival and vertex-arrival models. For $k\geq 3$, we give a simple integral algorithm which performs better than greedy when the online nodes have bounded degree. As a corollary, it achieves the optimal competitive ratio of 1/2 on 3-uniform hypergraphs when every online node has degree at most 2. This is because the special case where every online node has degree 1 is equivalent to the edge-arrival model on graphs, for which an upper bound of 1/2 is known.</description>

      <title>Learning stochastic dynamics from snapshots through regularized unbalanced optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability.</description>

      <title>Effective Dimension Aware Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent for Convex Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional-order stochastic gradient descent (FOSGD) leverages fractional exponents to capture long-memory effects in optimization. However, its utility is often limited by the difficulty of tuning and stabilizing these exponents. We propose 2SED Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (2SEDFOSGD), which integrates the Two-Scale Effective Dimension (2SED) algorithm with FOSGD to adapt the fractional exponent in a data-driven manner. By tracking model sensitivity and effective dimensionality, 2SEDFOSGD dynamically modulates the exponent to mitigate oscillations and hasten convergence. Theoretically, this approach preserves the advantages of fractional memory without the sluggish or unstable behavior observed in na\"ive fractional SGD. Empirical evaluations in Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable noise scenarios using an autoregressive (AR) model\textcolor{red}{, as well as on the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets for image classification,} highlight faster convergence and more robust parameter estimates compared to baseline methods, underscoring the potential of dimension-aware fractional techniques for advanced modeling and estimation tasks.</description>
