      <title>On the Role of Color Temperature and Color Rendering Index of White-Light LEDs on the Theoretical Efficiency Limit of Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, the demand for sustainable indoor power sources is increasing. Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which are currently in development, present a renewable solution but need to be designed to match specific light sources. While previous studies have emphasized the role of white-light LED color temperature (CT) in determining IPV efficiency and optimum bandgap energy, the role of color rendering index (CRI) remains less understood. In this study, we employ detailed-balance calculations to assess the theoretical maximum efficiency and optimal bandgap energies of IPVs under commercial white-light LED irradiance varying in both CT (2200 K to 6500 K) and CRI (70, 80, and 90). Our results confirm that lower CTs indeed yield higher efficiencies and lower optimal bandgaps. However, contrary to prior assumptions that CRI has negligible impact on IPV material choice and performance, we demonstrate that high-CRI LEDs necessitate the use of materials with significantly lower bandgap energies for optimum efficiency. We also evaluate the performance of various IPVs at fixed bandgaps, revealing that while optimal IPV performance is achieved with wide-bandgap materials under lower CRI lighting, mature technologies like silicon and CdTe benefit from high-CRI illumination. These findings underscore the need to consider both CT and CRI in the design and evaluation of IPVs for indoor IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Measurements, simulations, and models of the point-spread function of electron-beam lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a sample is exposed using electron-beam lithography, the electrons scatter deep and far in the substrate, resulting in unwanted deposition of dose at both the nano- and the microscale. This proximity effect can be mitigated by proximity effect correction provided that accurate and validated models of the point-spread function of the electron scattering are available. Most works so far considered a double-Gaussian model of the electron point-spread function, which is very inaccurate for modern electron-beam writers with high acceleration voltages. We present measurements of the process point-spread function for chemically semi-amplified resist on silicon and indium phosphide substrates using a 150 kV electron-beam lithography system. We find that the double-Gaussian model deviates from experiments by up to four orders of magnitude. We propose instead a model comprising the sum of a power-law and a Gaussian, which is in excellent agreement with simulations of the electron scattering obtained by a Monte Carlo method. We apply the power-law plus Gaussian model to quantify the electron scattering and proximity effect correction parameters across material stacks, processing, and voltages from 5 kV to 150 kV. We find that the power-law term remains remarkably constant, whereas the long-range dose contributions and the clearing dose are significantly affected by the substrate and the acceleration voltage.</description>

      <title>Pull-off strength of mushroom-shaped fibrils adhered to rigid substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptional adhesion properties of biological fibrillar structures -- such as those found in geckos -- have inspired the development of synthetic adhesive surfaces. Among these, mushroom-shaped fibrils have demonstrated superior pull-off strength compared to other geometries. In this study, we employ a computational approach based on a Dugdale cohesive zone model to analyze the detachment behavior of these fibrils when adhered to a rigid substrate. The results provide complete pull-off curves, revealing that the separation process is inherently unstable under load control, regardless of whether detachment initiates at the fibril edge or center. Our findings show that fibrils with a wide, thin mushroom cap effectively reduce stress concentrations and promote central detachment, leading to enhanced adhesion. However, detachment from the center is not observed in all geometries, whereas edge detachment can occur under certain conditions in all cases. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adhesion defects at the fibril center, showing that they can significantly reduce pull-off strength, particularly at high values of the dimensionless parameter \c{hi}. These insights contribute to the optimization of bio-inspired adhesives and microstructured surfaces for various engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A generalised framework for phase field-based modelling of coupled problems: application to thermo-mechanical fracture, hydraulic fracture, hydrogen embrittlement and corrosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, generalised formulation to treat coupled structural integrity problems by combining phase field and multi-physics modelling. The approach exploits the versatility of the heat transfer equation and is therefore well suited to be adopted in commercial finite element packages, requiring only integration point-level implementation. This aspect is demonstrated here by implementing coupled, multi-variable phenomena through simple \texttt{UMAT} and \texttt{UMATHT} subroutines in the finite element package \texttt{Abaqus}. The generalised theoretical and computational framework presented is particularised to four problems of engineering and scientific relevance: thermo-mechanical fracture, hydraulic fracture, hydrogen-assisted cracking and metallic corrosion. 2D and 3D problems are considered. The results reveal a very good agreement with experimental data, and existing numerical and analytical solutions.The user subroutines developed are made freely available at https://mechmat.web.ox.ac.uk/codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that electromagnetic constitutive relations of materials, defined by a scalar permittivity, $\varepsilon$, and permeability, $\mu$, are the same for all inertial observers provided that $\varepsilon\mu = 1$ is satisfied. To highlight the practical power of our general result, we discuss schemes in which this property plays a significant role, such as Fresnel-Fizeau optical drag or modified Snell's law for moving dielectrics. We also proof that such a particular behavior can be extended to systems like uniaxial anisotropic media or negative refractive index metamaterials.</description>

      <title>An Imaging Radar Using a Rydberg Atom Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in a gas form are highly sensitive electric field probes capable of detecting and measuring the amplitude, phase, and polarization of broadband time-varying signals. Here, we present the performance of a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar using a Rydberg atom-based subwavelength sensor as a receiver. This sensor down converts the radar echoes, eliminates key FMCW electrical components, and performs two-dimensional target localization. To demonstrate its capabilities, we present an RF image of a scene containing targets in an anechoic room with radar cross sections down to 0 dBsm at a distance up to 5 m and with a range resolution of 4.7 cm.</description>

      <title>300 mm Wafer-Scale SiN Platform for Broadband Soliton Microcombs Compatible with Alkali Atomic References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chip-integrated optical frequency combs (OFCs) based on Kerr nonlinear resonators are of great significance given their scalability and wide range of applications. Broadband on-chip OFCs reaching visible wavelengths are especially valuable as they address atomic clock transitions that play an important role in position, navigation, and timing infrastructure. Silicon nitride (SiN) deposited via low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is the usual platform for the fabrication of chip-integrated OFCs, and such fabrication is now standard at wafer sizes up to 200 mm. However, the LPCVD high temperature and film stress poses challenges in scaling to larger wafers and integration with electronic and photonic devices. Here, we report the linear performance and broadband frequency comb generation from microring resonators fabricated on 300 mm wafers at AIM Photonics, using a lower temperature, lower stress plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process that is suitable for thick ($\approx$ 700 nm) SiN films and compatible with electronic and photonic integration. The platform exhibits consistent insertion loss, high intrinsic quality factor, and thickness variation of $\pm$2 % across the whole 300 mm wafer. We demonstrate broadband soliton microcomb generation with a lithographically tunable dispersion profile extending to wavelengths relevant to common alkali atom transitions. These results are a step towards mass-manufacturable devices that integrate OFCs with electronic and active photonic components, enabling advanced applications including optical clocks, LiDAR, and beyond.</description>

      <title>All-electric control of skyrmion-bimeron transition in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a versatile platform for manipulating atomic-scale topological spin textures. In this study, using first-principles and micromagnetic calculations, we demonstrate a reversible transition between magnetic skyrmions and bimerons in a MoTeI/In_2Se_3 multiferroic heterostructure. The physical origin lies in the reorientation of the easy axis of magnetic anisotropy, triggered by the reversal of ferroelectric polarization. We show that the transition operates effectively under both static and dynamic conditions, exhibiting remarkable stability and flexibility. Notably, this transition can be achieved entirely through electric control, without requiring any external magnetic field. Furthermore, we propose a binary encoding scheme based on the skyrmion-bimeron transition, presenting a promising path toward energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic and Thermoelectric Properties of Molecular Junctions Incorporating Organometallic Complexes: Implications for Thermoelectric Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic and thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions formed from iron and ruthenium metal-acetylide were studied using complementary experimental techniques and quantum chemical simulations. We performed physical characterizations of single-molecule and self-assembled monolayer junctions of the same molecules that allowed meaningful comparisons between the Ru and Fe adducts. In the case of the Fe-containing junctions, two distinct oxidation states are present. These junctions exhibit one of the highest Seebeck coefficients (S ca. 130 {\mu}V/K) reported to date for similar systems paired with broad electric conductance distribution and limited thermal conductance. As a result, the experimental thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for Fe-containing junctions reaches up to 0.4 for junctions with relatively high conductance. This is one of the highest ZT values reported for molecular systems at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Tunable bound states in the continuum through hybridization of 1D and 2D metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to create and dynamically control quasi-Bound States in the Continuum (BIC) resonances through the hybridization of 1D and 2D metasurfaces using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). By introducing out-of-plane symmetry breaking through a silicon MEMS membrane positioned above a 1D silicon metasurface, the quasi-BIC resonance's central wavelength and quality factor are precisely tuned. The proposed design achieves ultranarrow resonance linewidths with the spectral tuning range exceeding 60 nm while maintaining a constant quality factor. This tuning capability, realized through both horizontal displacement within a 1D metasurface and vertical MEMS membrane movement, offers a new degree of freedom for manipulating quasi-BIC resonances. The proposed hybridization of 2D and 1D metasurfaces using MEMS mechanism provides a practical route to dynamic modulation of transmission resonance characteristics, making it a promising candidate for tunable filters, spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent spin transport phenomena in magnetic heterostructures under alternating currents (AC), advancing the relatively underdeveloped field of alternating spintronics. Employing a time-dependent spin diffusion model, we show that the interplay of AC frequencies and spin relaxation times reveals significant differences in spin accumulation patterns compared to conventional direct current (DC) scenarios. Of particular interest is the emergence of capacitive-like impedance in a spin valve under AC conditions, which is especially pronounced in antiparallel spin configurations. These findings open up possibilities for developing high-frequency spintronic devices, including the proposed "spin resonator", which functions like a standard LC resonator but without a traditional capacitor.</description>

      <title>Generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in monolithic photonic waveguides by leveraging intrinsic crystal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced photonic quantum technologies -- from quantum key distribution to quantum computing -- require on-chip sources of entangled photons that are both efficient and readily scalable. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in structurally simple waveguides by exploiting the intrinsic properties of nonlinear crystals. We thereby circumvent elaborate phase-matching strategies that commonly involve the spatial modulation of a waveguide's linear or nonlinear optical properties. We derive general criteria for the second-order susceptibility tensor that enable the generation of cross-polarized photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in single-material waveguides. Based on these criteria, we systematically categorize all birefringent, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes in terms of their suitability. Using coupled mode theory, we then numerically analyze cuboid waveguides made from two materials that are highly relevant to integrated photonics: lithium niobate, a well-established platform, and barium titanate, an emerging alternative. We find that barium titanate consistently outperforms lithium niobate by providing a higher nonlinear efficiency and high concurrence over a significantly broader spectral range. These findings outline a practical route toward highly efficient, fabrication-friendly, and scalable sources of polarization-entangled photons for integrated quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Anomalous refractive index modulation and giant birefringence in 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D ferroelectric (FE) materials have opened new opportunities in non-volatile memories, computation and non-linear optics due to their robust polarization in the ultra-thin limit and inherent flexibility in device integration. Recently, interest has grown in the use of 2D FEs in electro-optics, demanding the exploration of their electronic and optical properties. In this work, we report the discovery of an unprecedented anomalous thickness-dependent change in refractive index, as large as $\delta n$ $\sim$ 23.2$\%$, in the 2D ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$, far above the ultra-thin limit, and at room temperature. Additionally, we observe a giant birefringence in the blue-ultraviolet regime, with a maximum $\vert n_{OOP} - n_{IP}\vert$ $\sim$ 1.24 at $t \sim$ 22 nm and $\lambda$ = 339.5 nm. We relate changes in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ optical constants to changes in the Cu(I) FE polarization contribution, influenced by its ionic mobility, opening the door to electronic control of its optical response for use in photonics and electro-optics.</description>

      <title>Spatial Filtering with Nonlocal Non-Hermitian Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial filtering of optical fields has widespread applications ranging from beam shaping to optical information processing. However, conventional spatial filters are bulky and alignment-sensitive. Here, we present nonlocal non-Hermitian metasurfaces that can act as exceptionally effective optical spatial filters while being highly compact and insensitive to both lateral and longitudinal displacements. The metasurface design is based on a resonant waveguide grating in which radiative losses of the modes are tailored to realize a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum in the middle of a non-Hermitian flat band. Using this design, we propose a compact spatial filtering device operating over an angular range of approximately 1 degree around normal incidence. In addition to being ultrathin and robust against translational misalignment, the proposed metasurfaces are easy to manufacture, which makes them an attractive alternative to conventional spatial filters, holding a potential to become a widely used optical component.</description>

Abstract: Advancing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology into the sub-1-nm angstr\"om-scale technology nodes is expected to involve alternative semiconductor channel materials, as silicon transistors encounter severe performance degradation at physical gate lengths below 10 nm. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for overcoming short-channel effects due to their atomically thin bodies, which inherently suppress electrostatic leakage and improve gate control in aggressively scaled field-effect transistors (FETs). Among the growing library of 2D materials, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family -- a synthetic septuple-layered materials -- has attracted increasing attention for its remarkable ambient stability, suitable bandgaps, and favorable carrier transport characteristics, making it a promising platform for next-generation transistors. While experimental realization of sub-10-nm 2D FETs remains technologically demanding, computational device simulation using first-principles density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function transport simulations provide a powerful and cost-effective route for exploring the performance limits and optimal design of ultrascaled FET. This review consolidates the current progress in the computational design of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. We review the physical properties of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ that makes them compelling candidates for transistor applications, as well as the simulated device performance and optimization strategy of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. Finally, we identify key challenges and research gaps, and outline future directions that could accelerate the practical deployment of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FET in the angstr\"om-scale CMOS era.</description>

      <title>Mechanically Reconfigurable GRIN Lens Concept for Focusing and Beamforming Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a prospective concept of a mechanically reconfigurable Gradient Index (GRIN) lens for focusing and beamforming applications. The lens is formed by corrugated layers, each realizing a refractive index profile expressed in a basis of Chebyshev polynomials. The focal point position is controlled by shifting the GRIN lens layers. A geometrical optics-based approach is implemented for the three scenarios of focusing at varying focal distance. The geometrical optics results are validated by numerical simulations, with some discrepancies observed due to modeling approximations and structural granularity. We also discuss scalability of the proposed concept for operation at infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Plasmonically Enhanced Flexural-Mode AlScN Nanoplate Resonator as Uncooled and Ultrafast IR Detector with High Responsivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel class of miniaturized, uncooled, and ultra-fast infrared (IR) resonant thermal detectors (RTDs) based on 30%-doped Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) nanoplates. Exploiting high electromechanical coupling, good thermal properties, and enhanced and selective IR absorption, the presented device aims to demonstrate significant advancements over the state-of-the-art IR RTDs. This single pixel combines compact footprint, high spectral selectivity and responsivity, reduced noise, and fast thermal response, allowing for the potential development of innovative IR thermal imagers through multi-pixel integration. The flexural nature of the actuated resonance mode eventually enables an interferometric optical readout, paving the way towards achieving extremely low Noise Equivalent Power levels. These results demonstrate a high IR responsivity of around 130 ppt/pW, a thermal time constant of around 330 us, and a large out-of-plane displacement. This work represents the first experimental integration on a resonating platform of plasmonic absorbers that utilize AlScN as dielectric layer.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of localization effects in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>

Abstract: Anderson localization and the non-Hermitian skin effect are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are driven, respectively, by disorder and nonreciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate a delocalization-localization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between Anderson localization and the skin effect can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate that quantum jumps between the skin states and the Anderson-localized states occur in the theoretical model. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The voltage profile of the circuit exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the skin effect, while the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the circuit can be perceived via a predicted localization behavior near the excitation node, rather than exhibiting sudden non-Hermitian jumps, as observed in the tight-binding framework. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the output voltage of the circuit. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits, opening avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic systems such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient devices for information transfer and communication.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser-written nano-ablations containing bright antibunched emitters on gallium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser-writing offers distinct capabilities for fabrication, including three-dimensional, multi-material, and sub-diffraction-limited patterning. In particular, demonstrations of laser-written quantum emitters and photonic devices with superior optical properties have attracted attention. Recently, gallium nitride (GaN) has been reported to host quantum emitters with narrow and bright zero-phonon photoluminescence from ultraviolet to telecom ranges. However, emitters formed during epitaxy are randomly positioned, and until now, it has not been possible to fabricate quantum emitters in ordered arrays. In this paper, we employ femtosecond laser writing to create nano-ablations with sub-diffraction-limited diameter, and use rapid thermal annealing to activate co-located stable emitters. The emitters show MHz antibunched emission with a sharp spectral peak at room temperature. Our study not only presents an efficient approach to laser-written nanofabrication on GaN but also offers a promising pathway for the deterministic creation of quantum emitters in GaN, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved.</description>

      <title>Towards Navigation-Grade and Deployable Optomechanical Accelerometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and experimentally demonstrate an architecture for achieving navigation-grade, fiber-packaged optomechanical accelerometers that can operate with a large dynamic range, over a wide temperature range, and without sophisticated laser sources. Our accelerometer architecture is based on a novel set of design principles that take advantage of the strengths of optomechanical accelerometry while eliminating many of its historical weaknesses. Displacement readout is provided by an integrated, differential strain-sensing Mach-Zehnder interferometer (DSMZI) attached to an ultra-rigid, bulk-micromachined proof mass having a 93.4 kHz fundamental resonance frequency (22.5 pm/g displacement). Despite the extreme rigidity, the high displacement sensitivity provides an insertion loss limited 4.2 $\mu g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ acceleration resolution, with a straight-forward path to achieving 330 $n g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by improving the fiber-to-chip coupling. Further, we show that the combination of high rigidity and intrinsic differential optical readout makes the device insensitive to the common causes of bias instability, and we measure a bias instability of 6.3 $\mu g$ at 243 seconds. The DSMZI provides a 17 nm optical bandwidth and a temperature operating range of greater than 20 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, both orders of magnitude larger than previous demonstrations of optomechanical accelerometers. The high rigidity and large optical bandwidth yield an expected dynamic range of 165.4 dB. The combination of high acceleration resolution, high dynamic range, low bias instability, and intrinsic insensitivity to wavelength, temperature, and package stresses makes our device well suited for deployment in realistic environments demanded by real-world applications and demonstrates a path for optomechanical accelerometers to ultimately exceed the performance of all other chip-based accelerometers.</description>
