      <title>High-fidelity holographic beam shaping with optimal transport and phase diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) provides a powerful way to shape laser beams into arbitrary intensity patterns, but at the cost of a hard computational problem of determining an appropriate SLM phase. Here we show that optimal transport methods can generate approximate solutions to this problem that serve as excellent initializations for iterative phase retrieval algorithms, yielding vortex-free solutions with superior accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we show that analogous algorithms can be used to measure the intensity and phase of the input beam incident upon the SLM via phase diversity imaging. These techniques furnish flexible and convenient solutions to the computational challenges of beam shaping with an SLM.</description>

      <title>Performance Metrics and Loss Mechanisms in Horticulture Luminescent Solar Concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horticulture Luminescent Solar Concentrators (HLSCs) represent an innovative concept developed in recent years to promote crop yields, building upon the foundation of traditional Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs). HLSCs are characterized by two distinct properties: spectral conversion and light extraction. Unlike traditional LSCs, HLSCs focus on converting energy from one part of the solar spectrum (typically green) to a specific range (usually red) and aim for the converted photons to exit the device from the bottom surface rather than the edge surfaces. In this study, we start by examining the specific requirements of horticulture to clarify the motivation for using HLSCs. We re-evaluate and propose new optical metrics tailored to HLSCs. Additionally, we analyse potential loss channels for direct red emission and converted red emission. Utilizing Monte Carlo ray tracing method and experimental data, we further explore the factors influencing these loss channels. Our work provides a fundamental discussion on HLSCs and offers design guidelines for future HLSC research.</description>

      <title>Generating Grating in Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of magnomechanically induced grating (MMIG) within a cavity magnomechanical system, comprising magnons (spins in a ferromagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet), cavity microwave photons, and phonons [\textit{J. Li, S.-Y. Zhu, and G. S. Agarwal, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{121}, 203601 (2018)}]. By applying an external standing wave control, we observe modifications in the transmission profile of a probe light beam, signifying the presence of MMIG. Through numerical analysis, we explore the diffraction intensities of the probe field, examining the impact of interactions between cavity magnons, magnon-phonon interactions, standing wave field strength, and interaction length. MMIG systems leverage the unique properties of magnons, and collective spin excitations with attributes like long coherence times and spin-wave propagation. These distinctive features can be harnessed in MMIG systems for innovative applications in information storage, retrieval, and quantum memories, offering various orders of diffraction grating.</description>

      <title>Gain-Bandwidth-Product-Induced Technical Bound in Time Transfer System without Inline Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time transfer plays a dispensable role in many fields including navigation and positioning, geodesy, and fundamental tests. However, in certain scenarios where effective relay node deployment is often not feasible, such as harsh environments with extremely poor infrastructure and emergency conditions, effective time transfer without inline amplifiers becomes crucial. In this situation, the maximum transmission distance is limited by the receiver's measurement capability, particularly its ability to amplify the signal. Here we propose a theoretical model, giving a technical lower bound of the detected signal stability at different transmission distances, induced by limited gain-bandwidth products. The results under common gain-bandwidth products show that while for shorter transmission distances, stability is mainly limited by the background noise of the time interval counter, for longer distances reaching the scale of 300 kilometers, the technical lower bound is below the level of 10 nanoseconds without any inline amplification devices. Therefore, the given technical bound offers guidance on managing the balance between distance and stability, together with the optimization of the receiver in long-distance time transfer without inline amplification.</description>

      <title>Characterization of point-source transient events with a rolling-shutter compressed sensing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-source transient events (PSTEs) - optical events that are both extremely fast and extremely small - pose several challenges to an imaging system. Due to their speed, accurately characterizing such events often requires detectors with very high frame rates. Due to their size, accurately detecting such events requires maintaining coverage over an extended field-of-view, often through the use of imaging focal plane arrays (FPA) with a global shutter readout. Traditional imaging systems that meet these requirements are costly in terms of price, size, weight, power consumption, and data bandwidth, and there is a need for cheaper solutions with adequate temporal and spatial coverage. To address these issues, we develop a novel compressed sensing algorithm adapted to the rolling shutter readout of an imaging system. This approach enables reconstruction of a PSTE signature at the sampling rate of the rolling shutter, offering a 1-2 order of magnitude temporal speedup and a proportional reduction in data bandwidth. We present empirical results demonstrating accurate recovery of PSTEs using measurements that are spatially undersampled by a factor of 25, and our simulations show that, relative to other compressed sensing algorithms, our algorithm is both faster and yields higher quality reconstructions. We also present theoretical results characterizing our algorithm and corroborating simulations. The potential impact of our work includes the development of much faster, cheaper sensor solutions for PSTE detection and characterization.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering linear (Rayleigh) scattering of cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice, with respect to the resonator mode, the scattering can be suppressed by destructive interference: resulting in a subradiant atomic array. We show however, that strong coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strongly coupled vacuum mode induces polarization rotation in the linear scattering, which is incompatible with a linear polarizability model of isotropic objects.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamical Casimir effect and Unruh entanglement in waveguide QED with parametrically modulated coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically an array of two-level qubits moving relative to a one-dimensional waveguide. This motion can be implemented mechanically or simulated via the modulation of the couplings between the qubits and the waveguide. When the frequency of this motion approaches twice the qubit resonance frequency, it induces parametric generation of photons and excitation of the qubits. The proposed quantum optomechanical system offers a plethora of possibilities for exploring various quantum electrodynamics phenomena. However, their theoretical analysis is challenging due to the presence of quantum nonlinearity, a continuum of propagating photonic modes, and the excitation of strongly nonequilibrium qubit states, which make many conventional analytical tools inapplicable. To address these challenges, we develop a comprehensive general theoretical framework that incorporates both perturbative diagrammatic techniques and a rigorous master-equation approach. Our calculations reveal several intriguing effects, including the directional dynamical Casimir effect, where momenta of emitted photon pairs are correlated, and the waveguide-mediated collective Unruh effect, where motion drives the qubits to a nontrivial steady state that can be entangled and exhibit phase transitions. Additionally, we examine the radiation back-action on the qubit motion, which becomes particularly pronounced when subradiant modes in the qubit array are excited. The back-action can significantly alter the mechanical spectra, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid phonon-biphoton modes.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: How to build and control an all-fiber wavefront modulator using mechanical perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimode optical fibers support the dense, low-loss transmission of many spatial modes, making them attractive for technologies such as communications and imaging. However, information propagating through multimode fibers is scrambled, due to modal dispersion and mode mixing. This is usually rectified using wavefront shaping techniques with devices such as spatial light modulators. Recently, we demonstrated an all-fiber system for controlling light propagation inside multimode fibers using mechanical perturbations, called the fiber piano. In this tutorial we explain the design considerations and experimental methods needed to build a fiber piano, and review applications where fiber pianos have been used.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of ultrafast pulses via spectral inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resolution limits of classical spectroscopy can be surpassed by quantum-inspired methods leveraging the information contained in the phase of the complex electromagnetic field. Their counterpart in spatial imaging has been widely discussed and demonstrated; however, the spectral-domain implementations are few and scarce. We experimentally demonstrate a spectroscopic super-resolution method aimed at broadband light (10s to 100s of GHz), and based on the spectral-domain analog of image inversion interferometry. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we study the paradigmatic problem of estimating a small separation between two incoherent spectral features of equal brightness, with a small number of photons per coherence time. On the grounds of asymptotic estimation theory, more than a $2$-fold improvement over the spectral direct imaging is demonstrated in terms of required resources (photons) for a given estimator variance. The setup is based on an actively stabilized Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer with electro-optic time lenses and passive spectral dispersers implementing the inversion. As such, the method promises on-chip integration, good scalability, and further applications e.g. for mode sorting.</description>

      <title>Passive None-line-of-sight imaging with arbitrary scene condition and detection pattern in small amount of prior data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging requires to reconstruct objects which cannot be seen in line without using external controllable light sources. It can be widely applied in areas like counter-terrorism, urban-Warfare, autonomous-driving and robot-vision. Existing methods for passive NLOS typically required extensive prior information and significant computational resources to establish light transport matrices or train neural networks. These constraints pose significant challenges for transitioning models to different NLOS scenarios. Thus, the pressing issue in passive NLOS imaging currently lies in whether it is possible to estimate the light transport matrices which corresponding to relay surfaces and scenes, as well as the specific distribution of targets, with a small amount of prior knowledge. In this work, we hypothesized a high-dimensional manifold and mathematically proved its existence. Within this high-dimensional manifold, the structural information of obscured targets is minimally disrupted. Therefore, we proposed a universal framework named High-Dimensional Projection Selection (HDPS) which can establish this high-dimensional manifold and output its projection onto corresponding surfaces on low-dimensional. HDPS can be applied to most mature network architectures and estimate the distribution of target and light spot obtained by camera with only minimal prior data. Certainly, with the help of the estimated information, it can establish a high-dimensional manifold consisting of target and input. As demonstrated in experiment, our framework, even when applied to the most basic network structures, can achieve higher accuracy results with significantly smaller amounts of prior data. Thereby, our approach enables passive NLOS scenarios to reconstruct target by limited prior data and computational resources.</description>

      <title>Versatile Braiding of Non-Hermitian Topological Edge States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the most intriguing features of non-Hermitian (NH) systems is the ability of complex energies to form braids under parametric variation. Several braiding behaviors, including link and knot formation, have been observed in experiments on synthetic NH systems, such as looped optical fibers. The exact conditions for these phenomena remain unsettled, but existing demonstrations have involved long-range nonreciprocal hoppings, which are hard to implement on many experimental platforms. Here, we present a route to realizing complex energy braids using 1D NH Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper lattices. Under purely local gain and loss modulation, the eigenstates exhibit a variety of braiding behaviors, including unknots, Hopf links, trefoil knots, Solomon links and catenanes. We show how these are created by the interplay between non-Hermiticity and the lattice's bulk states and topological edge states. The transitions between different braids are marked by changes in the global Berry phase of the NH lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortices are topologically distinctive objects appearing as phase twists in coherent fields of optical beams and Bose-Einstein condensates. Structured networks and artificial lattices of coupled vortices could offer a powerful platform to study and simulate interaction mechanisms between constituents of condensed matter systems, such as antiferromagnetic interactions, by replacement of spin angular momentum with orbital angular momentum. Here, we realize such a platform using a macroscopic quantum fluid of light based on exciton-polariton condensates. We imprint all-optical hexagonal lattice that results into a triangular vortex lattice, with each cell having a vortex of charge l = +-1. We reveal that pairs of coupled condensates spontaneously arrange their orbital angular momentum antiparallel, implying a form of artificial orbital "antiferromagnetism". We discover that correlation exists between the emergent vortex patterns in triangular condensate lattices and the low-energy solutions of the corresponding antiferromagnetic Ising system. Our study offers a path toward spontaneously ordered vortex arrays with nearly arbitrary configurations and controlled couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional tomographic reconstruction, the pre-processing step includes flat-field correction, where each sample projection on the detector is divided by a reference image taken without the sample. When using coherent X-rays as probe, this approach overlooks the phase component of the illumination field (probe), leading to artifacts in phase-retrieved projection images, which are then propagated to the reconstructed 3D sample representation. The problem intensifies in nano-holotomography with focusing optics, that due to various imperfections create high-frequency components in the probe function. Here, we present a new iterative reconstruction scheme for holotomography, simultaneously retrieving the complex-valued probe function. Implemented on GPUs, this algorithm results in 3D reconstruction resolving twice thinner layers in a 3D ALD standard sample measured using nano-holotomography.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Edge-based OPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical proximity correction (OPC) is crucial for pushing the boundaries of semiconductor manufacturing and enabling the continued scaling of integrated circuits. While pixel-based OPC, termed as inverse lithography technology (ILT), has gained research interest due to its flexibility and precision. Its complexity and intricate features can lead to challenges in mask writing, increased defects, and higher costs, hence hindering widespread industrial adoption. In this paper, we propose DiffOPC, a differentiable OPC framework that enjoys the virtue of both edge-based OPC and ILT. By employing a mask rule-aware gradient-based optimization approach, DiffOPC efficiently guides mask edge segment movement during mask optimization, minimizing wafer error by propagating true gradients from the cost function back to the mask edges. Our approach achieves lower edge placement error while reducing manufacturing cost by half compared to state-of-the-art OPC techniques, bridging the gap between the high accuracy of pixel-based OPC and the practicality required for industrial adoption, thus offering a promising solution for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.</description>
