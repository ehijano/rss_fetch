      <title>Setting the stage: Building and maintaining a habitable world and the early conditions that could favor life's beginnings on Earth and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hadean, once thought to be uninhabitable and tumultuous, has more recently been recontextualized as a clement time in which oceans, land, and life likely appeared on Earth. This non-exhaustive chapter follows multiple threads from planet formation to the origin of life. We place significant emphasis on the solar system context for the Earth, the timing and nature of crustal formation and the evolution of the surface and atmosphere. Several scenarios for prebiotic chemistry are also discussed including atmospheric photochemistry, wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycles, and hydrothermal vent systems. We attempt to draw connections between the large-scale, planetary processes and various origin of life pathways to illustrate possible overlaps and correlations. In detail, we conclude with and discuss the "impact of impacts" to show how asteroid and comet impacts during the Hadean may have affected many of these processes and scenarios, from generating land to altering the chemical composition and oxidation state of the early Earth's atmosphere and surface.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reconstruction of Gappy Lagrangian Turbulent Signals by Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a stochastic method for reconstructing missing spatial and velocity data along the trajectories of small objects passively advected by turbulent flows with a wide range of temporal or spatial scales, such as small balloons in the atmosphere or drifters in the ocean. Our approach makes use of conditional generative diffusion models, a recently proposed data-driven machine learning technique. We solve the problem for two paradigmatic open problems, the case of 3D tracers in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, and 2D trajectories from the NOAA-funded Global Drifter Program. We show that for both cases, our method is able to reconstruct velocity signals retaining non-trivial scale-by-scale properties that are highly non-Gaussian and intermittent. A key feature of our method is its flexibility in dealing with the location and shape of data gaps, as well as its ability to naturally exploit correlations between different components, leading to superior accuracy, with respect to Gaussian process regressions, for both pointwise reconstruction and statistical expressivity. Our method shows promising applications also to a wide range of other Lagrangian problems, including multi-particle dispersion in turbulence, dynamics of charged particles in astrophysics and plasma physics, and pedestrian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Alternative climatic steady states near the Permian-Triassic Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to spatial scarcity and uncertainties in sediment data, initial and boundary conditions in deep-time climate simulations are not well constrained. On the other hand, the climate is a nonlinear system with a multitude of feedback mechanisms that compete and balance differently depending on the initial and boundary conditions. This opens up the possibility to obtain multiple steady states under the same forcing in numerical experiments. Here, we use the MIT general circulation model with a coupled atmosphere-ocean-thermodynamic sea ice-land configuration to explore the existence of such alternative steady states around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB). We construct the corresponding bifurcation diagram, taking into account processes on a timescale of thousands of years, in order to identify the stability range of the steady states and tipping points as the atmospheric CO$_2$ content is varied. We find three alternative steady states with a difference in global mean surface air temperature of about 10 $^\circ$C. We also examine how these climatic steady states are modified when feedbacks operating on comparable or longer time scales are included, in particular vegetation dynamics and air-sea carbon exchanges. Our findings on multistability provide a useful framework for explaining the climatic variations observed in the Early Triassic geological record, as well as some discrepancies between numerical simulations in the literature and geological data at PTB and its aftermath.</description>

      <title>Assessing the climate benefits of afforestation: processes, methods, and frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Afforestation greatly influences several earth system processes, making it essential to understand these effects to accurately assess its potential for climate change mitigation. Although our understanding of forest-climate system interactions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing definitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review, focusing on the Canadian northern boreal and southern arctic, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing knowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history, uncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes following afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies, emphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm conclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. Finally, we propose an assessment framework which considers multiple forcing components, temporal analysis, future climatic contexts, and implementation details. We hope that the research gaps and assessment framework discussed in this review inform afforestation policy in Canada and other circumpolar nations.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have shown immense potential as quick, inexpensive approximations to complex numerical and experimental modelling tasks. However, most surrogate models of physical systems do not quantify their uncertainty, rendering their predictions unreliable, requiring further validation. Though Bayesian approximations offer some solace in estimating the error associated with these models, they cannot provide guarantees, and the quality of their inferences depends on the availability of prior information and good approximations to posteriors for complex problems. This is particularly pertinent to multi-variable or spatio-temporal problems. Our work constructs and formalises a conformal prediction framework that satisfies marginal coverage for spatio-temporal predictions in a model-agnostic manner, requiring near-zero computational costs. We provide an extensive empirical study of the application of the framework to ascertain valid error bars that provide guaranteed coverage across the surrogate model's domain of operation. The application scope of our work extends across a large range of spatio-temporal models, from solving partial differential equations to weather forecasting. Through the applications, the paper looks at providing statistically valid error bars for deterministic models, as well as crafting guarantees to the error bars of probabilistic models. Our conformal prediction formalisation provides guaranteed coverage of the surrogate model, regardless of model architecture, and its training regime and is unbothered by the curse of dimensionality.</description>
