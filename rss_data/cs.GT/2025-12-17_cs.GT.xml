      <title>The Impact Market to Save Conference Peer Review: Decoupling Dissemination and Credentialing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-tier academic conferences are failing under the strain of two irreconcilable roles: (1) rapid dissemination of all sound research and (2) scarce credentialing for prestige and career advancement. This conflict has created a reviewer roulette and anonymous tribunal model - a zero-cost attack system - characterized by high-stakes subjectivity, turf wars, and the arbitrary rejection of sound research (the equivalence class problem). We propose the Impact Market (IM), a novel three-phase system that decouples publication from prestige. Phase 1 (Publication): All sound and rigorous papers are accepted via a PC review, solving the "equivalence class" problem. Phase 2 (Investment): An immediate, scarce prestige signal is created via a futures market. Senior community members invest tokens into published papers, creating a transparent, crowdsourced Net Invested Score (NIS). Phase 3 (Calibration): A 3-year lookback mechanism validates these investments against a manipulation-resistant Multi-Vector Impact Score (MVIS). This MVIS adjusts each investor's future influence (their Investor Rating), imposing a quantifiable cost on bad actors and rewarding accurate speculation. The IM model replaces a hidden, zero-cost attack system with a transparent, accountable, and data-driven market that aligns immediate credentialing with long-term, validated impact. Agent-based simulations demonstrate that while a passive market matches current protocols in low-skill environments, introducing investor agency and conviction betting increases the retrieval of high-impact papers from 28% to over 85% under identical conditions, confirming that incentivized self-selection is the mechanism required to scale peer review.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Strategic Evolution: Games with Endogenous Players and Strategic Replicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Von Neumann founded both game theory and the theory of self-reproducing automata, but the two programs never merged. This paper provides the synthesis. The Theory of Strategic Evolution analyzes strategic replicators: entities that optimize under resource constraints and spawn copies of themselves. We introduce Games with Endogenous Players (GEPs), where lineages (not instances) are the fundamental strategic units, and define Evolutionarily Stable Distributions of Intelligence (ESDIs) as the resulting equilibrium concept.
  The central mathematical object is a hierarchy of strategic layers linked by cross-level gain matrices. Under a small-gain condition (spectral radius less than one), the system admits a global Lyapunov function at every finite depth. We prove closure under meta-selection: adding governance levels, innovation, or constitutional evolution preserves the dynamical structure. The Alignment Impossibility Theorem shows that unrestricted self-modification destroys this structure; stable alignment requires bounded modification classes.
  Applications include AI deployment dynamics, market concentration, and institutional design. The framework shows why personality engineering fails under selection pressure and identifies constitutional constraints necessary for stable multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Semidefinite network games: multiplayer minimax and complementarity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network games provide a powerful framework for modeling agent interactions in networked systems, where players are represented by nodes in a graph and their payoffs depend on the actions taken by their neighbors. Extending the framework of network games, we introduce and study semidefinite network games. In this model, each player selects a positive semidefinite matrix with trace equal to one, known as a density matrix, to engage in a two-player game with every neighboring node. The player's payoff is the cumulative payoff acquired from these edge games. Initially, we focus on the zero-sum setting, where the sum of all players' payoffs is equal to zero. We establish that, in this class of games, Nash equilibria can be characterized as the projection of a spectrahedron. Furthermore, we show that determining whether a semidefinite network game is a zero-sum game is equivalent to deciding if the value of a semidefinite program is zero. Beyond the zero-sum case, we characterize Nash equilibria as the solutions of a semidefinite linear complementarity problem.</description>

      <title>Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself-a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following, mathematics, and coding benchmarks show that pretrained models can be effectively improved with self-play alone.</description>
