      <title>Measurement of cosmic muon-induced events in an HPGe detector using time-coincidence technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed understanding and suppression of backgrounds are among the key challenges faced by Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE\ensuremath{\nu}NS) experiments. The sensitivity of these experiments is largely determined by the background levels arising from various sources. Above-ground and shallow-overburden neutrino experiments typically employ passive shielding, primarily composed of lead (Pb), to suppress environmental $\gamma$ background. However, such shielding can introduce additional backgrounds that are particularly challenging for CE\ensuremath{\nu}NS experiments. These backgrounds arise mainly from $\gamma$ and neutrons produced by cosmic muon interactions in the shielding, and their contribution can become significant depending on the amount of Pb shielding used. In the current work, we measure the yield of secondary particles originating from Pb as a result of high-energy cosmic muon interaction, using a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector and plastic scintillators. A time-coincidence technique is used to identify and reject these secondary background events from the experimental data. The obtained mean characteristic time of these residual background events is 11 $\pm$ 4 $\mu$s, which is consistent with the Geant4-based MC simulation result of 11 $\pm$ 1 $\mu$s. The measured efficiency-corrected rate of muon-induced events in the HPGe detector is 34 $\pm$ 1 (stat.) $\pm$ 3 (sys.) day$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$ within the energy range of 30 keV to 2000 keV. The yield of muon-induced secondary backgrounds in 10 cm thick Pb shielding is evaluated to be $(11 \pm 1 (\text{stat.}) \pm 1 (\text{sys.}))$ secondary events$\thinspace\text{kg}^{-1}\thinspace\mathrm{m^{-2}}\thinspace\text{muon}^{-1}$ at sea level.</description>

      <title>Performance of the prototype Silicon Tracking System of the CBM experiment tested with heavy-ion beams at SIS18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is a heavy-ion experiment designed to study nuclear matter at the highest baryonic density. For high-statistics measurements of rare probes, event rates of up to 10 MHz are targeted. The experiment, therefore, requires fast and radiation-hard detectors, self-triggered detector front-ends, free-streaming readout architecture, and online event reconstruction. The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the main tracking detector of CBM, designed to reconstruct the trajectories of charged particles with efficiency larger than 95%, a momentum resolution better than 2% for particle momenta larger than 1 GeV/c inside a 1 Tm magnetic field, and to identify complex decay topologies. It comprises 876 double-sided silicon strip modules arranged in 8 tracking stations. A prototype of this detector, consisting of 12 modules arranged in three tracking stations, is installed in the mini-CBM demonstrator. This experimental setup is a small-scale precursor to the full CBM detector, composed of sub-units of all major CBM systems installed on the SIS18 beamline. In various beam campaigns taken between 2021 and 2024, heavy ion collisions at 1-2 AGeV with an average collision rate of 500 kHz have been measured. This allows for the evaluation of the operational performance of the STS detector, including time and position resolution, hit reconstruction efficiency, charge distribution, signal-to-noise ratio, and its potential for track and vertex reconstruction.</description>

      <title>The UV Laser Calibration System for measuring the Electric field in the SBND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Short Baseline Near Detector (SBND) is a LArTPC detector, located 110 meters from the Fermilab's Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB). It is designed to measure neutrino cross-section and aid in searches for excess electron like neutrino events. The electric field inside the SBND-TPC may have distortions due to a number of reasons, such as the space charge effect. The space charge effect comes from the abundance of cosmic rays that ionize the argon, producing copious positive argon ions. In this case, we need an alternative solution to determine the electric field distortion inside the TPC volume and compensate for the possible distortion in the spatial information. The UV Laser system is one such attempt to determine the electric field distortion. By utilising a high energy ultraviolet laser beam, the system can map the spatial distortions within the TPC volume and provide the necessary corrections to ensure accurate spatial and calorimetric measurements.</description>

      <title>Parametrizing the reconstruction performance of Super-Kamiokande in the Sub-GeV to TeV neutrino energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande is a paramount detector for studying atmospheric, astrophysical and accelerator neutrino physics. This work extracts and characterizes the neutrino reconstruction performance of Super-Kamiokande using the public data release from its latest atmospheric neutrino analysis. Energy and zenith angle reconstruction performances are derived and modeled for neutrinos spanning sub-GeV to TeV energies across different event samples and sample-specific and sample-aggregated performances are provided. These metrics enable realistic detector response modeling in phenomenological studies, establish benchmarks for evaluating alternative reconstruction algorithms, facilitate quantitative performance comparisons with other experiments, and provide a baseline performance model for the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector. This study represents the first publicly available comprehensive model to describe neutrino reconstruction in Super-Kamiokande in the Sub-GeV to TeV energies.</description>

      <title>Construction, Commissioning, and Installation of the Cylindrical GEM Inner Tracker of the BESIII Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BESIII (BEijing Spectrometer III) is a particle physics experiment with a vast physics program centered around the study of charmonium and the $\tau$ lepton. The performance of the spectrometer's inner tracker, the innermost part of a large drift chamber, has been degrading due to aging phenomena related to the large particle rate. Planned upgrades to the BEPCII (Beijing Electron Positron Collider II) collider, servicing the experiment, may further aggravate the problem, with the risk of disrupting the data taking. The Italian component of the BESIII collaboration proposed a detector based on cylindrical GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) technology to replace the aging inner tracker. The new detector aims to improve the current tracker's spatial resolution in the beam direction at least a factor 2 and to ensure the continuation of BESIII's data taking until its end in 2030. After more than 10 years of design, development, and construction the three layers of the CGEM-IT (Cylindrical GEM Inner Tracker) are finally being installed in the spectrometer. This thesis describes the three final years of the detector's development, which led from diagnosing and resolving mechanical issues preventing the largest layer from powering on to securing the approval of the experiment's internal review committee for installation. Particular focus is given to the technological solutions adopted to overcome the challenges encountered during the development process, which often required a complete rethinking of previous methods and procedures. The thesis concludes with a snapshot of the ongoing installation of the detector, commenting on the results of the preparatory work undertaken to ensure its success.</description>

      <title>High-precision laser spectrum analyzer via digital decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement of laser technology, accurately evaluating the noise spectrum of high-performance lasers has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a high-precision laser spectrum analyzer based on the proposed digital decoherence method, which can precisely measure the frequency noise spectrum of sub-Hz linewidth lasers. In addition, it has broad wavelength compatibility, which enables convenient switching between lasers with different center wavelengths. Its performance is validated through measurements of ultra-stable lasers. Based on the measured frequency noise power spectral density, a beta-line linewidth is determined to be 570 mHz at 10-second observation time, and the minimum observable linewidth is calculated to be 133 mHz. The system's noise floor is evaluated to be 210 mHz beta-line linewidth at 25-second observation time, and a minimum observable linewidth of 39 mHz.</description>

      <title>Efficient production of sodium Bose-Einstein condensates in a hybrid trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an apparatus that efficiently produces $^{23}$Na Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a hybrid trap that combines a quadrupole magnetic field with a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Using a Bayesian optimization framework, we systematically optimize all BEC production parameters in modest sized batches of highly correlated parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier-based technique to optimize the duration of different evaporation stages constrained to have a fixed total duration; this enables the progressive creation of increasingly rapid experimental sequences that still generate high quality BECs. Taken together, our techniques constitute a general approach for refining and accelerating sequence-based experimental protocols.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length. In our study, we measured the light yield, the energy resolution and the coincidence time resolution as a function of temperature for two pure CsI crystals read out by a pair of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An energy resolution of 6.3% FWHM and a coincidence time resolution of 1.84 ns at 511 keV were achieved at a temperature of 104 K. These results point towards the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TBPET scanners.</description>

      <title>Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Software-defined lock-in demodulator for low-frequency resistance noise measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resolution of low-frequency resistance noise measurements can be increased by amplitude modulation, shifting the spectrum of the resistance fluctuations away from the 1/f noise contributed by measurement instruments. However, commercial lock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit a problematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on the relative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-in amplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed using open-source software and off-the-shelf data acquisition systems. Compared to previous implementations of the lock-in principle, our solution offers real-time preview capabilities and is resource-efficient for long acquisition times at high sampling rates. Importantly, compared to high-end commercial lock-in instruments, our system offers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltage power spectral density by about two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Towards energy-insensitive and robust neutron/gamma classification: A learning-based frequency-domain parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron/gamma discrimination has been intensively researched in recent years, due to its unique scientific value and widespread applications. With the advancement of detection materials and algorithms, nowadays we can achieve fairly good discrimination. However, further improvements rely on better utilization of detector raw signals, especially energy-independent pulse characteristics. We begin by discussing why figure-of-merit (FoM) is not a comprehensive criterion for high-precision neutron/gamma discriminators, and proposing a new evaluation method based on adversarial sampling. Inspired by frequency-domain analysis in existing literature, parametric linear/nonlinear models with minimum complexity are created, upon the discrete spectrum, with tunable parameters just as neural networks. We train the models on an open-source neutron/gamma dataset (CLYC crystals with silicon photomultipliers) preprocessed by charge normalization to discover and exploit energy-independent features. The performance is evaluated on different sampling rates and noise levels, in comparison with the frequency classification index and conventional methods. The frequency-domain parametric models show higher accuracy and better adaptability to variations of data integrity than other discriminators. The proposed method is also promising for online inference on economical hardware and portable devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of narrow-band $\gamma$ radiation from a boron-doped diamond superlattice with an 855 MeV electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diamond superlattice with a period length of 3.54 $\mu$m was grown on a high quality straight (100) diamond plate with the method of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD). A sinusoidal varying boron doping profile resulted in a periodic variation of the lattice constant, and in turn four sinusoidally deformed (110) planes with a period length of 5.0 $\mu$m and an amplitude of 0.138 nm. A channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI accelerator facility. Part of the impinging electrons perform sinusoidal oscillations resulting in the emission of quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$ radiation. A clear peak was observed with a large sodium iodide scintillation detector close to the expected photon energy of 1.33 MeV. Gross properties like photon energy, width and intensity of the peak can be reproduced fairly well by idealized Monte-Carlo simulation calculations. Based on the latter, prospects of applying such $\gamma$ radiation sources are addressed with the example of the photonuclear reaction $^{100}$Mo($\gamma$,n)$^{99}$Mo at 14.3 MeV to produce the medical important $^{99m}$Tc isotope.</description>

      <title>A two-stage time-stretching TDC with discrete components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and testing of a time-stretching-based time-to-digital converter (TDC) implemented with discrete components. The TDC utilizes capacitor charging and discharging to achieve a time resolution of under 100 ps using a 100 MHz clock counter on a low-power, low-cost FPGA, achieving a time amplification factor of over 100. A two-stage time-stretching architecture is employed to reduce the conversion time to below 300 ns for a 10 ns input range. An onboard calibration system, including a pulse generation circuit, is implemented, and calibration results are presented. This system serves as a proof-of-concept platform for circuit optimization toward an ASIC implementation of a front-end TDC targeting future 4D pixel detectors at hadron colliders, with goals of sub-50 ps resolution and power consumption at the $\mu$W/channel level. Additionally, the design offers a modular, low-cost solution for extracting signal arrival times with 100 ps precision in particle physics experiments, such as photoelectron timing extraction for photodetector readout in neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Pixel column issue in the ATLAS Inner Tracker modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pixel modules are currently being built for the ATLAS ITk Pixel detector upgrade. During the preproduction phase, recurring chip malfunctioning was observed during electrical testing. It was possible to bypass this issue by disabling some pixel core columns in the ITkPix readout chip. Therefore the issue is called "core column issue" which is a direct disqualifier for a pixel module. A concerning number of cases has been observed in pixel modules with ITkPix v1.1 as well as v2 chips which significantly impacts the module yield. However, the behaviour is erratic and there is not any evidence hinting at the origin of this issue. These proceedings outline the investigations of the issue, highlighting the electrical behaviour during testing, present findings from the data collected via our production database and through visual inspection, and point towards possible causes of the issue.</description>

      <title>A miniaturized magnetic field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise limited magnetic field sensitivity of $5.9 \mathrm{nT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \mathrm{\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \mathrm{mW}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Relaxation Oscillations in Superconducting Nanobridge Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of $\sim19\text{MHz}$. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. We create a model that incorporates electrical feedback and excludes thermal effects to simulate and explain the origin of the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Qualitative agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.</description>

      <title>A Downstream and vertexing algorithm for Long Lived Particles (LLP) selection at the first High-level trigger (HLT1) of LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new algorithm has been developed at LHCb which is able to reconstruct and select very displaced vertices in real-time at the first level of the trigger (HLT1). It makes use of the Upstream Tracker (UT) and the Scintillator Fiber detector (SciFi) of LHCb and it is executed on GPUs inside the Allen framework. In addition to an optimized strategy, it utilizes a Neural Network (NN) implementation to increase the track efficiency and reduce the ghost rates, with very high throughput and limited time budget. Besides serving to reconstruct $K_{s}^{0}$ and $\Lambda$ particles from the Standard Model, the Downstream algorithm and the associated two-track vertexing could largely increase the LHCb physics potential for detecting long-lived particles during the Run 3.</description>
