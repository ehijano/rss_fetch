      <title>Asymptotic Betti bounds for hypersurfaces in a singular variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any degree $d$ hypersurface $Y \subset X$ in a possibly singular projective variety $X \subset \mathbf{P}^N$, the total Betti number of $Y$ is bounded by $3\text{deg}(X)\cdot d^n + C\cdot d^{n-1}$ for some explicit constant $C &gt; 0$ independent of $d$ and $Y$. When $X$ is a local complete intersection, the bound improves to $\text{deg}(X)\cdot d^n + C\cdot d^{n-1}$. In this case, the bound is asymptotically sharp. Similar bounds are also established for general constructible sheaves.</description>

      <title>Weil conjectures and affine hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give yet another proof of the Riemann hypothesis for smooth projective varieties over a finite field (Deligne's theorem), by reducing to the hypersurface case. The latter was established by N. Katz via an elementary argument. A reduction of this kind was previously carried out by A. J. Scholl. Our approach is slightly different, and relies on deformation to an affine hypersurface, together with Artin's vanishing theorem and basic properties of perverse sheaves.</description>

      <title>On the Orlov conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties via hyperholomorphic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Fourier transforms induced by Markman's projectively hyperholomorphic bundles on products of hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type. As applications, we prove the following. (a) Derived equivalent hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type have isomorphic homological motives preserving the cup-product. (b) All smooth projective moduli spaces of stable sheaves on a given $K3$ surface have isomorphic homological motives preserving the cup-product. (c) Assuming the Franchetta properties for the self-products of polarized $K3$ surfaces, the isomorphisms in (b) can be lifted to Chow motives for $K3$ surfaces of Picard rank 1. These results provide evidence for the Orlov conjecture and a conjecture of Fu-Vial.</description>

      <title>On the triviality of direct image of vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi\,:\, X \,\longrightarrow\, Y$ be a finite morphism of smooth projective varieties defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We study the necessary and sufficient criteria for $\pi$ such that there exists a vector bundle $E$ on $X$ whose direct image $\pi_*E$ is trivial. We show that the existence of $E$ is guided by the properties of the branching divisor of $\pi$. When the covering $\pi\,:\, X \,\longrightarrow\, Y$ is ramified abelian Galois, we give a complete answer. As an application, we prove every smooth ramified abelian Galois covering of $\mathbb{P}^n$ supports an Ulrich bundle.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb A^1$-connected components of affine quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any smooth quadratic hypersurface $X$ in $\mathbb A^n_k$, we use the iterations of the functor of naive $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected components $\mathcal{S}$ to study the field-valued sections of the sheaf of $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected components $\pi_0^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X)$ of $X$. We prove that for any field $F/k$, the canonical isomorphism $\pi_0^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X)(F) \xrightarrow{\sim} \lim_{n} \mathcal{S}^n(X)(F)$ stabilizes at $n=2$, meaning that $\pi_0^{\mathbb{A}^1}(X)(F)=\mathcal{S}^2(X)(F)$. Furthermore, by combining this result with Morel's characterization of $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected spaces in terms of the triviality of field-valued sections of $\pi_0^{\mathbb{A}^1}$, we provide a complete characterization of $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected smooth quadratic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{A}^n_k$.</description>

      <title>Saturation of algebraic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturation of an algebraic surface is the maximal open embedding with complement of dimension zero. For schemes, it was introduced by the first named author and A. Bondal, who proved that the saturation of a surface X can be recovered from the category of reflexive sheaves on X. In this article, we extend these results to algebraic spaces. Furthermore, we address the question of A. Bondal whether every saturated surface X is proper over its affinisation. We prove that passing from schemes to algebraic spaces guarantees that this property holds whenever the affinisation is non-trivial. Finally, we give some characterisation of saturated surfaces depending on the dimension of their affinisation.</description>

      <title>Structures in topological recursion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the basic structures of degree-$g$ topological recursion relations on the moduli space of curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$: (i) The coefficient of the bouquet class on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$, which gives the answer to a conjecture of T. Kimura and X. Liu; (ii) Linear relations among the coefficients of certain rational tails locus of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$.
  Three applications of topological recursion relations will be discussed: (i) Coefficients of universal equations for Gromov-Witten invariants for any smooth projective variety; (ii) The coefficient of the bouquet class in the double ramification formula of the top Hodge class $\lambda_g$; (iii) A new recursive formula for computing the intersection numbers on the moduli space of stable curves.</description>

      <title>Toward the noncommutative minimal model program for Fano varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative minimal model program, as proposed by Halpern-Leistner, for Fano varieties. We construct lifts of Iritani's quantum cohomology central charge in the following examples: Grassmannians, smooth quadrics, and smooth cubic threefolds and fourfolds. Moreover, we verify that these lifted paths are quasi-convergent and give rise to the expected semiorthogonal decompositions of the bounded derived category. We also construct geometric stability conditions in the examples above and observe that, after suitable isomonodromic deformation of the quantum cohomology central charge, the quasi-convergent paths for Grassmannians and quadrics can be chosen to start in the geometric region.</description>

      <title>Motivic and cohomological stabilisation of the Quot scheme of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the motive of the punctual Quot scheme $\mathrm{Quot}^d(\mathscr O^{\oplus r}_{\mathbb A^n})_0$ stabilises, when $n \to \infty$, to $[\mathrm{Gr}(d-1,\infty)]\cdot \sum_{i=0}^{r-1}\mathbb L^{di}$. We similarly show that the Poincar\'e polynomial of the Quot scheme $ \mathrm{Quot}^d(\mathscr O^{\oplus r}_{\mathbb A^n})$ stabilises and we compute the limit in terms of the infinite Grassmannian. Finally, we prove that the motive of the nested Hilbert scheme stabilises to the motive of the infinite flag variety and we compute the cohomology ring in the limit. These results provide affirmative evidence to a question of Pandharipande concerning the cohomology of Quot schemes on $\mathbb A^\infty$.</description>

      <title>Sufficiently Regularized Nonnegative Quartic Polynomials are Sum-of-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hilbert's 17th problem famously established that not all nonnegative polynomials admit a sum-of-squares (SoS) representation. Hilbert also identified a few special classes in which nonnegativity and SoS are equivalent, such as univariate polynomials, quadratic polynomials, and bivariate quartic polynomials. In this paper, we extend this equivalence to several new subclasses of multivariate quartically regularized polynomials and characterize the NP-hardness boundary of these special-structure polynomials. Specifically, we consider the global optimization of multivariate symmetric cubic polynomials regularized by weighted quartic powers of the Euclidean norm. These special-structure polynomials arise as iterative subproblems in high-order tensor methods for nonconvex optimization problems. We consider shifting these polynomials by their global optimum so as to make them nonnegative, and show that for sufficiently large regularization parameters and under mild assumptions, these polynomials admit a sum-of-squares representation. We also identify several structured subclasses of quartically regularized cubic polynomials for which global optimality of the model implies that nonnegativity is certified by a sum-of-squares decomposition for all values of the regularization parameter, including quadratic-quartic polynomials and quartic polynomials containing a special cubic term that can be decomposed as the product of a quadratic norm and a linear form. We provide counterexamples based on quartic separable norms that demonstrate the crucial role of the Euclidean norm in these representations. Finally, we illustrate how these SoS-based certificates can be used for Taylor subproblems arising in high-order tensor methods for nonconvex optimization, with encouraging numerical results.</description>

      <title>Geometric purity and the frame of smashing ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of geometric purity in rigidly-compactly generated tt-categories by considering exact triangles that are pure at each tt-stalk. We develop a systematic study of this concept, including examples and applications. In particular, we show that geometric purity is, in general, strictly stronger than ordinary purity, and that it naturally leads to the notion of geometrically pure-injective objects. We prove that such objects arise as pushforwards of pure-injective objects from suitable tt-stalks. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of indecomposable geometrically pure-injective objects in the derived category of the projective line. Under mild additional assumptions, we identify the geometric part of the Ziegler spectrum as a closed subset.
  As an application, we demonstrate that this new notion of purity can be used to tackle the problem of spatiality of the frame of smashing ideals via the geometric Ziegler spectrum. In particular, we show that our approach rules out the counterexamples of Balchin and Stevenson to existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending Katz-Sarnak heuristics, Ballini-Lombardo-Verzobio [BLV25] conjectures a limiting distribution as $p \to \infty$ for $\# A_g(\mathbb F_p,t)$, the number of $g$-dimensional PPAVs over $\mathbb F_p$ with trace $t$, as a product of natural local factors $v_\ell(t)$ for non-archimedean places $\ell$ and the Sato-Tate measure $\text{ST}_g$ corresponding to $\infty$. We prove that their conjecture is true for all $g$. As a consequence, we obtain analogous results on the distribution of curves of genus $2$ and $3$, answering questions of Bergstr\"om-Howe-Garc\'ia-Ritzenthaler [BHLR24] and [BLV25].</description>

Abstract: We establish a relative Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for Alexander complexes (also known as Sabbah specialization complexes) by using relative regular holonomic $\mathscr D$-modules in an equivariant way, which particularly gives a "global" approach to the correspondence for Deligne's nearby cycles. Using the correspondence and zero loci of Bernstein-Sato ideals, we obtain a formula for the relative support of the Alexander complexes.</description>

Abstract: The moduli space of bundle stable pairs $\overline{M}_C(2,\Lambda)$ on a smooth projective curve $C$, introduced by Thaddeus, is a smooth Fano variety of Picard rank two. Focusing on the genus two case, we show that its K-moduli space is isomorphic to a GIT moduli of lines in quartic del Pezzo threefolds. Additionally, we construct a natural forgetful morphism from the K-moduli of $\overline{M}_C(2,\Lambda)$ to that of the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles $\overline{N}_C(2,\Lambda)$. In particular, Thaddeus' moduli spaces for genus two curves are all K-stable.</description>

Abstract: We study the behavior of integral transforms under various forms of base change. In particular, we establish a yoga of local algebra and fibers to test for derived equivalences via integral transforms. This partially generalizes a result of Orlov to singular varieties and strengthens many results in the literature to arbitrary fields. Additionally, it provides new insight into fibrations and their singularities arising in more arithmetically flavored contexts (e.g. projective and flat schemes over a DVR).</description>

Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, of Darboux from 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with the finite group of random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$, obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. Explicit examples of random walks with the groups of orders higher than 10 are presented here for the first time, including orders 12, 14, 16. The same method applies to any higher order. We consider cases with singular biquadratics in a systematic manner. We establish a new two-way relationship between diagonal random walks and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar links for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem: after $n$ iterations, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one of the same orientation, that he solved for $n=2$, which was recently extended to $n=3$. We also study $k$-semi-periodicity as a natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing a new object, the secondary $(2,2)$ correspondence, and the related secondary cubic of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form, while the case $k=2$ was solved recently.</description>

      <title>Thomason condition for regular algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Thomason condition holds for any concentrated regular Noetherian algebraic stack with quasi-finite and locally separated diagonal. As a consequence, the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on such an algebraic stack is singly compactly generated. This extends results of Hall--Rydh from separated to locally separated diagonal, under additional regularity hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Topologically integrable derivations and additive group actions on affine ind-schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of additive group actions on affine ind-schemes through a purely algebraic and topological framework. Affine ind-schemes are described via complete, second-countable, linearly topologized rings, and actions of the additive group are encoded by restricted exponential homomorphisms. We introduce the notion of a topologically integrable derivation, a continuous derivation whose formal exponential converges in the sense of restricted power series, and show that this notion provides the correct extension of locally nilpotent derivations to the infinite-dimensional setting. Our first main result establishes a one-to-one correspondence between topologically integrable derivations and additive group actions on affine ind-schemes, extending the classical correspondence for affine varieties. We then investigate the structure of such actions admitting a slice. In this context, we prove an ind-scheme analog of the classical slice theorem: if an additive group action admits a slice, then the underlying affine ind-scheme is equivariantly isomorphic to a product with the affine line, and the action is given by translation on the second factor. Several examples illustrate the necessity of the topological hypotheses and highlight phenomena absent in the finite-type case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the Hitchin metric on the moduli space of Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of stable Higgs bundles of degree $0$ is equipped with the hyperk\"ahler metric, called the Hitchin metric. On the locus where the spectral curves are smooth, there is the hyperk\"ahler metric called the semi-flat metric, associated with the algebraic integrable systems with the Hitchin section. We prove the exponentially rapid decay of the difference between the Hitchin metric and the semi-flat metric along the ray $(E,t\theta)$ as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic mapping class relations from pencil pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe symplectic mapping class relations between products of positive Dehn twists along Lagrangian spheres in Weinstein $4$-manifolds, all of which are affine $\mathbb{C}$ varieties. The relations are obtained by applying classification results for Fano $3$-folds and polarized $K3$ surfaces of small genus to a general methodology -- finding pencil pairs.</description>

      <title>Toric varieties modulo reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a finite group generated by reflections of a lattice $M$. If a lattice polytope $P \subset M \otimes_{\mathbb Z}\mathbb R$ is preserved by $W$, then we show that the quotient of the projective toric variety $X_P$ by $W$ is isomorphic to the toric variety $X_{P \cap D}$, where $D$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $W$. This answers a question of Horiguchi-Masuda-Shareshian-Song, and recovers results of Blume, of Song, of the second author, and of Gui-Hu-Liu. We also study quotients of real toric varieties, proving that $X_P^{\mathbb R} / W$ is contractible when $P$ is a permutohedron.</description>

      <title>Conformal bootstrap in Mellin space from GG systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple scheme to express the Mellin transform of $D$-dimensional Euclidean conformal bootstrap equation is presented by relating conformal blocks to a Gauss-Grassmann (GG) system due to Gelfand-Graev, associated to conformal integrals, which, in turn, are generalised hypergeometric functions. Usefulness of the expression for obtaining bounds on the spectrum of fields is demonstrated.</description>
