      <title>What Teaches Robots to Walk, Teaches Them to Trade too -- Regime Adaptive Execution using Informed Data and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques applied to the problem of financial market forecasting struggle with dynamic regime switching, or underlying correlation and covariance shifts in true (hidden) market variables. Drawing inspiration from the success of reinforcement learning in robotics, particularly in agile locomotion adaptation of quadruped robots to unseen terrains, we introduce an innovative approach that leverages world knowledge of pretrained LLMs (aka. 'privileged information' in robotics) and dynamically adapts them using intrinsic, natural market rewards using LLM alignment technique we dub as "Reinforcement Learning from Market Feedback" (**RLMF**). Strong empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in adapting to regime shifts in financial markets, a challenge that has long plagued predictive models in this domain. The proposed algorithmic framework outperforms best-performing SOTA LLM models on the existing (FLARE) benchmark stock-movement (SM) tasks by more than 15\% improved accuracy. On the recently proposed NIFTY SM task, our adaptive policy outperforms the SOTA best performing trillion parameter models like GPT-4. The paper details the dual-phase, teacher-student architecture and implementation of our model, the empirical results obtained, and an analysis of the role of language embeddings in terms of Information Gain.</description>

      <title>$\text{Alpha}^2$: Discovering Logical Formulaic Alphas using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alphas are pivotal in providing signals for quantitative trading. The industry highly values the discovery of formulaic alphas for their interpretability and ease of analysis, compared with the expressive yet overfitting-prone black-box alphas. In this work, we focus on discovering formulaic alphas. Prior studies on automatically generating a collection of formulaic alphas were mostly based on genetic programming (GP), which is known to suffer from the problems of being sensitive to the initial population, converting to local optima, and slow computation speed. Recent efforts employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for alpha discovery have not fully addressed key practical considerations such as alpha correlations and validity, which are crucial for their effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel framework for alpha discovery using DRL by formulating the alpha discovery process as program construction. Our agent, $\text{Alpha}^2$, assembles an alpha program optimized for an evaluation metric. A search algorithm guided by DRL navigates through the search space based on value estimates for potential alpha outcomes. The evaluation metric encourages both the performance and the diversity of alphas for a better final trading strategy. Our formulation of searching alphas also brings the advantage of pre-calculation dimensional analysis, ensuring the logical soundness of alphas, and pruning the vast search space to a large extent. Empirical experiments on real-world stock markets demonstrates $\text{Alpha}^2$'s capability to identify a diverse set of logical and effective alphas, which significantly improves the performance of the final trading strategy. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/x35f/alpha2.</description>

      <title>An Improved Algorithm to Identify More Arbitrage Opportunities on Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the arbitrage paths exist abundantly in the form of both arbitrage loops (e.g. the arbitrage path starts from token A and back to token A again in the end, A, B,..., A) and non-loops (e.g. the arbitrage path starts from token A and stops at a different token N, A, B,..., N). The Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm, often coupled with the ``walk to the root" technique, is commonly employed for detecting arbitrage loops in the token graph of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap. However, a limitation of this algorithm is its ability to recognize only a limited number of arbitrage loops in each run. Additionally, it cannot specify the starting token of the detected arbitrage loops, further constraining its effectiveness in certain scenarios. Another limitation of this algorithm is its incapacity to detect non-loop arbitrage paths between any specified pairs of tokens. In this paper, we develop a new method to solve these problems by combining the line graph and a modified Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm (MMBF). This method can help to find more arbitrage loops by detecting at least one arbitrage loop starting from any specified tokens in the DEXs and can detect the non-loop arbitrage paths between any pair of tokens. Then, we applied our algorithm to Uniswap V2 and found more arbitrage loops and non-loops indeed compared with applying the Moore-Bellman-Ford (MBF) combined algorithm. The found arbitrage profit by our method in some arbitrage paths can be even as high as one million dollars, far larger than that found by the MBF combined algorithm. Finally, we statistically compare the distribution of arbitrage path lengths and the arbitrage profit detected by both our method and the MBF combined algorithm, and depict how potential arbitrage opportunities change with time by our method.</description>

      <title>Profit Maximization In Arbitrage Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic arbitrage chances exist abundantly among decentralized exchanges (DEXs), like Uniswap V2. For an arbitrage cycle (loop), researchers or practitioners usually choose a specific token, such as Ether as input, and optimize their input amount to get the net maximal amount of the specific token as arbitrage profit. By considering the tokens' prices from CEXs in this paper, the new arbitrage profit, called monetized arbitrage profit, will be quantified as the product of the net number of a specific token we got from the arbitrage loop and its corresponding price in CEXs. Based on this concept, we put forward three different strategies to maximize the monetized arbitrage profit for each arbitrage loop. The first strategy is called the MaxPrice strategy. Under this strategy, arbitrageurs start arbitrage only from the token with the highest CEX price. The second strategy is called the MaxMax strategy. Under this strategy, we calculate the monetized arbitrage profit for each token as input in turn in the arbitrage loop. Then, we pick up the most maximal monetized arbitrage profit among them as the monetized arbitrage profit of the MaxMax strategy. The third one is called the Convex Optimization strategy. By mapping the MaxMax strategy to a convex optimization problem, we proved that the Convex Optimization strategy could get more profit in theory than the MaxMax strategy, which is proved again in a given example. We also proved that if no arbitrage profit exists according to the MaxMax strategy, then the Convex Optimization strategy can not detect any arbitrage profit, either. However, the empirical data analysis denotes that the profitability of the Convex Optimization strategy is almost equal to that of the MaxMax strategy, and the MaxPrice strategy is not reliable in getting the maximal monetized arbitrage profit compared to the MaxMax strategy.</description>

      <title>Integral Betti signature confirms the hyperbolic geometry of brain, climate, and financial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the possibility to examine the underlying curvature of data through the lens of topology by using the Betti curves, tools of Persistent Homology, as key topological descriptors, building on the clique topology approach. It was previously shown that Betti curves distinguish random from Euclidean geometric matrices - i.e. distance matrices of points randomly distributed in a cube with Euclidean distance. In line with previous experiments, we consider their low-dimensional approximations named integral Betti values, or signatures that effectively distinguish not only Euclidean, but also spherical and hyperbolic geometric matrices, both from purely random matrices as well as among themselves. To prove this, we analyse the behaviour of Betti curves for various geometric matrices -- i.e. distance matrices of points randomly distributed on manifolds of constant sectional curvature, considering the classical models of curvature 0, 1, -1, given by the Euclidean space, the sphere, and the hyperbolic space. We further investigate the dependence of integral Betti signatures on factors including the sample size and dimension. This is important for assessment of real-world connectivity matrices, as we show that the standard approach to network construction gives rise to (spurious) spherical geometry, with topology dependent on sample dimensions. Finally, we use the manifolds of constant curvature as comparison models to infer curvature underlying real-world datasets coming from neuroscience, finance and climate. Their associated topological features exhibit a hyperbolic character: the integral Betti signatures associated to these datasets sit in between Euclidean and hyperbolic (of small curvature). The potential confounding ``hyperbologenic effect'' of intrinsic low-rank modular structures is also evaluated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Computing the SSR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The skew-stickiness-ratio (SSR), examined in detail by Bergomi in his book, is critically important to options traders, especially market makers. We present a model-free expression for the SSR in terms of the characteristic function. In the diffusion setting, it is well-known that the short-term limit of the SSR is 2; a corollary of our results is that this limit is $H+3/2$ where $H$ is the Hurst exponent of the volatility process. The general formula for the SSR simplifies and becomes particularly tractable in the affine forward variance case. We explain the qualitative behavior of the SSR with respect to the shape of the forward variance curve, and thus also path-dependence of the SSR.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil: Robust backdoor attack via Stochastic investment models and Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</description>
