      <title>RiboGen: RNA Sequence and Structure Co-Generation with Equivariant MultiFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays fundamental roles in biological systems, from carrying genetic information to performing enzymatic function. Understanding and designing RNA can enable novel therapeutic application and biotechnological innovation. To enhance RNA design, in this paper we introduce RiboGen, the first deep learning model to simultaneously generate RNA sequence and all-atom 3D structure. RiboGen leverages the standard Flow Matching with Discrete Flow Matching in a multimodal data representation. RiboGen is based on Euclidean Equivariant neural networks for efficiently processing and learning three-dimensional geometry. Our experiments show that RiboGen can efficiently generate chemically plausible and self-consistent RNA samples. Our results suggest that co-generation of sequence and structure is a competitive approach for modeling RNA.</description>

      <title>Multimodal AI predicts clinical outcomes of drug combinations from preclinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations. Current models rely on structural or target-based features to identify high-efficacy, low-toxicity drug combinations. However, these approaches fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically-relevant predictions. Here, we introduce MADRIGAL, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. MADRIGAL uses a transformer bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference--a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions. MADRIGAL performs virtual screening of anticancer drug combinations and supports polypharmacy management for type II diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). It identifies transporter-mediated drug interactions. MADRIGAL predicts resmetirom, the first and only FDA-approved drug for MASH, among therapies with the most favorable safety profile. It supports personalized cancer therapy by integrating genomic profiles from cancer patients. Using primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models, it predicts the efficacy of personalized drug combinations. Integrating MADRIGAL with a large language model allows users to describe clinical outcomes in natural language, improving safety assessment by identifying potential adverse interactions and toxicity risks. MADRIGAL provides a multimodal approach for designing combination therapies with improved predictive accuracy and clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>cryoSPHERE: Single-particle heterogeneous reconstruction from cryo EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-dimensional structure of proteins plays a crucial role in determining their function. Protein structure prediction methods, like AlphaFold, offer rapid access to a protein structure. However, large protein complexes cannot be reliably predicted, and proteins are dynamic, making it important to resolve their full conformational distribution. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful tool for determining the structures of large protein complexes. Importantly, the numerous images of a given protein contain underutilized information about conformational heterogeneity. These images are very noisy projections of the protein, and traditional methods for cryo-EM reconstruction are limited to recovering only one or a few consensus conformations. In this paper, we introduce cryoSPHERE, which is a deep learning method that uses a nominal protein structure (e.g., from AlphaFold) as input, learns how to divide it into segments, and moves these segments as approximately rigid bodies to fit the different conformations present in the cryo-EM dataset. This approach provides enough constraints to enable meaningful reconstructions of single protein structural ensembles. We demonstrate this with two synthetic datasets featuring varying levels of noise, as well as two real dataset. We show that cryoSPHERE is very resilient to the high levels of noise typically encountered in experiments, where we see consistent improvements over the current state-of-the-art for heterogeneous reconstruction.</description>
