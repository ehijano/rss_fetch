      <title>Generating configurations of increasing lattice size with machine learning and the inverse renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent developments of machine learning algorithms pertinent to the inverse renormalization group, which was originally established as a generative numerical method by Ron-Swendsen-Brandt via the implementation of compatible Monte Carlo simulations. Inverse renormalization group methods enable the iterative generation of configurations for increasing lattice size without the critical slowing down effect. We discuss the construction of inverse renormalization group transformations with the use of convolutional neural networks and present applications in models of statistical mechanics, lattice field theory, and disordered systems. We highlight the case of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson spin glass, where the inverse renormalization group can be employed to construct configurations for lattice volumes that have not yet been accessed by dedicated supercomputers.</description>

      <title>Gribov copies in the quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of Gribov copies on the quark propagator in lattice 2-colour QCD. We find that the Gribov noise is comparable to the gauge noise for smaller volumes but becomes less significant for larger spatial volumes. The Gribov noise in the quark propagator is found to be comparable to, but smaller than in the gluon propagator on the same ensembles. No correlation is found between the values of either of the quark propagator form factors and the value of the gauge fixing functional, nor between the two form factors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Potential of the Polyakov Loop in SU(3) Quenched Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical manner for the first time. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value with no source term. In particular, we deal with the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, just corresponding to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into each of $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method where gauge configurations around each vacuum are separately used. We eventually obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

      <title>Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD result for the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton and neutron. Our calculation includes both quark-connected and -disconnected diagrams and assesses all sources of systematic uncertainties arising from excited-state contributions, finite-volume effects and the continuum extrapolation. At the physical point, we obtain for the proton $r_Z^p = ( 1.013 \pm 0.010\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$ and $r_F^p = ( 1.301 \pm 0.012\ (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.014\ (\mathrm{syst}) )~\mathrm{fm}$. These numbers suggest small values of the Zemach and Friar radii of the proton, but are compatible with most of the experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Yet another lattice formulation of 2D $U(1)$ chiral gauge theory via bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, lattice formulations of Abelian chiral gauge theory in two dimensions have been devised on the basis of the Abelian bosonization. A salient feature of these 2D lattice formulations is that the gauge invariance is \emph{exactly\/} preserved for anomaly-free theories and thus is completely free from the question of the gauge mode decoupling. In the present paper, we propose a yet another lattice formulation sharing this desired property. A particularly unique point in our formulation is that the vertex operator of the dual scalar field, which carries the vector charge of the fermion and the ``magnetic charge'' in the bosonization, is represented by a ``hole'' excised from the lattice; this is the excision method formulated recently by Abe et al. in a somewhat different context.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Toward QCD on Quantum Computer: Orbifold Lattice Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an orbifold lattice formulation of QCD suitable for quantum simulations. We show explicitly how to encode gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using noncompact variables, and how to write down a simple truncated Hamiltonian in the coordinate basis. We show that SU(3) gauge group variables and quarks in the fundamental representation can be implemented straightforwardly on qubits, for arbitrary truncation of the gauge manifold.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of SU(3) Lattice Yang Mills Theory at Leading Order in Large N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of the dynamics of QCD have been limited by the complexities of mapping the continuous gauge fields onto quantum computers. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of N_c. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits. This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a 5x5 and 8x8 lattice on ibm_torino with a CNOT depth of 113.</description>

      <title>Properties of the ground and excited states of triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons with quark contents $ ccb $ and $ bbc $, and calculate their mass and residue using QCD sum rules. In the calculations, we consider the ground (1S), first orbitally excited (1P) and first radially excited (2S) states. Aiming to achieve higher accuracies in the results, we perform the computations by taking into account the non-perturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We compare our results with the predictions of other theoretical studies existing in the literature. The obtained results may help experimental groups in their search for these yet unseen, but previously predicted by the quark model, interesting particles.</description>

      <title>Ghost-gluon vertex in the presence of the Gribov horizon: General kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions are important probes for the behavior of quantum field theories. Already at tree-level, the Refined Gribov Zwanziger (RGZ) effective action for Yang-Mills theories provides a good approximation for the gluon propagator, as compared to that calculated by nonperturbative methods such as Lattice Field Theory and Dyson-Schwinger Equations. However, the study of higher correlation functions of the RGZ theory is still at its beginning. In this work we evaluate the ghost-antighost-gluon vertex function in Landau gauge at one-loop level, in $d=4$ space-time dimensions for the gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3). More precisely, we extend the analysis conducted in [1] for the soft-gluon limit to an arbitrary kinematic configuration. We introduce renormalization group effects by means of a toy model for the running coupling and investigate the impact of such a model in the ultraviolet tails of our results. We find that RGZ results match fairly closely those from lattice simulations, Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Curci-Ferrari model for three different kinematic configurations. This is compatible with RGZ being a feasible theory for the strong interaction in the infrared regime.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>
