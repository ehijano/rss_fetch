      <title>How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13920v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating pric to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability of Stochastic Hemivariational Control problem in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the approximate controllability for control systems governed by stochastic evolution hemivariational inequalities in Hilbert spaces. The interest in studying this type of equation comes from its application in some physical models like the thermostat temperature control or the diffusion through semi-permeable walls. Firstly, we introduce the concept of weak solutions for hemivariational inequalities. Then, the controllability is formulated by utilizing stochastic analysis techniques and properties of Clarke subdifferential operators, as well as applying multivalued fixed point theorem. Finally, we conclude this article by an application in stochastic heat propagation problem.</description>

      <title>Computing Equilibria in Stochastic Nonconvex and Non-monotone Games via Gradient-Response Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of smooth $N$-player noncooperative games, where player objectives are expectation-valued and potentially nonconvex. In such a setting, we consider the largely open question of efficiently computing a suitably defined {\em quasi}-Nash equilibrium (QNE) via a single-step gradient-response framework. First, under a suitably defined quadratic growth property, we prove that the stochastic synchronous gradient-response ({\bf SSGR}) scheme and its asynchronous counterpart ({\bf SAGR}) are characterized by almost sure convergence to a QNE and a sublinear rate guarantee. Notably, when a potentiality requirement is overlaid under a somewhat stronger pseudomonotonicity condition, this claim can be made for NE, rather than QNE. Second, under a weak sharpness property, we show that the deterministic synchronous variant displays a {\em linear} rate of convergence sufficiently close to a QNE by leveraging a geometric decay in steplengths. This suggests the development of a two-stage scheme with global non-asymptotic sublinear rates and a local linear rate. Third, when player problems are convex but the associated concatenated gradient map is potentially non-monotone, we prove that a zeroth-order asynchronous modified gradient-response ({\bf ZAMGR}) scheme can efficiently compute NE under a suitable copositivity requirement. Collectively, our findings represent amongst the first inroads into efficient computation of QNE/NE in nonconvex settings, leading to a set of single-step schemes that with broader reach while often providing last-iterate rate guarantees. We present applications satisfying the prescribed requirements where preliminary numerics appear promising.</description>

      <title>Inferring Structure via Duality for Photonic Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Led by a result derived from Sion's minimax theorem concerning constraint violation in quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) with at least one constraint bounding the possible solution magnitude, we propose a heuristic scheme for photonic inverse design unifying core ideas from adjoint optimization and convex relaxation bounds. Specifically, through a series of alterations to the underlying constraints and objective, the QCQP associated with a given design problem is gradually transformed so that it becomes strongly dual. Once equivalence between primal and dual programs is achieved, a material geometry is inferred from the solution of the modified QCQP. This inferred structure, due to the complementary relationship between the dual and primal programs, encodes overarching features of the optimization landscape that are otherwise difficult to synthesize, and provides a means of initializing secondary optimization methods informed by the global problem context. An exploratory implementation of the framework, presented in a partner manuscript, is found to achieve dramatic improvements for the exemplary photonic design task of enhancing the amount of power extracted from a dipole source near the boundary of a structured material region -- roughly an order of magnitude compared to randomly initialized adjoint-based topology optimization for areas surpassing $10~\lambda^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Code generation for solving and differentiating through convex optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce custom code generation for parametrized convex optimization problems that supports evaluating the derivative of the solution with respect to the parameters, i.e., differentiating through the optimization problem. We extend the open source code generator CVXPYgen, which itself extends CVXPY, a Python-embedded domain-specific language with a natural syntax for specifying convex optimization problems, following their mathematical description. Our extension of CVXPYgen adds a custom C implementation to differentiate the solution of a convex optimization problem with respect to its parameters, together with a Python wrapper for prototyping and desktop (non-embedded) applications. We give three representative application examples: Tuning hyper-parameters in machine learning; choosing the parameters in an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) controller; and adjusting the parameters in an optimization based financial trading engine via back-testing, i.e., simulation on historical data. While differentiating through convex optimization problems is not new, CVXPYgen is the first tool that generates custom C code for the task, and increases the computation speed by about an order of magnitude in most applications, compared to CVXPYlayers, a general-purpose tool for differentiating through convex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient state transition algorithm with guaranteed optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a constructivism-based intelligent optimization method, state transition algorithm (STA) has exhibited powerful search ability in optimization. However, the standard STA still shows slow convergence at a later stage for flat landscape and a user has to preset its maximum number of iterations (or function evaluations) by experience. To resolve these two issues, efficient state transition algorithm is proposed with guaranteed optimality. Firstly, novel translation transformations based on predictive modeling are proposed to generate more potential candidates by utilizing historical information. Secondly, parameter control strategies are proposed to accelerate the convergence. Thirdly, a specific termination condition is designed to guarantee that the STA can stop automatically at an optimal point, which is equivalent to the zero gradient in mathematical programming. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Forward-Backward Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Optimal Controls: Equilibrium Strategies and Non-Symmetric Riccati Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear-quadratic optimal control problem for systems governed by forward-backward stochastic differential equations has been extensively studied over the past three decades. Recent research has revealed that for forward-backward control systems, the corresponding optimal control problem is inherently time-inconsistent. Consequently, the optimal controls derived in existing literature represent pre-committed solutions rather than dynamically consistent strategies. In this paper, we shift focus from pre-committed solutions to addressing the time-inconsistency issue directly, adopting a dynamic game-theoretic approach to derive equilibrium strategies. Owing to the forward-backward structure, the associated equilibrium Riccati equation (ERE) constitutes a coupled system of matrix-valued, non-local ordinary differential equations with a non-symmetric structure. This non-symmetry introduces fundamental challenges in establishing the solvability of the EREs. We overcome the difficulty by establishing a priori estimates for a combination of the solutions to EREs, which, interestingly, is a representation of the equilibrium value function.</description>

      <title>Optimal Operation and Valuation of Electricity Storages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies computational techniques of convex stochastic optimization to optimal operation and valuation of electricity storages in the face of uncertain electricity prices. Our approach is applicable to various specifications of storages, and it allows for e.g.\ hard constraints on storage capacity and charging speed. Our valuations are based on the indifference pricing principle, which builds on optimal trading strategies and calibrates to the user's initial position, market views and risk preferences. We illustrate the effects of storage capacity and charging speed by numerically computing the valuations using stochastic dual dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>An efficient primal dual semismooth Newton method for semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient semismooth Newton method, named SSNCP, for solving a class of semidefinite programming problems. Our approach is rooted in an equivalent semismooth system derived from the saddle point problem induced by the augmented Lagrangian duality. An additional correction step is incorporated after the semismooth Newton step to ensure that the iterates eventually reside on a manifold where the semismooth system is locally smooth. Global convergence is achieved by carefully designing inexact criteria and leveraging the $\alpha$-averaged property to analyze the error. The correction steps address challenges related to the lack of smoothness in local convergence analysis. Leveraging the smoothness established by the correction steps and assuming a local error bound condition, we establish the local superlinear convergence rate without requiring the stringent assumptions of nonsingularity or strict complementarity. Furthermore, we prove that SSNCP converges to an $\varepsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-3/2})$. Numerical experiments on various datasets, especially the Mittelmann benchmark, demonstrate the high efficiency and robustness of SSNCP compared to state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <title>A constructive approach to strengthen algebraic descriptions of function and operator classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that functions (resp. operators) satisfying a property~$p$ on a subset $Q\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ cannot necessarily be extended to a function (resp. operator) satisfying~$p$ on the whole of~$\mathbb{R}^d$. Given $Q \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, this work considers the problem of obtaining necessary and ideally sufficient conditions to be satisfied by a function (resp. operator) on $Q$, ensuring the existence of an extension of this function (resp. operator) satisfying $p$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  More precisely, given some property $p$, we present a refinement procedure to obtain stronger necessary conditions to be imposed on $Q$. This procedure can be applied iteratively until the stronger conditions are also sufficient. We illustrate the procedure on a few examples, including the strengthening of existing descriptions for the classes of smooth functions satisfying a \L{}ojasiewicz condition, convex blockwise smooth functions, Lipschitz monotone operators, strongly monotone cocoercive operators, and uniformly convex functions.
  In most cases, these strengthened descriptions can be represented, or relaxed, to semi-definite constraints, which can be used to formulate tractable optimization problems on functions (resp. operators) within those classes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with Partial Observations: Stochastic Maximum Principles and Numerical Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a general stochastic maximum principle for partially observed optimal control of semi-linear stochastic partial differential equations in a nonconvex control domain. The state evolves in a Hilbert space driven by a cylindrical Wiener process and finitely many Brownian motions, while observations are in an Euclidean space having correlated noise. For convex control domain and diffusion coefficients in the state being control-independent, numerical algorithms are developed to solve the partially observed optimal control problems using stochastic gradient descent algorithm combined with finite element approximations and the branching filtering algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted for demonstration.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of an Inexact MBA Method for Constrained DC Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns a class of constrained difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problems in which, the constraint functions are continuously differentiable and their gradients are strictly continuous. For such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, we develop an inexact moving balls approximation (MBA) method by a workable inexactness criterion for the solution of subproblems. This criterion is proposed by leveraging a global error bound for the strongly convex program associated with parametric optimization problems. We establish the full convergence of the iterate sequence under the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property of the constructed potential function, achieve the local convergence rate of the iterate and objective value sequences under the KL property of the potential function with exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$, and provide the iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ to seek an $\epsilon$-KKT point. A verifiable condition is also presented to check whether the potential function has the KL property of exponent $q\in[1/2,1)$. To our knowledge, this is the first implementable inexact MBA method with a complete convergence certificate. Numerical comparison with DCA-MOSEK, a DC algorithm with subproblems solved by MOSEK, is conducted on $\ell_1\!-\!\ell_2$ regularized quadratically constrained optimization problems, which demonstrates the advantage of the inexact MBA in the quality of solutions and running time.</description>

      <title>On Solving the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem with Conflicting Edge Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minimum Spanning Tree with Conflicting Edge Pairs is a generalization that adds conflict constraints to a classical optimization problem on graphs used to model several real-world applications. In the last few years several approaches, both heuristic and exact, have been proposed to attack the problem. In this paper we consider a mixed integer linear program never approached before in the context of the problem under investigation, and we solve it with an open-source solver. Computational results on the benchmark instances commonly used in the literature of the problem are reported. The results indicate that the approach we propose, in its simplicity, obtains results aligned with those of the much more sophisticated approaches available. During the experimental campaign 6 instances have been closed for the first time, with 9 improved best-known lower bounds and 16 improved best-known upper bounds over the 230 instances considered.</description>

      <title>On Solving the Set Covering Problem with Conflicts on Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variant of the well-known Set Covering Problem is studied in this paper, where subsets of a collection have to be selected, and pairwise conflicts among subsets of items exist. The selection of each subset has a cost, and the inclusion of conflicting subsets is associated with a penalty to be paid. The problem, which can be used to model real applications, looks for a selection of subsets that cover the original collection, while minimizing the sum of covering and penalty costs. In this paper we consider a compact mixed integer linear program and we solve it with an open-source solver. Computational results on the benchmark instances commonly used in the literature of the problem are reported. The results indicate that the new approach we propose is capable of good results, both in terms of lower and upper bounds, although not matching the state-of-the-art on average. The new approach was, however, able to improve 9 best-known heuristic solutions.</description>

      <title>Moment Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy for Gromov Wasserstein: Continuous Extensions and Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem is an extension of the classical optimal transport problem to settings where the source and target distributions reside in incomparable spaces, and for which a cost function that attributes the price of moving resources is not available. The sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy is a principled method for deriving tractable semidefinite relaxations to generic polynomial optimization problems. In this work, we apply ideas from the moment-SOS hierarchy to solve the GW problem.
  More precisely, we identify extensions of the moment-SOS hierarchy, previously introduced for the discretized GW problem, such that they remain valid for general probability distributions. This process requires a suitable generalization of positive semidefiniteness over finite-dimensional vector spaces to the space of probability distributions. We prove the following properties concerning these continuous extensions: First, these relaxations form a genuine hierarchy in that the optimal value converges to the GW distance. Second, each of these relaxations induces a pseudo-metric over the collection of metric measure spaces. Crucially, unlike the GW problem, these induced instances are tractable to compute -- the discrete analogs are expressible as semidefinite programs and hence are tractable to solve. Separately from these properties, we also establish a statistical consistency result arising from sampling the source and target distributions. Our work suggests fascinating applications of the SOS hierarchy to optimization problems over probability distributions in settings where the objective and constraint depend on these distributions in a polynomial way.</description>

      <title>Output regulation for a reaction-diffusion system with input delay and unknown frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study solves the output regulation problem for a reaction-diffusion system confronting concurrent input delay and fully unidentified disturbances (encompassing both unknown frequencies and amplitudes) across all channels. The principal innovation emerges from a novel adaptive control architecture that synergizes the modal decomposition technique with a dual-observer mechanism, enabling real-time concurrent estimation of unmeasurable system states and disturbances through a state observer and an adaptive disturbance estimator. Unlike existing approaches limited to either delay compensation or partial disturbance rejection, our methodology overcomes the technical barrier of coordinating these two requirements through a rigorously constructed tracking-error-based controller, achieving exponential convergence of system output to reference signals. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed output feedback control strategy.</description>

      <title>Output regulation for an unstable wave equation with output delay and one measurement only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output regulation problem for a one-dimensional unstable wave equation subject to output delay and all-channel disturbances with unknown frequencies and amplitudes. First, this problem is transformed into a stabilization problem for an unstable wave equation with output delay and disturbances by employing regulator equations. Subsequently, a backstepping-based feedforward regulator is proposed to exponentially stabilize this system. To track the states of the unstable wave equation, the time interval is partitioned into two segments. The observers and predictors are designed at these distinct intervals, respectively. Therein, the observers comprise two components: a state observer proposed via dynamic compensators and an adaptive observer designed by the adaptive internal model method. Finally, a novel error-based feedback controller is derived using a single measurement, ensuring exponential convergence of the tracking error to zero. This work establishes the pioneering solution to the output regulation problem for distributed parameter systems (DPS) with output delay. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>A level set topology optimization theory based on Hamilton's principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for deriving the evolution equation of the level set function in topology optimization, departing from conventional Hamilton-Jacobi based formulations. The key idea is the introduction of an auxiliary domain, geometrically identical to the physical design domain, occupied by fictitious matter which is dynamically excited by the conditions prevailing in the design domain. By assigning kinetic and potential energy to this matter and interpreting the level set function as the generalized coordinate to describe its deformation, the governing equation of motion is determined via Hamilton's principle, yielding a modified wave equation. Appropriate combinations of model parameters enable the recovery of classical physical behaviors, including the standard and biharmonic wave equations. The evolution problem is formulated in weak form using variational methods and implemented in the software environment FreeFEM++. The influence of the numerical parameters is analyzed on the example of minimum mean compliance. The results demonstrate that topological complexity and strut design can be effectively controlled by the respective parameters. In addition, the method allows for the nucleation of new holes and eliminates the need for re-initializing the level set function. The inclusion of a damping term further enhances numerical stability. To showcase the versatility and robustness of our method, we also apply it to compliant mechanism design and a bi-objective optimization problem involving self-weight and compliance minimization under local stress constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Splitting methods have emerged as powerful tools to address complex problems by decomposing them into smaller solvable components. In this work, we develop a general approach of forward-backward splitting methods for solving monotone inclusion problems involving both set-valued and single-valued operators, where the latter may lack cocoercivity. Our proposed approach, based on some coefficient matrices, not only encompasses several important existing algorithms but also extends to new ones, offering greater flexibility for different applications. Moreover, by appropriately selecting the coefficient matrices, the resulting algorithms can be implemented in a distributed and decentralized manner.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>

      <title>OPO: Making Decision-Focused Data Acquisition Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for making data acquisition decisions for variables in contextual stochastic optimisation problems. Data acquisition decisions are typically treated as separate and fixed. We explore problem settings in which the acquisition of contextual variables is costly and consequently constrained. The data acquisition problem is often solved heuristically for proxy objectives such as coverage. The more intuitive objective is the downstream decision quality as a result of data acquisition decisions. The whole pipeline can be characterised as an optimise-then-predict-then-optimise (OPO) problem. Analogously, much recent research has focused on how to integrate prediction and optimisation (PO) in the form of decision-focused learning. We propose leveraging differentiable optimisation to extend the integration to data acquisition. We solve the data acquisition problem with well-defined constraints by learning a surrogate linear objective function. We demonstrate an application of this model on a shortest path problem for which we first have to set a drone reconnaissance strategy to capture image segments serving as inputs to a model that predicts travel costs. We ablate the problem with a number of training modalities and demonstrate that the differentiable optimisation approach outperforms random search strategies.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration and Real-Time Operation of Networked Microgrids Under Load Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution networks are increasingly exposed to threats such as extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and cyber risks--resulting in more frequent contingencies and outages, a trend likely to persist. Microgrids, particularly dynamic networked microgrids (DNMGs), offer a promising solution to mitigate the impacts of such contingencies and enhance resiliency. However, distribution networks present unique challenges due to their unbalanced nature and the inherent uncertainty in both loads and generation. This paper builds upon our prior work on the two-stage mixed-integer robust optimization problem for configuring DNMGs, improving the solve time and scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a model-free, real-time optimal power flow algorithm to manage DNMG operations in the time between reconfigurations. A case study on a realistic network based on part of the San Francisco Bay Area demonstrates the scalability of both approaches. The case study also illustrates the ability to maintain power flow feasibility as loads vary and operating conditions change when the methods are used in tandem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive sieving with semismooth Newton proximal augmented Lagrangian algorithm for multi-task Lasso problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task learning enhances model generalization by jointly learning from related tasks. This paper focuses on the $\ell_{1,\infty}$-norm constrained multi-task learning problem, which promotes a shared feature representation while inducing sparsity in task-specific parameters. We propose an adaptive sieving (AS) strategy to efficiently generate a solution path for multi-task Lasso problems. Each subproblem along the path is solved via an inexact semismooth Newton proximal augmented Lagrangian ({\sc Ssnpal}) algorithm, achieving an asymptotically superlinear convergence rate. By exploiting the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the inherent sparsity of multi-task Lasso solutions, the {\sc Ssnpal} algorithm solves a sequence of reduced subproblems with small dimensions. This approach enables our method to scale effectively to large problems. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems are systems which undergo both continuous and discrete transitions. The Bolza problem from optimal control theory is applied to these systems and a hybrid version of Pontryagin's maximum principle is presented. This hybrid maximum principle is presented to emphasize its geometric nature which makes its study amenable to the tools of geometric mechanics and symplectic geometry. One explicit benefit of this geometric approach is that the symplectic structure (and hence the induced volume) is preserved. This allows for a hybrid analog of caustics and conjugate points. Additionally, an introductory analysis of singular solutions (beating and Zeno) is discussed geometrically. This work concludes on a biological example where beating can occur.</description>

      <title>Fully Adaptive Stepsizes: Which System Benefit More -- Centralized or Decentralized?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decentralized optimization, the choice of stepsize plays a critical role in algorithm performance. A common approach is to use a shared stepsize across all agents to ensure convergence. However, selecting an optimal stepsize often requires careful tuning, which can be time-consuming and may lead to slow convergence, especially when there is significant variation in the smoothness (L-smoothness) of local objective functions across agents. Individually tuning stepsizes per agent is also impractical, particularly in large-scale networks. To address these limitations, we propose AdGT, an adaptive gradient tracking method that enables each agent to adjust its stepsize based on the smoothness of its local objective. We prove that AdGT generates a sequence of iterates that converges to the optimal consensus solution. Through numerical experiments, we compare AdGT with fixed-stepsize gradient tracking methods and demonstrate its superior performance. Additionally, we compare AdGT with adaptive gradient descent (AdGD) in a centralized setting and observe that fully adaptive stepsizes offer greater benefits in decentralized networks than in centralized ones.</description>

      <title>Scalable Two-Stage Stochastic Optimal Power Flow via Separable Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by applications in telecommunication networks, we explore the simulation task of estimating rare event probabilities for tandem queues in their steady state. Existing literature has recognized that importance sampling methods can be inefficient, due to the exploding variance of the path-dependent likelihood functions. To mitigate this, we introduce a new importance sampling approach that utilizes a marginal likelihood ratio on the stationary distribution, effectively avoiding the issue of excessive variance. In addition, we design a machine learning algorithm to estimate this marginal likelihood ratio using importance sampling data. Numerical experiments indicate that our algorithm outperforms the classic importance sampling methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods see many uses in optimization problems. Modifications to the algorithm, such as momentum-based SGD methods have been known to produce better results in certain cases. Much of this, however, is due to empirical information rather than rigorous proof. While the dynamics of gradient descent methods can be studied through continuous approximations, existing works only cover scenarios with constant learning rates or SGD without momentum terms. We present approximation results under weak assumptions for SGD that allow learning rates and momentum parameters to vary with respect to time.</description>

      <title>Reducing the set of considered scenarios in robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust optimization is a commonly employed method to mitigate uncertainties in the planning of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). In certain contexts, the large number of uncertainty scenarios makes the robust problem impractically expensive to solve. Recent developments in research on IMPT treatment planning indicate that the number of ideally considered error scenarios may continue to increase.
  In this paper, we therefore investigate methods that reduce the size of the scenario set considered during the robust optimization. Six cases of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are considered. First, we investigate the existence of an optimal subset of scenarios that needs to be considered during robust optimization, and perform experiments to see if the set can be found in a reasonable time and substitute for the full set of scenarios during robust IMPT optimization. We then consider heuristic methods to estimate this subset or find subsets with similar properties. Specifically, we select a subset of maximal diversity in terms of scenario-specific features such as the dose distributions and function gradients at the initial point. Finally, we consider adversarial methods as an alternative to solving the full robust problem and investigate the impact on computation times.
  The results indicate that the optimal subset can be well approximated by solving the robust IMPT problem with conventional methods. Of the methods designed to approximate it within a practically useful time frame, the results of the diversity-maximization methods indicate that they may perform better than a manual selection of scenarios based on the patient geometry. In addition, the adversarial approaches decreased the computation time by at least half compared to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Programming Models for Exact and Interpretable Formulation of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified mixed-integer programming framework for training sparse and interpretable neural networks. We develop exact formulations for both fully connected and convolutional architectures by modeling nonlinearities such as ReLU activations through binary variables and encoding structural sparsity via filter- and layer-level pruning constraints. The resulting models integrate parameter learning, architecture selection, and structural regularization within a single optimization problem, yielding globally optimal solutions with respect to a composite objective that balances prediction accuracy, weight sparsity, and architectural compactness. The mixed-integer programming formulation accommodates piecewise-linear operations, including max pooling and activation gating, and permits precise enforcement of logic-based or domain-specific constraints. By incorporating considerations of interpretability, sparsity, and verifiability directly into the training process, the proposed framework bridges a range of research areas including explainable artificial intelligence, symbolic reasoning, and formal verification.</description>

      <title>Graphical Dominance Analysis for Linear Systems: A Frequency-Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a frequency-domain approach to dominance analysis for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant systems. The dominance of a MIMO system is defined to be the number of its poles in the open right half-plane. Our approach is graphical: we define a frequency-wise notion of the recently-introduced scaled graph of a MIMO system plotted in a complex plane. The scaled graph provides a bound of the eigenloci of the system, which can be viewed as a robust MIMO extension of the classical Nyquist plot. Our main results characterize sufficient conditions for quantifying the dominance of a closed-loop system based upon separation of scaled graphs of two open-loop systems in a frequency-wise manner. The results reconcile existing small gain, small phase and passivity theorems for feedback dominance analysis.</description>

      <title>Soft and Hard Scaled Relative Graphs for Nonlinear Feedback Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents input-output stability analysis of nonlinear feedback systems based on the notion of soft and hard scaled relative graphs (SRGs). The soft and hard SRGs acknowledge the distinction between incremental positivity and incremental passivity and reconcile them from a graphical perspective. The essence of our proposed analysis is that the separation of soft/hard SRGs of two open-loop systems on the complex plane guarantees closed-loop stability. The main results generalize an existing soft SRG separation theorem for bounded open-loop systems which was proved based on interconnection properties of soft SRGs under a chordal assumption. By comparison, our analysis does not require this chordal assumption and applies to possibly unbounded open-loop systems.</description>

      <title>Seeing Through Risk: A Symbolic Approximation of Prospect Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic modeling framework for decision-making under risk that merges interpretability with the core insights of Prospect Theory. Our approach replaces opaque utility curves and probability weighting functions with transparent, effect-size-guided features. We mathematically formalize the method, demonstrate its ability to replicate well-known framing and loss-aversion phenomena, and provide an end-to-end empirical validation on synthetic datasets. The resulting model achieves competitive predictive performance while yielding clear coefficients mapped onto psychological constructs, making it suitable for applications ranging from AI safety to economic policy analysis.</description>

      <title>Sensor Scheduling in Intrusion Detection Games with Uncertain Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sensor scheduling for an intrusion detection task. We model this as a two-player zero-sum game over a graph, where the defender (Player 1) seeks to identify the optimal strategy for scheduling sensor orientations to minimize the probability of missed detection at minimal cost, while the intruder (Player 2) aims to identify the optimal path selection strategy to maximize missed detection probability at minimal cost. The defender's strategy space grows exponentially with the number of sensors, making direct computation of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies computationally expensive. To tackle this, we propose a distributed variant of the Weighted Majority algorithm that exploits the structure of the game's payoff matrix, enabling efficient computation of the NE strategies with provable convergence guarantees. Next, we consider a more challenging scenario where the defender lacks knowledge of the true sensor models and, consequently, the game's payoff matrix. For this setting, we develop online learning algorithms that leverage bandit feedback from sensors to estimate the NE strategies. By building on existing results from perturbation theory and online learning in matrix games, we derive high-probability order-optimal regret bounds for our algorithms. Finally, through simulations, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithms in both known and unknown payoff scenarios.</description>

      <title>AltGDmin: Alternating GD and Minimization for Partly-Decoupled (Federated) Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes a novel optimization solution framework, called alternating gradient descent (GD) and minimization (AltGDmin), that is useful for many problems for which alternating minimization (AltMin) is a popular solution. AltMin is a special case of the block coordinate descent algorithm that is useful for problems in which minimization w.r.t one subset of variables keeping the other fixed is closed form or otherwise reliably solved. Denote the two blocks/subsets of the optimization variables Z by Za, Zb, i.e., Z = {Za, Zb}. AltGDmin is often a faster solution than AltMin for any problem for which (i) the minimization over one set of variables, Zb, is much quicker than that over the other set, Za; and (ii) the cost function is differentiable w.r.t. Za. Often, the reason for one minimization to be quicker is that the problem is ``decoupled" for Zb and each of the decoupled problems is quick to solve. This decoupling is also what makes AltGDmin communication-efficient for federated settings.
  Important examples where this assumption holds include (a) low rank column-wise compressive sensing (LRCS), low rank matrix completion (LRMC), (b) their outlier-corrupted extensions such as robust PCA, robust LRCS and robust LRMC; (c) phase retrieval and its sparse and low-rank model based extensions; (d) tensor extensions of many of these problems such as tensor LRCS and tensor completion; and (e) many partly discrete problems where GD does not apply -- such as clustering, unlabeled sensing, and mixed linear regression. LRCS finds important applications in multi-task representation learning and few shot learning, federated sketching, and accelerated dynamic MRI. LRMC and robust PCA find important applications in recommender systems, computer vision and video analytics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate provable (sub)exponential quantum speedups in both discrete and continuous optimization, achieved through simple and natural quantum optimization algorithms, namely the quantum adiabatic algorithm for discrete optimization and quantum Hamiltonian descent for continuous optimization. Our result builds on the Gily\'en--Hastings--Vazirani (sub)exponential oracle separation for adiabatic quantum computing. With a sequence of perturbative reductions, we compile their construction into two standalone objective functions, whose oracles can be directly leveraged by the plain adiabatic evolution and Schr\"odinger operator evolution for discrete and continuous optimization, respectively.</description>

      <title>An $rp$-adaptive method for accurate resolution of shock-dominated viscous flow based on implicit shock tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an optimization-based $rp$-adaptive numerical method to approximate solutions of viscous, shock-dominated flows using implicit shock tracking and a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization on traditionally coarse grids without nonlinear stabilization (e.g., artificial viscosity or limiting). The proposed method adapts implicit shock tracking methods, originally developed to align mesh faces with solution discontinuities, to compress elements into viscous shocks and boundary layers, functioning as a novel approach to aggressive $r$-adaptation. This form of $r$-adaptation is achieved naturally as the minimizer of the enriched residual with respect to the discrete flow variables and coordinates of the nodes of the grid. Several innovations to the shock tracking optimization solver are proposed to ensure sufficient mesh compression at viscous features to render stabilization unnecessary, including residual weighting, step constraints and modifications, and viscosity-based continuation. Finally, $p$-adaptivity is used to locally increase the polynomial degree with three clear benefits: (1) lessens the mesh compression requirements near shock waves and boundary layers, (2) reduces the error in regions where $r$-adaptivity is not sufficient with the given grid topology, and (3) reduces computational cost by performing a majority of the $r$-adaptivity iterations on the coarsest discretization. A series of numerical experiments show the proposed method effectively resolves viscous, shock-dominated flows, including accurate prediction of heat flux profiles produced by hypersonic flow over a cylinder, and compares favorably in terms of accuracy per degree of freedom to $h$-adaptation with a high-order discretization.</description>

      <title>On the facet pivot simplex method for linear programming II: a linear iteration bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hirsch Conjecture stated that any $d$-dimensional polytope with n facets has a diameter at most equal to $n - d$. This conjecture was disproved by Santos (A counterexample to the Hirsch Conjecture, Annals of Mathematics, 172(1) 383-412, 2012). The implication of Santos' work is that all {\it vertex} pivot algorithms cannot solve the linear programming problem in the worst case in $n - d$ vertex pivot iterations.
  In the first part of this series of papers, we proposed a {\it facet} pivot method. In this paper, we show that the proposed facet pivot method can solve the canonical linear programming problem in the worst case in at most $n-d$ facet pivot iterations. This work was inspired by Smale's Problem 9 (Mathematical problems for the next century, In Arnold, V. I.; Atiyah, M.; Lax, P.; Mazur, B. Mathematics: frontiers and perspectives, American Mathematical Society, 271-294, 1999).</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Gradient Descent for Overparameterized Nonconvex Burer--Monteiro Factorization with Global Optimality Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider using gradient descent to minimize the nonconvex function $f(X)=\phi(XX^{T})$ over an $n\times r$ factor matrix $X$, in which $\phi$ is an underlying smooth convex cost function defined over $n\times n$ matrices. While only a second-order stationary point $X$ can be provably found in reasonable time, if $X$ is additionally rank deficient, then its rank deficiency certifies it as being globally optimal. This way of certifying global optimality necessarily requires the search rank $r$ of the current iterate $X$ to be overparameterized with respect to the rank $r^{\star}$ of the global minimizer $X^{\star}$. Unfortunately, overparameterization significantly slows down the convergence of gradient descent, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r&gt;r^{\star}$, even when $\phi$ is strongly convex. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive preconditioner that restores the convergence rate of gradient descent back to linear in the overparameterized case, while also making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the global minimizer $X^{\star}$.</description>

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization studies the process of seeking multiple competing desiderata in some operation. Solution techniques highlight marginal tradeoffs associated with weighing one objective over others. In this paper, we consider time-varying multi-objective optimization, in which the objectives are parametrized by a continuously varying parameter and a prescribed computational budget is available at each time instant to algorithmically adjust the decision variables to accommodate for the changes. We prove regret bounds indicating the relative guarantees on performance for the competing objectives.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Adaptive Gradient Algorithms for Nonconvex-PL Minimax Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimax optimization recently is widely applied in many machine learning tasks such as generative adversarial networks, robust learning and reinforcement learning. In the paper, we study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization with nonsmooth regularization, where the objective function is possibly nonconvex on primal variable $x$, and it is nonconcave and satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on dual variable $y$. Moreover, we propose a class of enhanced momentum-based gradient descent ascent methods (i.e., MSGDA and AdaMSGDA) to solve these stochastic nonconvex-PL minimax problems. In particular, our AdaMSGDA algorithm can use various adaptive learning rates in updating the variables $x$ and $y$ without relying on any specifical types. Theoretically, we prove that our methods have the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ only requiring one sample at each loop in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Some numerical experiments on PL-game and Wasserstein-GAN demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>The Value of Ancillary Services for Electrolyzers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although primarily designed for hydrogen production, electrolyzers can support power systems by providing various ancillary services, opening new revenue streams that enhance their economic viability. This paper investigates the participation of an electrolyzer in frequency-supporting reserve markets, analyzing how bid structures and activation intensities affect its value. We develop a mixed-integer linear program to co-optimize electricity procurement and reserve provision, and analytically derive the opportunity cost of reserve provision, which determines the optimal bid price. Using historical price and frequency data from western Denmark, we show that asymmetric, hourly reserve products often entail no opportunity cost and can increase profits by up to 47%. However, energy-intensive reserves may disrupt hydrogen production and risk unmet demand. Our findings reveal that flexible bidding can mitigate these risks while maintaining profitability. We also highlight the benefits of diversifying across reserve products and offer two recommendations: System operators should reconsider reserve bid structures to better accommodate electrolyzers, and electrolyzer owners should not overlook energy-intensive reserve services when hydrogen demand is flexible.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the feasible region of a standard conic program represented as the intersection of a closed convex cone and a set of linear equalities. It is recently shown that when Slater constraint qualification (strict feasibility) fails for the classes of linear and semidefinite programs, two key properties emerge within the feasible region; (a) every point in the feasible region is degenerate; (b) the constraint system inherits implicit redundancies. In this paper we show that degeneracy and implicit redundancies are inherent and universal traits of all conic programs in the absence of strict feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal transport and Wasserstein barycenter of Gaussian distributions have been solved. In literature, the closed form formulas of the Monge map, the Wasserstein distance and the Wasserstein barycenter have been given. Moreover, when Gaussian distributions extend more generally to elliptically contoured distributions, similar results also hold true. In this case, Gaussian distributions are regarded as elliptically contoured distribution with generator function $e^{-x/2}$. However, there are few results about optimal transport for elliptically contoured distributions with different generator functions. In this paper, we degenerate elliptically contoured distributions to radially contoured distributions and study their optimal transport and prove their Wasserstein barycenter is still radially contoured. For general elliptically contoured distributions, we give two numerical counterexamples to show that the Wasserstein barycenter of elliptically contoured distributions does not have to be elliptically contoured.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for general nonlinear conic programming which does not require the knowledge of the full cone, but rather a simpler, more tractable, approximation of it. We prove that the algorithm satisfies a strong global convergence property in the sense that it generates a strong sequential optimality condition. In particular, a KKT point is necessarily found when a limit point satisfies Robinson's condition. We conduct numerical experiments minimizing nonlinear functions subject to a copositive cone constraint. In order to do this, we consider a well known polyhedral approximation of this cone by means of refining the polyhedral constraints after each augmented Lagrangian iteration. We show that our strategy outperforms the standard approach of considering a close polyhedral approximation of the full copositive cone in every iteration.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Facility Location Optimization: A Novel Integer Programming Formulation and Approaches to Heuristic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attack the 4-level facility location problem (4L-FLP), a critical component in supply chains. Foundational tasks here involve selecting markets, plants, warehouses, and distribution centers to maximize profits while considering related constraints. Based on a variation of the quadratic assignment problem, we propose a novel integer programming formula that significantly reduces the variables. Our model incorporates several realistic features, including transportation costs and upper bounds on facilities at each level. It accounts for one-time fixed costs associated with selecting each facility. To solve this complex problem, we develop and experimentally test two solution procedures: a multi-start greedy heuristic and a multi-start tabu search. We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses on the results to assess the reliability of proposed algorithms. This study contributes to improved solution methods for large-scale 4L-FLPs, providing a valuable tool for supply chain maturity.</description>

Abstract: Algorithms for bilevel optimization often encounter Hessian computations, which are prohibitive in high dimensions. While recent works offer first-order methods for unconstrained bilevel problems, the constrained setting remains relatively underexplored. We present first-order linearly constrained optimization methods with finite-time hypergradient stationarity guarantees. For linear equality constraints, we attain $\epsilon$-stationarity in $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ gradient oracle calls, which is nearly-optimal. For linear inequality constraints, we attain $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationarity in $\widetilde{O}(d{\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3}})$ gradient oracle calls, where $d$ is the upper-level dimension. Finally, we obtain for the linear inequality setting dimension-free rates of $\widetilde{O}({\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-4}})$ oracle complexity under the additional assumption of oracle access to the optimal dual variable. Along the way, we develop new nonsmooth nonconvex optimization methods with inexact oracles. We verify these guarantees with preliminary numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>$A^*$ for Graphs of Convex Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel algorithm that fuses the existing convex-programming based approach with heuristic information to find optimality guarantees and near-optimal paths for the Shortest Path Problem in the Graph of Convex Sets (SPP-GCS). Our method, inspired by $A^*$, initiates a best-first-like procedure from a designated subset of vertices and iteratively expands it until further growth is neither possible nor beneficial. Traditionally, obtaining solutions with bounds for an optimization problem involves solving a relaxation, modifying the relaxed solution to a feasible one, and then comparing the two solutions to establish bounds. However, for SPP-GCS, we demonstrate that reversing this process can be more advantageous, especially with Euclidean travel costs. In other words, we initially employ $A^*$ to find a feasible solution for SPP-GCS, then solve a convex relaxation restricted to the vertices explored by $A^*$ to obtain a relaxed solution, and finally, compare the solutions to derive bounds. We present numerical results to highlight the advantages of our algorithm over the existing approach in terms of the sizes of the convex programs solved and computation time.</description>

      <title>Explicit solution to an optimal two-player switching game in infinite horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use viscosity approach to provide an explicit solution to the problem of a two - player switching game. We characterize the switching regions which reduce the switching problem into one of finding a finite number of threshold values in state process that would trigger switchings and then derive an explicit solution to this problem. The state process is a one dimensional It\^o diffusion process and switching costs are allowed to be non-positive. We also suggest a numerical procedure to compute the value function in case we know the qualitative structure of switching regions and we illustrate our results by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We study the exact null controllability of a class of non-autonomous conformable fractional semi-linear evolution systems with nonlocal initial conditions in Hilbert spaces. The analysis is carried out within the framework of conformable fractional calculus and linear evolution operator theory. Under suitable assumptions, we establish the existence of mild solutions and provide sufficient conditions for exact null controllability. Notably, the nonlocal term is allowed to be continuous without requiring compactness or Lipschitz-type conditions. An example is included to illustrate the applicability of the main results.</description>

      <title>Solvability of Equilibrium Riccati Equations: A Direct Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solvability of equilibrium Riccati equations (EREs) plays a central role in the study of time-inconsistent stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problems, because it paves the way to constructing a closed-loop equilibrium strategy. Under the standard conditions, Yong [29] established its well-posedness by introducing the well-known multi-person differential game method. However, this method depends on the dynamic programming principle (DPP) of the sophisticated problems on every subinterval, and thus is essentially a control theory approach. In this paper, we shall give a new and more direct proof, in which the DPP is no longer needed. We first establish a priori estimates for the ERE in the case of smooth coefficients. Using this estimate, we then demonstrate both the local and global solvability of the ERE by constructing an appropriate Picard iteration sequence, which actually provides a numerical algorithm. Additionally, a mollification method is employed to handle the case with non-smooth coefficients.</description>

      <title>Convexoid: A Minimal Theory of Conjugate Convexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key idea in convex optimization theory is to use well-structured affine functions to approximate general functions, leading to impactful developments in conjugate functions and convex duality theory. This raises the question: what are the minimal requirements to establish these results? This paper aims to address this inquiry through a carefully crafted system called the convexoid. We demonstrate that fundamental constructs, such as conjugate functions and subdifferentials, along with their relationships, can be derived within this minimal system. Building on this, we define the associated duality systems and develop conditions for weak and strong duality, generalizing the classic results from conjugate duality and radial duality theories. Due to its flexibility, our framework supports various approximation schemes, including approximating general functions using symmetric-conic, bilinear, radial, or piecewise constant functions, and representing general structures such as graphs, set systems, fuzzy sets, or toposes using special membership functions. The associated duality results for these systems also open new opportunities for establishing bounds on objective values and verifying structural properties.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gradient Normalization and Independent Sampling for (Stochastic) Generalized-Smooth Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that many nonconvex machine learning problems satisfy a generalized-smooth condition that extends beyond traditional smooth nonconvex optimization. However, the existing algorithms are not fully adapted to such generalized-smooth nonconvex geometry and encounter significant technical limitations on their convergence analysis. In this work, we first analyze the convergence of adaptively normalized gradient descent under function geometries characterized by generalized-smoothness and generalized P{\L} condition, revealing the advantage of adaptive gradient normalization. Our results provide theoretical insights into adaptive normalization across various scenarios.For stochastic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization, we propose \textbf{I}ndependent-\textbf{A}daptively \textbf{N}ormalized \textbf{S}tochastic \textbf{G}radient \textbf{D}escent, which leverages adaptive gradient normalization, independent sampling, and gradient clipping to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity under relaxed noise assumptions. Experiments on large-scale nonconvex generalized-smooth problems demonstrate the fast convergence of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Contractivity and linear convergence in bilinear saddle-point problems: An operator-theoretic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convex-concave bilinear saddle-point problem $\min_x \max_y f(x) + y^\top Ax - g(y)$, where both, only one, or none of the functions $f$ and $g$ are strongly convex, and suitable rank conditions on the matrix $A$ hold. The solution of this problem is at the core of many machine learning tasks. By employing tools from monotone operator theory, we systematically prove the contractivity (in turn, the linear convergence) of several first-order primal-dual algorithms, including the Chambolle-Pock method. Our approach results in concise proofs, and it yields new convergence guarantees and tighter bounds compared to known results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the invariance of observability for the observed backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with constant coefficients, relative to the filtered probability space. This signifies that the observability of these observed BSDEs with constant coefficients remains unaffected by the selection of the filtered probability space. As an illustrative application, we demonstrate that for stochastic control systems with constant coefficients, weak observability, approximate null controllability with cost, and stabilizability are equivalent across some or any filtered probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning SSP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adaptive controller is proposed and analyzed for the class of infinite-horizon optimal control problems in positive linear systems presented in (Ohlin et al., 2024b). This controller is derived from the solution of a "data-driven algebraic equation" constructed using the model-free Bellman equation from Q-learning. The equation is driven by data correlation matrices that do not scale with the number of data points, enabling efficient online implementation. Consequently, a sufficient condition guaranteeing stability and robustness to unmodeled dynamics is established. The derived results also provide a quantitative characterization of the interplay between excitation level and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal control problems considered here is equivalent to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest path, as demonstrated in the numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Redefining Coherent Risk Measures: From Gauge Optimization to Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well understood that each coherent risk measure can be represented as the expectation with respect to the worst-case reweighted density function, chosen from an abstract risk envelope. This paper introduces an equivalent but more explicit definition of the risk envelope that uses gauge sets (i.e., a type of convex sets widely utilized in convex analysis and gauge optimization) to provide a generalized measure of distance between any reweighting function and the nominal one. Using the primal gauge set reweighting problem, we provide a unified framework for various existing methods in optimization under uncertainty, including risk-neutral/risk-averse stochastic programming, robust optimization, and distributionally robust optimization with moment-based and distance-based ambiguity sets. On the other hand, the associated dual problem offers an intuitive interpretation from the regularization perspective. This approach not only simplifies the derivation of classic results but also provides a versatile framework for robustness design via manipulations of the gauge sets (e.g., intersection, union, summation, convex combination, and function basis enforcement). To demonstrate this flexibility, we present approaches for customizing robustness to specific managerial needs, including methods for selecting flexible tail behaviors, addressing spatial distributional ambiguities, combining multiple robustness metrics, and achieving heterogeneous distributional robustness. We also discuss general reformulation techniques and computational approaches for this unified framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17012v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization and obtain results concerning existence of solution and satisfaction of the competitive condition and transversality condition being unconditionally sufficient for optimality of a trajectory. We also show that under some mild restrictions the optimal trajectory satisfies the Euler condition and a related transversality condition. The optimal trajectory satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming. Under an additional convexity assumption for the two-period constraint sets, we show that the optimal value function is concave and continuous. Linearity bites when it comes to the definition of optimal decision rules which can no longer be guaranteed to be single-valued. We show that if all the two-period constraint sets are convex, then the optimal decision rule is an upper semi-continuous correspondence. For linear cake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value function and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We also introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain a necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems. We show that for a class of linear dynamic optimization problems, known as interlinked linear dynamic optimization problems, a slightly modified version of the functional equation of dynamic programming is satisfied.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Interpretation of the Internal Model Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of linear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control theory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under suitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class of external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a model of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals counteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also in cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive agents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent) models its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed behaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed in cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in standard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model principle and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by categorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of ``model'' generalising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of model is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that it can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This result is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories, a notion of ``interpretation'', describing when a system can be interpreted as performing Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.</description>

      <title>Scheduling problem of aircrafts on a same runway and dual runways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the scheduling problems of landing and takeoff aircraft on a same runway and on dual runways are addressed. In contrast to the approaches based on mixed-integer optimization models in existing works, our approach focuses on the minimum separation times between aircraft by introducing some necessary assumptions and new concepts including relevance, breakpoint aircraft, path and class-monotonically-decreasing sequence. Four scheduling problems are discussed including landing scheduling problem, takeoff scheduling problem, and mixed landing and takeoff scheduling problems on a same runway and on dual runways with the consideration of conversions between different aircraft sequences in typical scenarios. Two real-time optimal algorithms are proposed for the four scheduling problems by fully exploiting the combinations of different classes of aircraft, and necessary definitions, lemmas and theorems are presented for the optimal convergence of the algorithms. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In particular, when $100$ aircraft are considered, by using the algorithm in this paper, the optimal solution can be obtained in less than $5$ seconds, while by using the CPLEX software to solve the mix-integer optimization model, the optimal solution cannot be obtained within $1$ hour.</description>

      <title>Optimal protection and vaccination against epidemics with reinfection risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal allocation of vaccination and protection measures for the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected (SIRI) epidemiological model, which generalizes the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological models by allowing for reinfection. We first introduce the controlled SIRI dynamical model, and discuss the existence and stability of the equilibrium points. We then formulate a finite-horizon optimal control problem where the cost of vaccination and protection is proportional to the mass of population that adopts it. Our main contribution in this work arises from a detailed investigation into the existence/non-existence of singular control inputs, and establishing optimality of bang-bang controls. The optimality of bang-bang control is established by solving an optimal control problem with a running cost that is linear with respect to the input variables. The input variables are associated with actions including vaccination and imposition of protective measures, e.g. masking or isolation. In contrast to most prior works, we rigorously establish the non-existence of singular controls, i.e., the optimality of bang-bang control for our SIRI model. Under the assumption that the reinfection rate exceeds the first-time infection rate, we characterize the structure of both the optimal control inputs, and establish that the vaccination control input admits a bang-bang structure. Numerical results provide valuable insights into the evolution of the disease spread under optimal control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic momentum ADMM for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization with application to PnP algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes SMADMM, a single-loop Stochastic Momentum Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for solving a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth composite optimization problems. SMADMM achieves the optimal oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ in the online setting. Unlike previous stochastic ADMM algorithms that require large mini-batches or a double-loop structure, SMADMM uses only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ stochastic gradient evaluations per iteration and avoids costly restarts. To further improve practicality, we incorporate dynamic step sizes and penalty parameters, proving that SMADMM maintains its optimal complexity without the need for large initial batches. We also develop PnP-SMADMM by integrating plug-and-play priors, and establish its theoretical convergence under mild assumptions. Extensive experiments on classification, CT image reconstruction, and phase retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing stochastic ADMM methods both in accuracy and efficiency, validating our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Regret Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) is a popular framework for decision-making under uncertainty, but its adversarial nature can lead to overly conservative solutions. To address this, we study ex-ante Distributionally Robust Regret Optimization (DRRO), focusing on Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets which are popular due to their links to regularization and machine learning. We provide a systematic analysis of Wasserstein DRRO, paralleling known results for Wasserstein DRO. Under smoothness and regularity conditions, we show that Wasserstein DRRO coincides with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) up to first-order terms, and exactly so in convex quadratic settings. We revisit the Wasserstein DRRO newsvendor problem, where the loss is the maximum of two linear functions of demand and decision. Extending [25], we show that the regret can be computed by maximizing two one-dimensional concave functions. For more general loss functions involving the maximum of multiple linear terms in multivariate random variables and decision vectors, we prove that computing the regret and thus also the DRRO policy is NP-hard. We then propose a convex relaxation for these more general Wasserstein DRRO problems and demonstrate its strong empirical performance. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the optimality gap of our relaxation and show it improves over recent alternatives.</description>

      <title>Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Service Patrolling for Real-time Incident Management during High-impact Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the Traffic Adaptive Moving-window Patrolling Algorithm (TAMPA), designed to improve real-time incident management during major events like sports tournaments and concerts. Such events significantly stress transportation networks, requiring efficient and adaptive patrol solutions. TAMPA integrates predictive traffic modeling and real-time complaint estimation, dynamically optimizing patrol deployment. Using dynamic programming, the algorithm continuously adjusts patrol strategies within short planning windows, effectively balancing immediate response and efficient routing. Leveraging the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, TAMPA detects significant shifts in complaint patterns, triggering proactive adjustments in patrol routes. Theoretical analyses ensure performance remains closely aligned with optimal solutions. Simulation results from an urban traffic network demonstrate TAMPA's superior performance, showing improvements of approximately 87.5\% over stationary methods and 114.2\% over random strategies. Future work includes enhancing adaptability and incorporating digital twin technology for improved predictive accuracy, particularly relevant for events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup at MetLife Stadium.</description>

      <title>Large Banks and Systemic Risk: Insights from a Mean-Field Game Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic game framework to analyze the role of large banks in interbank markets. By extending existing models, we incorporate a large bank as a dynamic decision-maker interacting with multiple small banks. Using the mean-field game methodology and convex analysis, best-response trading strategies are derived, leading to an approximate equilibrium for the interbank market. We investigate the influence of the large bank on the market stability by examining individual default probabilities and systemic risk, through the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Our findings reveal that, when the size of the major bank is not excessively large, it can positively contribute to market stability. However, there is also the potential for negative spillover effects in the event of default, leading to an increase in systemic risk. The magnitude of this impact is further influenced by the size and trading rate of the major bank. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the management of systemic risk in interbank markets.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model reduction of dynamical systems with root mean squared error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>4+3 Phases of Compute-Optimal Neural Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the solvable neural scaling model with three parameters: data complexity, target complexity, and model-parameter-count. We use this neural scaling model to derive new predictions about the compute-limited, infinite-data scaling law regime. To train the neural scaling model, we run one-pass stochastic gradient descent on a mean-squared loss. We derive a representation of the loss curves which holds over all iteration counts and improves in accuracy as the model parameter count grows. We then analyze the compute-optimal model-parameter-count, and identify 4 phases (+3 subphases) in the data-complexity/target-complexity phase-plane. The phase boundaries are determined by the relative importance of model capacity, optimizer noise, and embedding of the features. We furthermore derive, with mathematical proof and extensive numerical evidence, the scaling-law exponents in all of these phases, in particular computing the optimal model-parameter-count as a function of floating point operation budget.</description>

      <title>Interior Point Methods for Structured Quantum Relative Entropy Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum relative entropy optimization refers to a class of convex problems in which a linear functional is minimized over an affine section of the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy function. Recently, the self-concordance of a natural barrier function was proved for this set, and various implementations of interior-point methods have been made available to solve this class of optimization problems. In this paper, we show how common structures arising from applications in quantum information theory can be exploited to improve the efficiency of solving quantum relative entropy optimization problems using interior-point methods. First, we show that the natural barrier function for the epigraph of the quantum relative entropy composed with positive linear operators is self-concordant, even when these linear operators map to singular matrices. Compared to modelling problems using the full quantum relative entropy cone, this allows us to remove redundant log-determinant expressions from the barrier function and reduce the overall barrier parameter. Second, we show how certain slices of the quantum relative entropy cone exhibit useful properties which should be exploited whenever possible to perform certain key steps of interior-point methods more efficiently. We demonstrate how these methods can be applied to applications in quantum information theory, including quantifying quantum key rates, quantum rate-distortion functions, quantum channel capacities, and the ground state energy of Hamiltonians. Our numerical results show that these techniques improve computation times by up to several orders of magnitude, and allow previously intractable problems to be solved.</description>

      <title>A network based approach for unbalanced optimal transport on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach to address the dynamic unbalanced optimal transport problem on surfaces with point cloud representation. For surfaces with point cloud representation, traditional method is difficult to apply due to the difficulty of mesh generating. Neural network is easy to implement even for complicate geometry. Moreover, instead of solving the original dynamic formulation, we consider the Hamiltonian flow approach, i.e. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system. Based on this approach, we can exploit mathematical structure of the optimal transport to construct the neural network and the loss function can be simplified. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted for surfaces with different geometry. We also test the method for point cloud with noise, which shows stability of this method. This method is also easy to generalize to diverse range of problems.</description>

      <title>Minimization of the Pseudospectral Abscissa of a Quadratic Matrix Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on parameters and a given tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa over the set of permissible parameter values is discussed, with applications in damping optimization and brake squeal reductions in mind. An approach is introduced that is based on nonsmooth and global optimization (or smooth optimization techniques such as BFGS if there are many parameters) equipped with a globally convergent criss-cross algorithm to compute the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa objective when the matrix polynomial is of small size. For the setting when the matrix polynomial is large, a subspace framework is introduced, and it is argued formally that it solves the minimization problem globally. The subspace framework restricts the parameter-dependent matrix polynomial to small subspaces, and thus solves the minimization problem for such restricted small matrix polynomials. It then expands the subspaces using the minimizers for the restricted polynomials. The proposed approach makes the global minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa possible for a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on a few parameters and for sizes up to at least a few hundreds. This is illustrated on several examples originating from damping optimization.</description>

      <title>A Retention-Centric Framework for Continual Learning with Guaranteed Model Developmental Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, learning-enabled systems often undergo iterative model development to address challenging or emerging tasks, which involve collecting new data, training a new model and validating the model. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose good capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. While existing continual learning aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance, it often falls short in cost-sensitive applications, where failing to preserve essential established capabilities introduces unforeseen costs and risks and substantial expenses for re-improving these capabilities. To address this issue, we impose a requirement on learning systems to ensure that a new model strictly retains important capabilities of the old model while improving target-task performance, which we term model developmental safety. To ensure model developmental safety, we propose a retention-centric framework with data-dependent constraints, and study how to continually develop a pretrained CLIP model for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees and use its insights to finetune the CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Experiments on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets validate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21676v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions via Minkowski Operations for Safe Navigation among Polytopic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safely navigating around obstacles while respecting the dynamics, control, and geometry of the underlying system is a key challenge in robotics. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) generate safe control policies by considering system dynamics and geometry when calculating safe forward-invariant sets. Existing CBF-based methods often rely on conservative shape approximations, like spheres or ellipsoids, which have explicit and differentiable distance functions. In this paper, we propose an optimization-defined CBF that directly considers the exact Signed Distance Function (SDF) between a polytopic robot and polytopic obstacles. Inspired by the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, we formulate both (i) minimum distance and (ii) penetration depth between polytopic sets as convex optimization problems in the space of Minkowski difference operations (the MD-space). Convenient geometric properties of the MD-space enable the derivatives of implicit SDF between two polytopes to be computed via differentiable optimization. We demonstrate the proposed framework in three scenarios including pure translation, initialization inside an unsafe set, and multi-obstacle avoidance. These three scenarios highlight the generation of a non-conservative maneuver, a recovery after starting in collision, and the consideration of multiple obstacles via pairwise CBF constraint, respectively.</description>
