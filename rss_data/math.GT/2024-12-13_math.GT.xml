      <title>Lengths of saddle connections on random translation surfaces of large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the distribution of the number of saddle connections on a random translation surface of large genus. More specifically, for genus $g$ going to infinity, the number of saddle connections with lengths in a given interval $[\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}]$ converges in distribution to a Poisson distributed random variable. Furthermore, the numbers of saddle connections associated to disjoint intervals are independent.</description>

      <title>Free ribbon lemma for surface-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A free surface-link is a surface-link whose fundamental group is a free group not necessarily meridian-based. Free ribbon lemma says that every free sphere-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon sphere-link. Four different proofs of Free ribbon lemma are explained. The first proof is done in an earlier paper. The second proof is done by showing that there is an O2-handle basis of a ribbon surface-link. The third proof is done by removing the commuter relations from a Wirtinger presentation of a free group, which a paper on another proof of Free ribbon lemma complements. The fourth proof is given by the special case of the proof of the result that every free surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is a stabilization of a free ribbon sphere-link. As a consequence, it is shown that a surface-link is a sublink of a free surface-link if and only if it is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Q-sliceness of strongly invertible knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of equivariant $\mathbb{Q}$-sliceness for strongly invertible knots. On the constructive side, we prove that every Klein amphichiral knot, which is a strongly invertible knot admitting a compatible negative amphichiral involution, is equivariant $\mathbb{Q}$-slice in a single $\mathbb{Q}$-homology $4$-ball, by refining Kawauchi's construction and generalizing Levine's uniqueness result. On the obstructive side, we show that the equivariant version of the classical Fox-Milnor condition, proved recently by the first author, also obstructs equivariant $\mathbb{Q}$-sliceness. We then introduce the equivariant $\mathbb{Q}$-concordance group and study the natural maps between concordance groups as an application. We also list some open problems for future study.</description>

      <title>GeLoRA: Geometric Adaptive Ranks For Efficient LoRA Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Inscriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every smooth Jordan curve $\gamma \subset \mathbb{C}$ and for every set $Q \subset \mathbb{C}$ of six concyclic points, there exists a non-constant quadratic polynomial $p \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ such that $p(Q) \subset \gamma$. The proof relies on a theorem of Fukaya and Irie. We also prove that if $Q$ is the union of the vertex sets of two concyclic regular $n$-gons, there exists a non-constant polynomial $p \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ of degree at most $n-1$ such that $p(Q) \subset \gamma$. The proof is based on a computation in Floer homology. These results support a conjecture about which point sets $Q \subset \mathbb{C}$ admit a polynomial inscription of a given degree into every smooth Jordan curve $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>A lower bound for the volumes of modular link complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every finite collection of oriented closed geodesics in the modular surface has a canonically associated link in its unit tangent bundle coming from the periodic orbits of the geodesic flow. We study the volume of the associated link complement with respect to its unique complete hyperbolic metric. We provide the first lower volume bound that is linear in terms of the number of distinct exponents in the code words corresponding to the collection of closed geodesics.</description>

      <title>The Benard-Conway invariant of two-component links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Benard-Conway invariant of links in the 3-sphere is a Casson-Lin type invariant defined by counting irreducible SU(2) representations of the link group with fixed meridional traces. For two-component links with linking number one, the invariant has been shown to equal a symmetrized multivariable link signature. We extend this result to all two-component links with non-zero linking number. A key ingredient in the proof is an explicit calculation of the Benard-Conway invariant for (2, 2n)-torus links with the help of the Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>An invitation to Culler-Shalen theory in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal work of Culler and Shalen from 1983, essential surfaces in 3-manifolds are associated to ideal points of their $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character varieties, and connections between the algebraic geometry of the character variety and the topology of the 3-manifold are established via group actions on trees. Here, we lay a general foundation for this theory in arbitrary characteristic by using the same approach instead over an arbitrary algebraically closed field. Examples include a change in the $A$-polynomial in characteristic 2, a closed Haken hyperbolic 3-manifold with no detected essential surface, and a closed Haken hyperbolic 3-manifold with an essential surface only detected in characteristic 2.</description>

      <title>Stable local dynamics: expansion, quasi-conformality and ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.09259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study stable ergodicity of the action of groups of diffeomorphisms on smooth manifolds. Such actions are known to exist only on one-dimensional manifolds. The aim of this paper is to introduce a geometric method to overcome this restriction and to construct higher dimensional examples. In particular, we show that every closed manifold admits stably ergodic finitely generated group actions by diffeomorphisms of class $C^{1+\alpha}$. We also prove the stable ergodicity of certain algebraic actions, including the natural action of a generic pair of matrices near the identity on a sphere of arbitrary dimension. These are consequences of the quasi-conformal blender, a local and stable mechanism/phenomenon introduced in this paper, which encapsulates our method for proving stable local ergodicity by providing quasi-conformal orbits with fine controlled geometry. The quasi-conformal blender is developed in the context of pseudo-semigroup actions of locally defined smooth diffeomorphisms, which allows for applications in diverse settings.</description>
