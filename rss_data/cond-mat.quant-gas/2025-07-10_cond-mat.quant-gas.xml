      <title>Vestigial Order Melting of a Chiral Atomic Superfluid in a Double-Valley Optical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of vestigial orders in multi-orbital superfluids have been attracting continuous research interests in both cold atoms and condensed matter systems, as it provides valuable insights into the high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we experimentally investigate thermal phase transitions in a Floquet-engineered double-valley bandstructure realized with ultracold bosonic atoms in a shaken optical lattice. The system exhibits both U(1) and time-reversal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and in the ground state, it forms a chiral superfluid with the Bose-Einstein condensation at a single valley.By tuning the temperature, we observe a vestigial order melting of the chiral superfluid: first into a paramagnetic superfluid, and then into a normal phase. We measure the superfluid and Ising transition temperatures across a range of driving frequencies, and find that the critical temperature of the superfluid transition is always higher than that of Ising transition within the studied frequency range. As the frequency approaches the resonance, the Ising transition temperature decreases, while the superfluid transition temperature remains almost unaffected. The two phase transitions merge into a single transition at far detuning. Our experimental results imply rich quantum many-body physics as an interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in periodically driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quench spectroscopy for Lieb-Liniger bosons in the presence of harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quench spectroscopy has emerged as a novel and powerful technique for probing the energy spectrum of various quantum phases for quantum systems from out-of-equilibrium dynamics. While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-only dynamics of the multi-species nonreciprocal Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hepp-Lieb-Dicke model is ubiquitous in cavity quantum electrodynamics, describing spin-cavity coupling which does not conserve excitation number. Coupling the closed spin-cavity system to an environment realizes the open Dicke model, and by tuning the structure of the environment or the system-environment coupling, interesting spin-only models can be engineered. In this work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which realizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and, consequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we improve upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master equation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system. We assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic elimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are sensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we clarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase in the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of phase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point. Lastly, we go beyond mean-field theory by exact numerical diagonalization of the master equation, appealing to permutation symmetry in order to increase the size of accessible systems. We find signatures of phase transitions even for small system sizes.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transitions in monitored gaussian fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum systems, where unitary dynamics compete with continuous measurements, exhibit dynamical transitions as the measurement rate is varied. These reflect abrupt changes in the structure of the evolving wavefunction, captured by complementary complexity diagnostics that include and go beyond entanglement aspects. Here, we investigate how monitoring affects magic state resources, the nonstabilizerness, of Gaussian fermionic systems. Using scalable Majorana sampling techniques, we track the evolution of stabilizer R\'enyi entropies in large systems under projective measurements. While the leading extensive (volume-law) scaling of magic remains robust across all measurement rates, we uncover a sharp transition in the subleading logarithmic corrections. This measurement-induced complexity transition, invisible to standard entanglement probes, highlights the power of magic-based diagnostics in revealing hidden features of monitored many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for energy eigenstates of SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics, to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Framework for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) enable information processing beyond classical limits by exploiting the advantages of classical and quantum optics. However, simulation of large-scale bosonic lattices remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space required to describe a quantum network accurately. Consequently, previous theoretical studies have been limited to small-scale systems, leaving the behaviour of multimode QONNs largely unexplored. This work presents an efficient computational framework based on the phase-space positive-P method for simulating bosonic neuromorphic systems. This approach provides a view to previously inaccessible regimes, allowing the validation of large-scale bosonic networks in various quantum machine learning tasks such as quantum state classification and quantum state feature prediction. Our results show that the performance of a large quantum reservoir does not improve monotonously with the number of bosonic modes, instead following a complex dependence driven by the interplay of nonlinearity, reservoir size, and the average occupation of the input mode. These findings are essential for designing and optimising optical bosonic reservoirs for future quantum neuromorphic computing devices.</description>

      <title>Shaping Magnetic Order by Local Frustration for Itinerant Fermions on a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic magnetism is an iconic and rare example of collective quantum order that emerges from the interference of paths taken by a hole in a sea of strongly interacting fermions. Here the lattice topology plays a fundamental role, with odd loops frustrating ferromagnetism, as seen in recent experiments. However, the resulting magnetic order on a general graph has remained elusive. Here we systematically establish, using exact diagonalization, that local frustration centers on a grid strongly bind singlets while sharing a delocalized hole. This collective effect generalizes to random graphs, producing sharp and predictable variation with tunable frustration measures. Our findings demonstrate that one can shape the spin order as well as tune the net magnetization by embedding geometric frustration, opening up new avenues for spatially resolved quantum control of many-body systems. We outline a protocol to realize some of the key findings in existing cold-atom setups.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect and self-trapping in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider matter-wave bright solitons in helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices with a view to study Josephson-type oscillation and self-trapping of population imbalance between two pseudo-spin states. For fixed values of nonlinear interaction and lattice parameters, the population imbalance executes Josephson-type oscillation and the frequency of oscillation decreases with the increase of helicoidal gauge potential. The frequency of oscillation, however, increases in presence of nonlinear optical lattices. We find that the population imbalance can oscillate about a non-zero value and result self-trapping for proper choices of parameters of the system. The self-trapping can be enhanced by the increase of helicoidal gauge potential and by properly tuning the lattice parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enriching condensed-matter systems with quantum optical phenomena currently drives intense research efforts, particularly to introduce collective quantum correlations. Here we access this paradigm, by confining dipolar excitons in a nanoscopic lattice where long-range tunneling, and nearest-neighbour dipolar repulsions, dress the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Long-range tunneling is evidenced by the spontaneous buildup of many-body sub-radiance, signalled by an algebraic slowdown of excitons radiative dissipation. In addition, we observe a threshold increase of temporal coherence for dipolar quantum solids only. It suggests that excitons condense in a single sub-radiant state for Mott-like phases. These combine then spatial order and extended phase coherence, in a single degree of freedom. Our sudy unveils that nanoscopic exciton arrays provide a unique platform to design new frontiers of strongly-correlated lattice models with long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fermi acceleration with cold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.</description>
