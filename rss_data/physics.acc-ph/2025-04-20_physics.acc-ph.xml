      <title>GeV-level $\gamma$-ray and positron beams produced by collisions of ultra-intense ultra-short laser on high-energy electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on collisions between the 100 PW laser and 8 GeV superconducting linear accelerator constructing at the Shanghai hard X-ray free electron laser system (SHINE), the building of GeV-level $\gamma$-ray as well as positron beams are proposed according to particle-in-cell simulations. Key processes are considered involving the nonlinear inverse Compton scattering for $\gamma$-ray generation and the multiphoton Breit-Wheeler process for electron-positron pair production. Regardless of laser polarization, the simulations indicate that $\gamma$-ray beams achieve energy up to 8 GeV, brilliance around 10$^{27}$ photons/(s mm$^{2}$ mrad$^{2}$), and emittance as low as 0.1 mm mrad, while positron beams reach energy up to 7 GeV, brilliance around 4 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ positrons/(s mm$^{2}$ mrad$^{2}$), and emittance as low as 0.1 mm mrad. Various applications could benefit from the possible high-energy $\gamma$-ray and positron beams built at the SHINE facility, including fundamental physics of strong-field quantum electrodynamics theory validation, nuclear physics, radiopharmaceutical preparation, and imaging, etc.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Focusing Mechanism of the NuMI Horn Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) is a project at Fermilab that provides an intense beam of neutrinos used by a number of experiments. NuMI creates a beam of pions that decay into neutrinos, muons, and other particles. Muons are registered by the muon monitors. Magnetic horns are the key elements of the NuMI beam line. This paper uses the muon beam profile observed at the muon monitors to study the NuMI horn focusing mechanism. It is found that the horn magnet generates dipole and quadrupole fields to focus pions. This suggests that the optics of the horn magnet are predominantly linear. Our study shows that the muon beam profile accurately detects the horn current within 0.05%.</description>

      <title>Lessons from commissioning of the cryogenic system for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Results from commissioning and first year of operations of the cryogenic system of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector (SBND) and its membrane cryostat installed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory are described. The SBND detector is installed in a 200 m$^3$ membrane cryostat filled with liquid argon, which serves both as target and as active media. For the correct operation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal conditions while the contamination of electronegative impurities must be consistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The detector is operated in Booster Neutrino Beams (BNB) at Fermilab for the search of sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections. The cryostat and the cryogenic systems also serve as prototypes for the much larger equipment to be used for the LBNF/DUNE experiment. Since its installation in 2018-2023 and cooldown in spring of 2024, the cryostat and the cryogenic system have been commissioned to support the detector operations. The lessons learned through installation, testing, commissioning, cooldown, and initial operations are described.</description>
