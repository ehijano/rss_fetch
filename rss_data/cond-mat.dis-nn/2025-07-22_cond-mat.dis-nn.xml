      <title>Siamese Neural Network for Label-Efficient Critical Phenomena Prediction in 3D Percolation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Percolation theory serves as a cornerstone for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena, with broad implications in statistical physics, materials science, and complex networks. However, most machine learning frameworks for percolation analysis have focused on two-dimensional systems, oversimplifying the spatial correlations and morphological complexity of real-world three-dimensional materials. To bridge this gap and improve label efficiency and scalability in 3D systems, we propose a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that leverages features of the largest cluster as discriminative input. Our method achieves high predictive accuracy for both site and bond percolation thresholds and critical exponents in three dimensions, with sub-1% error margins using significantly fewer labeled samples than traditional approaches. This work establishes a robust and data-efficient framework for modeling high-dimensional critical phenomena, with potential applications in materials discovery and complex network analysis.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagation, giving rise to a range of peculiar wave phenomena. In this work, we investigate Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices. Focusing on the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model, we uncover anisotropic hybrid modes (HMs) that exhibit skin localization along one direction and Anderson localization along the other. We determine the Anderson transition along different directions via the transfer matrix approach and finite-size scaling of Lyapunov exponents. This allows us to map out mobility edges that separate HMs from normal skin modes and Anderson localized modes (ALMs), revealing an ALM-HM-ALM reentrant transition. Our analysis extends to arbitrary dimensions, and we demonstrate the existence of skin-Anderson transitions on the infinite-dimensional nonreciprocal Bethe lattice using the forward-scattering approximation.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics with Topological Origins for non-Hermitian Scattering Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex singularities and their speckle patterns in random superpositions of waves are an inevitable consequence of destructive interference and are consequently generic and ubiquitous. Singularities are topologically stable, they persist under small perturbations and can only be removed via pairwise annihilation. They have found application in optical, acoustic, elastic, and fluid wave fields, among others. We generalize the concept of singularity speckle patterns to arbitrary two dimensional parameter spaces and any complex scalar function that describes wave phenomena involving complicated scattering. In scattering systems specifically, we are often concerned with singularities associated with complex zeros of the scattering matrix S. Some examples are Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA), Reflectionless Scattering Modes (RSMs), Transmissionless Scattering Modes (TSMs), and S-matrix Exceptional Points (EPs). All scattering singularities empirically share a universal statistical property: the tail of the probability distribution function of a quantity that diverges only at a singularity has the form of a -3 power law. The heavy tail of the distribution provides an estimate for the likelihood of finding a given singularity in a generic scattering system. We use these universal statistical results to determine that homogeneous system loss is the most important parameter determining singularity density in a given parameter space. Finally, we discuss events where distinct singularities coincide in parameter space, which result in higher order singularities that have new applications. These higher order singularities are not topologically protected, and we do not find universal statistical properties for them. We support our empirical results from microwave experiments with Random Matrix Theory simulations and conclude that all results presented are found in all generic scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Power Factor Enhancement and Local Structural Transition in Ni-Doped TiCoSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a significant enhancement (~269%) in the power factor (PF) and a local structural transition in Ni-doped TiCoSb samples (TiCo_{1-x}Ni_xSb, (x= 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06). First-principles calculations reveal that even minute Ni doping induces a substantial shift in the Fermi level (EF) and alters the density of states (DOS). Structural analysis via Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shows anomalous behavior at x = 0.02, supported by Williamson-Hall and modified methods. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ti and Co K-edges further confirms a pronounced local structural change at this composition. These structural transitions are consistent with temperature-dependent resistivity (\rho(T)) and thermopower (S(T)) data, which reflect changes in EF and disorder. Analysis of Lorentz number and scattering parameters reinforces the observed modifications in the electronic structure. The simultaneous enhancement of S and electrical conductivity at x = 0.02 is attributed to the disorder-to-order transition, leading to the marked rise in PF.</description>

      <title>When quenched and annealed pinning transitions coincide? A directed walk near a corrugated wall in disorders of various types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a discrete half-line $m \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) located at $m=0$, with distribution $Q(u_j)$. By computing the first two moments, $\la G_N \ra$ and $\la G_N^2 \ra$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over the disorder, we show that the pinning transition for $\la G_N^2 \ra$ may or may not coincide with that of $\la G_N \ra$, depending on the details of the disorder distribution $Q(u_j)$. This result reconciles opposite viewpoints on whether the pinning transition points in models with annealed and quenched disorder coincide or not.</description>

      <title>On zeros and algorithms for disordered systems: mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for nearly all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for almost the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Data augmentation enables label-specific generation of homologous protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately annotating and controlling protein function from sequence data remains a major challenge, particularly within homologous families where annotated sequences are scarce and structural variation is minimal. We present a two-stage approach for semi-supervised functional annotation and conditional sequence generation in protein families using representation learning. First, we demonstrate that protein language models, pretrained on large and diverse sequence datasets and possibly finetuned via contrastive learning, provide embeddings that robustly capture fine-grained functional specificities, even with limited labeled data. Second, we use the inferred annotations to train a generative probabilistic model, an annotation-aware Restricted Boltzmann Machine, capable of producing synthetic sequences with prescribed functional labels. Across several protein families, we show that this approach achieves highly accurate annotation quality and supports the generation of functionally coherent sequences. Our findings underscore the power of combining self-supervised learning with light supervision to overcome data scarcity in protein function prediction and design.</description>

      <title>How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Establishment of a compensation rule between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Almond - West Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We prove that in strongly disordered, interacting, quantum chains, the conductance of a chain of length $L$ vanishes faster than $1/L$. This means that transport is anomalous in such chains. This phenomenon was first claimed in \cite{Basko2006,gornyi2005interacting} and a pioneering treatment appeared in \cite{Imbrie2016a}</description>

      <title>Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of grokking -- delayed generalization accompanied by non-monotonic test loss behavior -- in a simple binary logistic classification task, for which "memorizing" and "generalizing" solutions can be strictly defined. Surprisingly, we find that grokking arises naturally even in this minimal model when the parameters of the problem are close to a critical point, and provide both empirical and analytical insights into its mechanism. Concretely, by appealing to the implicit bias of gradient descent, we show that logistic regression can exhibit grokking when the training dataset is nearly linearly separable from the origin and there is strong noise in the perpendicular directions. The underlying reason is that near the critical point, "flat" directions in the loss landscape with nearly zero gradient cause training dynamics to linger for arbitrarily long times near quasi-stable solutions before eventually reaching the global minimum. Finally, we highlight similarities between our findings and the recent literature, strengthening the conjecture that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Space Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops when a single particle occupies every vertex. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $ d$-dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>
