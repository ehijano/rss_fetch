      <title>A conditional latent autoregressive recurrent model for generation and forecasting of beam dynamics in particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle accelerators are complex systems that focus, guide, and accelerate intense charged particle beams to high energy. Beam diagnostics present a challenging problem due to limited non-destructive measurements, computationally demanding simulations, and inherent uncertainties in the system. We propose a two-step unsupervised deep learning framework named as Conditional Latent Autoregressive Recurrent Model (CLARM) for learning the spatiotemporal dynamics of charged particles in accelerators. CLARM consists of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) transforming six-dimensional phase space into a lower-dimensional latent distribution and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network capturing temporal dynamics in an autoregressive manner. The CLARM can generate projections at various accelerator modules by sampling and decoding the latent space representation. The model also forecasts future states (downstream locations) of charged particles from past states (upstream locations). The results demonstrate that the generative and forecasting ability of the proposed approach is promising when tested against a variety of evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Superpower E-Beam Sources and Performance Estimates for Compact THz FELs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High peak and average power free-electron lasers (FELs) in the terahertz region (THz) require small diameter, low-emittance, and high voltage electron beams. This paper presents two 1.5-2 MV, 100-200 A, thermionic cathode electron source approaches for compact megawatt range peak power, multi-kilowatt average power, high repetition rate, THz FELs. The preferred beam generation system includes grading electrodes and is quite compact compared to the other standard diode gun approaches. Both provide highly compressed beams at the waist having low values of normalized rms emittance. In particular, the new injector approach with grading electrodes, operating at a body voltage of 1.5-2 MV and 100 A, has a normalized rms emittance of roughly 10 mm-mrad at the beam waist. Power supply switching considerations are considered in the paper as well as considerations for very high-voltage multi-stage depressed collectors for device efficiency enhancement. Based on these designs, we provide performance estimates for FELs operating in the THz spectral region.</description>

      <title>Dynamic motion trajectory control with nanoradian accuracy for multi-element X-ray optical systems via laser interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decades have witnessed the development of new X-ray beam sources with brightness growing at a rate surpassing Moore's law. Current and upcoming diffraction limited and fully coherent X-ray beam sources, including multi-bend achromat based synchrotron sources and high repetition rate X-ray free electron lasers, puts increasingly stringent requirements on stability and accuracy of X-ray optics systems. Parasitic motion errors at sub-micro radian scale in beam transport and beam conditioning optics can lead to significant loss of coherence and brightness delivered from source to experiment. To address this challenge, we incorporated optical metrology based on interferometry and differential wavefront sensing as part of the X-ray optics motion control system. A prototype X-ray optics system was constructed following the optical layout of a tunable X-ray cavity. On-line interferometric metrology enabled dynamical feedback to a motion control system to track and compensate for motion errors. The system achieved sub-microradian scale performance, as multiple optical elements are synchronously and continuously adjusted. This first proof of principle measurement demonstrated both the potential and necessity of incorporating optical metrology as part of the motion control architecture for large scale X-ray optical systems such as monochromators, delay lines, and in particular, X-ray cavity systems to enable the next generation cavity-based X-ray free electron lasers.</description>
