      <title>Proxy principles in combinatorial set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameterized proxy principles were introduced by Brodsky and Rinot in a 2017 paper, as new foundations for the construction of $\kappa$-Souslin trees in a uniform way that does not depend on the nature of the (regular uncountable) cardinal $\kappa$. Since their introduction, these principles have facilitated construction of Souslin trees with complex combinations of features, and have enabled the discovery of completely new scenarios in which Souslin trees must exist. Furthermore, the proxy principles have found new applications beyond the construction of trees.
  This paper opens with a comprehensive exposition of the proxy principles. We motivate their very definition, emphasizing the utility of each of the parameters and the consequent flexibility that they provide. We then survey the findings surrounding them, presenting a rich spectrum of unrelated models and configurations in which the proxy principles are known to hold, and showcasing a gallery of Souslin trees constructed from the principles.
  The last two sections of the paper offer new results. In particular, for every positive integer $n$, we give a construction of a $\lambda^+$-Souslin tree all of whose $n$-derived trees are Souslin, but whose $(n+1)$-power is special.</description>

      <title>Splitting differential equations using Galois theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is interested in pullbacks under the logarithmic derivative of algebraic ordinary differential equations. In particular, assuming the solution set of an equation is internal to the constants, we would like to determine when its pullback is itself internal to the constants. To do so, we develop, using model-theoretic Galois theory and differential algebra, a connection between internality of the pullback and the splitting of a short exact sequence of algebraic Galois groups. We then use algebraic group theory to obtain internality and non-internality results.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and model-complete fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study model-complete fields that avoid a given quasi-project variety $V$. There is a close connection between hyperbolicity of $V$ and the existence of the model companion for the theory of characteristic-zero fields without rational points on $V$, extending the results for curves by Will Johnson and Jinhe Ye. In particular, we show that if $V$ is a Brody hyperbolic projective variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $V(\mathbb{Q}) = \varnothing$, then the model companion, called $V\mathrm{XF}$, exists. We also study some model-theoretic properties of $V\mathrm{XF}$.</description>

      <title>Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy.
  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.
  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent.
  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.</description>

      <title>Topoi with enough points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Deligne's original argument showing that locally coherent topoi have enough points, clarified using collage diagrams. We show that our refinement of Deligne's technique can be adapted to recover every existing result of this kind, including the most recent results about $\kappa$-coherent $\kappa$-topoi. Our presentation allows us to relax the cardinality assumptions typically imposed on the sites involved. We show that a larger class of locally finitely presentable toposes have enough points and that a closed subtopos of a topos with enough points has enough points.</description>

      <title>On the Metric Temporal Logic for Continuous Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove measurability of event for which a general continuous-time stochastic process satisfies continuous-time Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) formula. Continuous-time MTL can define temporal constrains for physical system in natural way. Then there are several researches that deal with probability of continuous MTL semantics for stochastic processes. However, proving measurability for such events is by no means an obvious task, even though it is essential. The difficulty comes from the semantics of "until operator", which is defined by logical sum of uncountably many propositions. Given the difficulty involved in proving the measurability of such an event using classical measure-theoretic methods, we employ a theorem from stochastic analysis. This theorem is utilized to prove the measurability of hitting times for stochastic processes, and it stands as a profound result within the theory of capacity. Next, we provide an example that illustrates the failure of probability approximation when discretizing the continuous semantics of MTL formulas with respect to time. Additionally, we prove that the probability of the discretized semantics converges to that of the continuous semantics when we impose restrictions on diamond operators to prevent nesting.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>Surfaces and other Peano Continua with no Generic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The space of chains on a compact connected space encodes all the different ways of continuously growing out of a point until exhausting the space. A chain is generic if its orbit under the action of the underlying homeomorphism group is comeager. In this paper we show that a large family of topological spaces do not have a generic chain: in addition to all manifolds of dimension at least 3, for which the result was already known, our theorem covers all compact surfaces except for the sphere and the real projective plane - for which the question remains open - as well as all other homogeneous Peano continua, circle excluded. If the spaces are moreover strongly locally homogeneous, which is the case for any closed manifold and the Menger curve, we prove that chains cannot be classified up to homeomorphism by countable structures, and that the underlying homomorphism groups have non-metrizable universal minimal flows, in contrast to the case of 1-dimensional manifolds. The proof of the main result is of combinatorial nature, and it relies on the creation of a dictionary between open sets of chains on one side, and walks on finite connected graphs on the other.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>
