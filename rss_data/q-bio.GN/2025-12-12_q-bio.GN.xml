      <title>Development of an Agentic AI Model for NGS Downstream Analysis Targeting Researchers with Limited Biological Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a cornerstone of genomic research, yet the complexity of downstream analysis-ranging from differential expression gene (DEG) identification to biological interpretations-remains a significant barrier for researchers lacking specialized computational and biological expertise. While recent studies have introduced AI agents for RNA-seq analysis, most focus on general workflows without offering tailored interpretations or guidance for novices. To address this gap, we developed an Agentic AI model designed to automate NGS downstream analysis, provide literature-backed interpretations, and autonomously recommend advanced analytical methods. Built on the Llama 3 70B Large Language Model (LLM) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, the model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application. The system integrates standard bioinformatics tools (Biopython, GSEApy, gProfiler) to execute core analyses, including DEG identification, clustering, and pathway enrichment. Uniquely, the agent utilizes RAG to query PubMed via Entrez, synthesizing biological insights and validating hypotheses with current literature. In a case study using cancer-related dataset, the model successfully identified significant DEGs, visualized clinical correlations, and derived evidence-based insights (e.g., linking BRAF mutations to prognosis), subsequently executing advanced survival modeling upon user selection. This framework democratizes bioinformatics by enabling researchers with limited backgrounds to seamlessly transition from basic data processing to advanced hypothesis testing and validation.</description>

      <title>Murmur2Vec: A Hashing Based Solution For Embedding Generation Of COVID-19 Spike Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection and characterization of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, remain critical for effective clinical response and public-health planning. The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\%. This highlights the method's potential as a fast, effective, and scalable solution for large-scale viral sequence analysis.</description>

      <title>Same model, better performance: the impact of shuffling on DNA Language Models benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly popular in genomics due to their potential to decode complex biological sequences. Hence, researchers require a standardized benchmark to evaluate DNA Language Models (DNA LMs) capabilities. However, evaluating DNA LMs is a complex task that intersects genomic's domain-specific challenges and machine learning methodologies, where seemingly minor implementation details can significantly compromise benchmark validity. We demonstrate this through BEND (Benchmarking DNA Language Models), where hardware-dependent hyperparameters -- number of data loading workers and buffer sizes -- create spurious performance variations of up to 4% for identical models. The problem stems from inadequate data shuffling interacting with domain specific data characteristics. Experiments with three DNA language models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2, ResNet-LM) show these artifacts affect both absolute performance and relative model rankings. We propose a simple solution: pre-shuffling data before storage eliminates hardware dependencies while maintaining efficiency. This work highlights how standard ML practices can interact unexpectedly with domain-specific data characteristics, with broader implications for benchmark design in specialized domains.</description>
