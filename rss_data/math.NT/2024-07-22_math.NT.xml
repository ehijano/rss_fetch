      <title>Almost all elliptic curves with prescribed torsion have Szpiro ratio close to the expected value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that almost all elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with prescribed torsion subgroup, when ordered by naive height, have Szpiro ratio arbitrarily close to the expected value. We also provide upper and lower bounds for the Szpiro ratio that hold for almost all elliptic curves in certain one-parameter families. The results are achieved by proving that, given any multivariate polynomial within a general class, the absolute value of the polynomial over an expanding box is typically bounded by a fixed power of its radical. The proof adapts work of Fouvry--Nair--Tenenbaum, which shows that almost all elliptic curves have Szpiro ratio close to $1$.</description>

      <title>Higher a-numbers in $\mathbf{Z}_p$-towers via Counting Lattice Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Booher, Cais, Kramer-Miller and Upton study a class of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-tower of curves in characteristic $p$ with ramification controlled by an integer $d$. In the special case that $d$ divides $p-1$, they prove a formula for the higher $a$-numbers of these curves involving the number of lattice points in a complicated region of the plane. Booher and Cais had previously conjectured that for $n$ sufficiently large the higher $a$-numbers of the $n$th curve are given by formulae of the form $\alpha(n) p^{2n} + \beta(n) p^n + \lambda_r(n) n + \nu(n) $ for $n$ sufficiently large, where $\alpha,\beta,\nu,\lambda_r$ are periodic functions of $n$. This is an example of a new kind of Iwasawa theory. We establish this conjecture by carefully studying these lattice points.</description>

      <title>A slight improvement on the Ball-Rivoal theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear span of $1,\zeta(3),\zeta(5),\ldots,\zeta(s-1)$ is at least $1.009 \cdot \log s/(1+\log 2)$ for any sufficiently large even integer $s$ and we claim that the constant $1.009$ can be improved further to $1.108$. This slightly refines a well-known result of Rivoal (2000) or Ball-Rivoal (2001). Quite unexpectedly, the proof only involves inserting the arithmetic observation of Zudilin (2001) into the original proof of Ball-Rivoal. Although our result is covered by a recent development of Fischler (2021+), our proof has the advantages of being simple and providing explicit non-vanishing small linear forms in $1$ and odd zeta values.</description>

      <title>Galois representations are surjective for almost all Drinfeld modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article advances the results of Duke on the average surjectivity of Galois representations for elliptic curves to the context of Drinfeld modules over function fields. Let $F$ be the rational function field over a finite field. I establish that for Drinfeld modules of rank $r \geq 2$, the $T$-adic Galois representation: $\widehat{\rho}_{\phi, T}: Gal(F^{sep}/F) \rightarrow GL_r(\mathbb{F}_q[[T]])$ is surjective for a density $1$ set of such modules. The proof utilizes Hilbert irreducibility (over function fields), Drinfeld's uniformization theory and sieve methods.</description>

      <title>Minimal torsion curves in geometric isogeny classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the study of minimal torsion curves within a fixed geometric isogeny class. For a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-isogeny class $\mathcal{E}$ of elliptic curves and $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, we wish to determine the least degree of a point on the modular curve $X_1(N)$ associated to any $E \in \mathcal{E}$. In the present work, we consider the cases where $\mathcal{E}$ is rational, i.e., contains an elliptic curve with rational $j$-invariant, or where $\mathcal{E}$ consists of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM). If $N=\ell^k$ is a power of a single prime, we give a complete characterization upon restricting to points of odd degree, and also in the case where $\mathcal{E}$ is CM. We include various partial results in the more general setting.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution of abelian number fields with frobenian conditions imposed on the conductor. In particular we find an asymptotic for the number of abelian field extensions of a number field k whose conductor is the sum of two squares. We also discuss an application of the Brauer group of stacks to quadratic number fields.</description>

      <title>On the theory of prime producing sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the foundations of a general framework for producing optimal upper and lower bounds on the sum $\sum_p a_p$ over primes $p$, where $(a_n)_{x/2&lt;n\le x}$ is an arbitrary non-negative sequence satisfying Type I and Type II estimates.
  Our lower bounds on $\sum_p a_p$ depend on a new sieve method, which is non-iterative and uses all of the Type I and Type II information at once. We also give a complementary general procedure for constructing sequences $(a_n)$ satisfying the Type I and Type II estimates, which in many cases proves that our lower bounds on $\sum_p a_p$ are best possible. A key role in both the sieve method and the construction method is played by the geometry of special subsets of $\mathbb{R}^k$.
  This allows us to determine precisely the ranges of Type I and Type II estimates for which an asymptotic for $\sum_p a_p$ is guaranteed, that a substantial Type II range is always necessary to guarantee a non-trivial lower bound for $\sum_p a_p$, and to determine the optimal bounds in some naturally occurring families of parameters from the literature. We also demonstrate that the optimal upper and lower bounds for $\sum_p a_p$ exhibit many discontinuities with respect to the Type I and Type II ranges, ruling out the possibility of a particularly simple characterization.</description>

      <title>Coincidences of Division Fields of an elliptic curve defined over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the absolute Galois group acts on the group of torsion points of the elliptic curve, giving rise to a Galois representation in $\GL(\hat{\Z})$. The obstructions to the surjectivity of this representation are either local (\emph{i.e.} at a prime), or due to nonsurjectivity on the product of local Galois images. In this article, we study an extreme case: the coincidence \emph{i.e.} the equality of $n$-division fields, generated by the $n$-torsion points, attached to different positive integers~$n$. We give necessary conditions for coincidences, dealing separately with vertical coincidences, at a given prime, and horizontal coincidences, across multiple primes, in particular when the Galois group on the $n$-torsion contains the special linear group. We also give a non-trivial construction for coincidences not occurring over $\Q$.</description>

      <title>Generalized class group actions on oriented elliptic curves with level structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a large family of generalized class groups of imaginary quadratic orders $O$ and prove that they act freely and (essentially) transitively on the set of primitively $O$-oriented elliptic curves over a field $k$ (assuming this set is non-empty) equipped with appropriate level structure. This extends, in several ways, a recent observation due to Galbraith, Perrin and Voloch for the ray class group. We show that this leads to a reinterpretation of the action of the class group of a suborder $O' \subseteq O$ on the set of $O'$-oriented elliptic curves, discuss several other examples, and briefly comment on the hardness of the corresponding vectorization problems.</description>

      <title>Commuting graphs of $p$-adic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the commuting graph of $n\times n$ matrices over the field of $p$-adics $\mathbb{Q}_p$, whose vertices are non-scalar $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and whose edges connect pairs of matrices that commute under matrix multiplication. We prove that this graph is connected if and only if $n\geq 3$, with $n$ neither prime nor a power of $p$. We also prove that in the case of $p=2$ and $n=2q$ for $q$ a prime with $q\geq 7$, the commuting graph has the maximum possible diameter of $6$; these are the first known such examples independent of the axiom of choice. We also find choices of $p$ and $n$ yielding diameter $4$ and diameter $5$ commuting graphs, and prove general bounds depending on $p$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of the Bruhat-Tits strata in the supersingular locus of the $\mathrm{GU}(1,n-1)$ Shimura variety at a ramified prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersingular locus of the $\mathrm{GU}(1,n-1)$ Shimura variety at a ramified prime $p$ is stratified by Coxeter varieties attached to finite symplectic groups. In this paper, we compute the $\ell$-adic cohomology of the Zariski closure of any such stratum. These are known as closed Bruhat-Tits strata. We prove that the cohomology groups of odd degree vanish, and those of even degree are explicitely determined as representations of the symplectic group with a Frobenius action. Each closed Bruhat-Tits stratum is linearly stratified by Coxeter varieties attached to smaller symplectic groups. Thanks to results of Lusztig who computed the cohomology of Coxeter varieties for classical groups, we make use of the spectral sequence associated to this stratification and describe explicitely all the terms at infinity. We point out that the closed Bruhat-Tits strata have isolated singularities when the dimension is greater than 1. Our analysis requires discussing the smoothness of the blow-up at the singular points, as well as comparing the ordinary $\ell$-adic cohomology with intersection cohomology. A by-product of our computations is that these two cohomologies actually coincide, so that surprisingly the presence of singularities does not interfere with the cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sen's theorem on the ramification of a $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic local fields shows that its perfectoidness is equivalent to the non-vanishing of its arithmetic Sen operator. By developing $p$-adic Hodge theory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen's criterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its (Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing of the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application, we prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher degrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cohomology of the unitary unramified PEL Rapoport-Zink space of signature $(1,n-1)$ at maximal level. Our method revolves around the spectral sequence associated to the open cover by the analytical tubes of the closed Bruhat-Tits strata in the special fiber, which were constructed by Vollaard and Wedhorn. The cohomology of these strata, which are isomorphic to generalized Deligne-Lusztig varieties, has been computed in a previous paper. This spectral sequence allows us to prove the semisimplicity of the Frobenius action and the non-admissibility of the cohomology in general. Via $p$-adic uniformization, we relate the cohomology of the Rapoport-Zink space to the cohomology of the supersingular locus of a Shimura variety with no level at $p$. In the case $n=3$ or $4$, we give a complete description of the cohomology of the supersingular locus in terms of automorphic representations.</description>

      <title>On Finite Fields and Higher Reciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cubic and biquadratic reciprocity have long since been referred to as "the forgotten reciprocity laws", largely since they provide special conditions that are widely considered to be unnecessary in the study of number theory. In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}^{*}$. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$, and further investigations into the residue class ring $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]/\pi\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ for $\pi$ prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We then define the general multiplicative character and state the full law of cubic reciprocity. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime $2$ and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for $2$ to be a cubic residue. We conclude with a brief survey of the law of biquadratic reciprocity.</description>

      <title>A nonabelian circle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We count integral quaternion zeros of $\gamma_1^2 \pm \dots \pm \gamma_n^2$, giving an asymptotic when $n\ge 9$, and a likely near-optimal bound when $n=8$. To do so, we introduce a new, nonabelian delta symbol method, which is of independent interest. Our asymptotic at height $X$ takes the form $cX^{4n-8} + O(X^{3n+\varepsilon})$ for suitable $c \in \mathbb{C}$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0.$ We construct special subvarieties implying that, in general, $3n+\varepsilon$ can be at best improved to $3n-2.$</description>

      <title>Moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda_X(s)=\det(I-sX^{\dagger})$ be the characteristic polynomial of the unitary matrix $X$. It is believed that the distribution of values of $\Lambda_X(s)$ model the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. This principle motivates many avenues of study. Of particular interest is the behavior of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros (all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present several identities for the moments of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for $x \in \mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|x|=1$. Additionally, we prove, for positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k} dX$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} dX$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio, $f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$ is prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a second order non-linear Painl\'{e}ve differential equation. Finally we give some formulas in terms of the $_3F_2$ hypergeometric series for the moments in the simplest case when $N=2$, and also study the radial distribution of the zeros of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ in that case.</description>
