      <title>Detection of Signals in Colored Noise: Roy's Largest Root Test for Non-central $F$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the signal detection problem in colored noise with an unknown covariance matrix. In particular, we focus on detecting a non-random signal by capitalizing on the leading eigenvalue (a.k.a. Roy's largest root) of the whitened sample covariance matrix as the test statistic. To this end, the whitened sample covariance matrix is constructed via \(m\)-dimensional \(p \) plausible signal-bearing samples and \(m\)-dimensional \(n \) noise-only samples. Since the signal is non-random, the whitened sample covariance matrix turns out to have a {\it non-central} \(F\)-distribution with a rank-one non-centrality parameter. Therefore, the performance of the test entails the statistical characterization of the leading eigenvalue of the non-central \(F\)-matrix, which we address by deriving its cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) in closed-form by leveraging the powerful orthogonal polynomial approach in random matrix theory. This new c.d.f. has been instrumental in analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the detector. We also extend our analysis into the high dimensional regime in which \(m,n\), and \(p\) diverge such that \(m/n\) and \(m/p\) remain fixed. It turns out that, when \(m=n\) and fixed, the power of the test improves if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is of at least \(O(p)\), whereas the corresponding SNR in the high dimensional regime is of at least \(O(p^2)\). Nevertheless, more intriguingly, for \(m&lt;n\) with the SNR of order \(O(p)\), the leading eigenvalue does not have power to detect {\it weak} signals in the high dimensional regime.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Based Deep Learning for Time-Efficient Inverse Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate understanding of muscle activation and muscle forces plays an essential role in neuro-rehabilitation and musculoskeletal disorder treatments. Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of an IoT-based Respiratory Motion Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades, several wearable devices have been designed to monitor respiration rate in an effort to capture pulmonary signals with higher accuracy and reduce patients' discomfort during use. In this article, we present the design and implementation of a device for real-time monitoring of respiratory system movements. When breathing, the circumference of the abdomen and thorax changes; therefore, we used a Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) attached to the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to measure this variation as the patient inhales and exhales. The mechanical strain this causes changes the FSR electrical resistance accordingly. Also, for streaming this variable resistance on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5 is utilized due to the adequate throughput, high accessibility, and possibility of power consumption reduction. Furthermore, this device presents features such as low power consumption (0.4 mW), high precision, and ease of use.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based mmWave MIMO Beam Tracking in V2I Scenarios: Algorithms and Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of machine learning applied to the beam tracking problem in 5G networks and beyond. The goal is to decrease the overhead associated to MIMO millimeter wave beamforming. In comparison to beam selection (also called initial beam acquisition), ML-based beam tracking is less investigated in the literature due to factors such as the lack of comprehensive datasets. One of the contributions of this work is a new public multimodal dataset, which includes images, LIDAR information and GNSS positioning, enabling the evaluation of new data fusion algorithms applied to wireless communications. The work also contributes with an evaluation of the performance of beam tracking algorithms, and associated methodology. When considering as inputs the LIDAR data, the coordinates and the information from previously selected beams, the proposed deep neural network based on ResNet and using LSTM layers, significantly outperformed the other beam tracking models.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communications and Sensing: Their Models and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting a great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over the conventional RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill the gap, we introduce the superheterodyne version of RAQRs to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to a half-wavelength dipole antenna based conventional RF receiver. The results show that the RAQR is capable of achieving a substantial receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of $\sim 22.6$ decibel (dB) and $\sim 33.5$ dB in the standard (unoptimized) and optimized configurations, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Dataset Similarity Evaluation Framework for Wireless Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a task-specific, model-agnostic framework for evaluating dataset similarity, providing a means to assess and compare dataset realism and quality. Such a framework is crucial for augmenting real-world data, improving benchmarking, and making informed retraining decisions when adapting to new deployment settings, such as different sites or frequency bands. The proposed framework is employed to design metrics based on UMAP topology-preserving dimensionality reduction, leveraging Wasserstein and Euclidean distances on latent space KNN clusters. The designed metrics show correlations above 0.85 between dataset distances and model performances on a channel state information compression unsupervised machine learning task leveraging autoencoder architectures. The results show that the designed metrics outperform traditional methods.</description>

      <title>DM-SBL: Channel Estimation under Structured Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation is a fundamental task in communication systems and is critical for effective demodulation. While most works deal with a simple scenario where the measurements are corrupted by the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), this work addresses the more challenging scenario where both AWGN and structured interference coexist. Such conditions arise, for example, when a sonar/radar transmitter and a communication receiver operate simultaneously within the same bandwidth. To ensure accurate channel estimation in these scenarios, the sparsity of the channel in the delay domain and the complicate structure of the interference are jointly exploited. Firstly, the score of the structured interference is learned via a neural network based on the diffusion model (DM), while the channel prior is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, with its variance controlling channel sparsity, similar to the setup of the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). Then, two efficient posterior sampling methods are proposed to jointly estimate the sparse channel and the interference. Nuisance parameters, such as the variance of the prior are estimated via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is termed as DM based SBL (DM-SBL). Numerical simulations demonstrate that DM-SBL significantly outperforms conventional approaches that deal with the AWGN scenario, particularly under low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) conditions. Beyond channel estimation, DM-SBL also shows promise for addressing other linear inverse problems involving structured interference.</description>

      <title>Efficient Joint Precoding Design for Wideband Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Cell-Free Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient joint precoding design method to maximize the weighted sum-rate in wideband intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted cell-free networks by jointly optimizing the active beamforming of base stations and the passive beamforming of IRS. Due to employing wideband transmissions, the frequency selectivity of IRSs has to been taken into account, whose response usually follows a Lorentzian-like profile. To address the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, we employ a fractional programming approach to decouple the non-convex problem into subproblems for alternating optimization between active and passive beamforming. The active beamforming subproblem is addressed using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, while the passive beamforming subproblem is tackled using the accelerated projection gradient (APG) method and Flecher-Reeves conjugate gradient method (FRCG). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves significant improvements in weighted sum-rate under various performance metrics compared to primal-dual subgradient (PDS) with ideal reflection matrix. This study provides valuable insights for computational complexity reduction and network capacity enhancement.</description>

      <title>Sensor Selection and Distributed Quantization for Energy Efficiency in Massive MTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an estimation approach within the framework of uplink massive machine-type communications (mMTC) that considers the energy limitations of the devices. We focus on a scenario where a group of sensors observe a set of parameters and send the measured information to a collector node (CN). The CN is responsible for estimating the original observations, which are spatially correlated and corrupted by measurement and quantization noise. Given the use of Gaussian sources, the minimum mean squared error (MSE) estimation is employed and, when considering temporal evolution, the use of Kalman filters is studied. Based on that, we propose a device selection strategy to reduce the number of active sensors and a quantization scheme with adjustable number of bits to minimize the overall payload. The set of selected sensors and quantization levels are, thus, designed to minimize the MSE. For a more realistic analysis, communication errors are also included by averaging the MSE over the error decoding probabilities. We evaluate the performance of our strategy in a practical mMTC system with synthetic and real databases. Simulation results show that the optimization of the payload and the set of active devices can reduce the power consumption without compromising the estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Sensing Schemes for Energy Efficiency in Massive MTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-type communications (MTC) are crucial in the evolution of mobile communication systems. Within this context, we distinguish the so-called massive MTC (mMTC), where a large number of devices coexist in the same geographical area. In the case of sensors, a high correlation in the collected information is expected. In this letter, we evaluate the impact of correlation on the entropy of a set of quantized Gaussian sources. This model allows us to express the sensed data with the data correlation matrix. Given the nature of mMTC, these matrices may be well approximated as rank deficient. Accordingly, we exploit this singularity to design a technique for switching off several sensors that maximizes the entropy under power-related constraints. The discrete optimization problem is transformed into a convex formulation that can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Approximations of the Aggregated Interference Statistics for Outage Analysis in Massive MTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents several analytic closed-form approximations of the aggregated interference statistics within the framework of uplink massive machine-type communications (mMTC), taking into account the random activity of the sensors. Given its discrete nature and the large number of devices involved, a continuous approximation based on the Gram--Charlier series expansion of a truncated Gaussian kernel is proposed. We use this approximation to derive an analytic closed-form expression for the outage probability, corresponding to the event of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio being below a detection threshold. This metric is useful since it can be used for evaluating the performance of mMTC systems. We analyze, as an illustrative application of the previous approximation, a scenario with several multi-antenna collector nodes, each equipped with a set of predefined spatial beams. We consider two setups, namely single- and multiple-resource, in reference to the number of resources that are allocated to each beam. A graph-based approach that minimizes the average outage probability, and that is based on the statistics approximation, is used as allocation strategy. Finally, we describe an access protocol where the resource identifiers are broadcast (distributed) through the beams. Numerical simulations prove the accuracy of the approximations and the benefits of the allocation strategy.</description>

      <title>The Field-based Model: A New Perspective on RF-based Material Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the design and implementation of WiField, a WiFi sensing system deployed on COTS devices that can simultaneously identify multiple wavelength-level targets placed flexibly. Unlike traditional RF sensing schemes that focus on specific targets and RF links, WiField focuses on all media in the sensing area for the entire electric field. In this perspective, WiField provides a unified framework to finely characterize the diffraction, scattering, and other effects of targets at different positions, materials, and numbers on signals. The combination of targets in different positions, numbers, and sizes is just a special case. WiField proposed a scheme that utilizes phaseless data to complete the inverse mapping from electric field to material distribution, thereby achieving the simultaneous identification of multiple wavelength-level targets at any position and having the potential for deployment on a wide range of low-cost COTS devices. Our evaluation results show that it has an average identification accuracy of over 97% for 1-3 targets (5 cm * 10 cm in size) with different materials randomly placed within a 1.05 m * 1.05 m area.</description>

      <title>Enhanced channel estimation for double RIS-aided MIMO systems using coupled tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a double-RIS (D-RIS)-aided flat-fading MIMO system and propose an interference-free channel training and estimation protocol, where the two single-reflection links and the one double-reflection link are estimated separately. Specifically, by using the proposed training protocol, the signal measurements of a particular reflection link can be extracted interference-free from the measurements of the superposition of the three links. We show that some channels are associated with two different components of the received signal. Exploiting the common channels involved in the single and double reflection links while recasting the received signals as tensors, we formulate the coupled tensor-based least square Khatri-Rao factorization (C-KRAFT) algorithm which is a closed-form solution and an enhanced iterative solution with less restrictions on the identifiability constraints, the coupled-alternating least square (C-ALS) algorithm. The C-KRAFT and C-ALS based channel estimation schemes are used to obtain the channel matrices in both single and double reflection links. We show that the proposed coupled tensor decomposition-based channel estimation schemes offer more accurate channel estimates under less restrictive identifiability constraints compared to competing channel estimation methods. Simulation results are provided showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

In this vein, the TLSM indicator and it spectral counterpart known as the multifrequency LSM are formulated within the context of LU testing. The affiliated imaging functionals are then computed using synthetic and experimental data germane to LU inspection of aluminum alloy specimens with manufactured defects. Hyperparameters of inversion are computationally analyzed. We demonstrate using synthetic data that the TLSM indicator has the unique ability to recover weak (or hard-to-reach) scatterers and has the potential to generate higher quality images compared to LSM. Provided high-SNR measurements, this advantage may be preserved in reconstructions from LU test data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 5G-NR mmWave : Phase Noise Models Evaluation with MMSE for CPE Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of 5G New Radio (NR) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems highlights the critical importance of maintaining accurate phase synchronization to ensure reliable and efficient communication. This study focuses on evaluating phase noise models and implementing Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) algorithms for Common Phase Error (CPE) compensation. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that CPE compensation significantly enhances signal quality by reducing Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and Bit Error Rate (BER) across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels and antenna configurations. Results indicate that implementing MMSE-based CPE estimation and compensation in 5G-NR mmWave systems reduced EVM from 7.4\% to 4.6\% for 64QAM and from 5.4\% to 4.3\% for 256QAM, while also decreasing BER from $5.5 \times 10^{-3}$ to $5.2 \times 10^{-5}$ for 64QAM, demonstrating significant improvements in signal quality and reliability across various SNR levels and antenna configurations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing phase noise mitigation strategies in 5G-NR mmWave systems, contributing to the development of more robust and efficient next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for accurate, continuous, and non-invasive health monitoring has propelled multi-sensor data fusion to the forefront of healthcare technology. This review aims to provide an overview of the development of fusion frameworks in the literature and common terminology used in fusion literature. The review introduces the fusion classification standards and methods that are most relevant from an algorithm development perspective. Applications of the reviewed fusion frameworks in fields such as defense, autonomous driving, robotics, and image fusion are also discussed to provide contextual information on the various fusion methodologies that have been developed in this field. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of multi-sensor data fusion methods applied to health monitoring systems, focusing on key algorithms, applications, challenges, and future directions. We examine commonly used fusion techniques, including Kalman filters, Bayesian networks, and machine learning models. By integrating data from various sources, these fusion approaches enhance the reliability, accuracy, and resilience of health monitoring systems. However, challenges such as data quality and differences in acquisition systems exist, calling for intelligent fusion algorithms in recent years. The review finally converges on applications of fusion algorithms in biomedical inference tasks like heartbeat detection, respiration rate estimation, sleep apnea detection, arrhythmia detection, and atrial fibrillation detection.</description>

      <title>EMF-Efficient MU-MIMO Networks: Harnessing Aerial RIS Technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rollout of the fifth-generation (5G) networks has raised some concerns about potential health effects from increased exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). To address these concerns, we design a novel EMF-aware architecture for uplink communications. Specifically, we propose an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) assisted multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where the ARIS features a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panel mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), offering a flexible and adaptive solution for reducing uplink EMF exposure. We formulate and solve a new problem to minimize the EMF exposure by optimizing the system parameters, such as transmit beamforming, resource allocation, transmit power, ARIS phase shifts, and ARIS trajectory. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of EMF-aware transmission scheme over the benchmark methods, achieving EMF reductions of over 30% and 90% compared to the fixed ARIS and non-ARIS schemes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer-based Semantic Communications With Importance-Aware Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications provide significant performance gains over traditional communications by transmitting task-relevant semantic features through wireless channels. However, most existing studies rely on end-to-end (E2E) training of neural-type encoders and decoders to ensure effective transmission of these semantic features. To enable semantic communications without relying on E2E training, this paper presents a vision transformer (ViT)-based semantic communication system with importance-aware quantization (IAQ) for wireless image transmission. The core idea of the presented system is to leverage the attention scores of a pretrained ViT model to quantify the importance levels of image patches. Based on this idea, our IAQ framework assigns different quantization bits to image patches based on their importance levels. This is achieved by formulating a weighted quantization error minimization problem, where the weight is set to be an increasing function of the attention score. Then, an optimal incremental allocation method and a low-complexity water-filling method are devised to solve the formulated problem. Our framework is further extended for realistic digital communication systems by modifying the bit allocation problem and the corresponding allocation methods based on an equivalent binary symmetric channel (BSC) model. Simulations on single-view and multi-view image classification tasks show that our IAQ framework outperforms conventional image compression methods in both error-free and realistic communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>MIMO Detection under Hardware Impairments: Data Augmentation With Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a data detection problem for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with hardware impairments. To facilitate maximum likelihood (ML) data detection without knowledge of nonlinear and unknown hardware impairments, we develop novel likelihood function (LF) estimation methods based on data augmentation and boosting. The core idea of our methods is to generate multiple augmented datasets by injecting noise with various distributions into seed data consisting of online received signals. We then estimate the LF using each augmented dataset based on either the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm or the kernel density estimation (KDE) method. Inspired by boosting, we further refine the estimated LF by linearly combining the multiple LF estimates obtained from the augmented datasets. To determine the weights for this linear combination, we develop three methods that take different approaches to measure the reliability of the estimated LFs. Simulation results demonstrate that both the EM- and KDE-based LF estimation methods offer significant performance gains over existing LF estimation methods. Our results also show that the effectiveness of the proposed methods improves as the size of the augmented data increases.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Holographic Surface-aided Distributed MIMO Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays. The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system performance when hardware resources are fixed.</description>

      <title>A reconfigurable calibration-free digital-to-time converter based on a high-speed transceiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a high-speed transceiver-based method for implementing a digital-to-time converter (DTC). A real-time decoding technique is introduced to inject time information into high-speed pattern data. The stability of the high-speed clock ensures the high precision of the synthesized timing signal without the need for calibration. The reconfigurability of the clock resources provides the DTC with variable resolution and enhanced flexibility for various applications. Based on this approach, a multifunctional DTC is designed to offer both timing sequence and random timing signal functionalities, catering to a wide range of application scenarios. The timing sequence function generates a continuously variable timing signal stream, while the random timing signal function produces random signals with uniformly distributed time intervals. Experimental results, using a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA, validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The system achieves a resolution of 100 ps, a dynamic range from 1 ns to 40 {\mu}s, a DNL of -0.02/0.02 LSB, an INL of -0.04/0.03 LSB across the entire range. This approach can be readily adapted to various high-precision timing signal applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of noise covariance matrix identification of stochastic linear time-varying state-space models is addressed. The measurement difference method (MDM) is generalized to time-varying dimensions of the measurement and control. Three MDM identification techniques that differ in weighting used in the underlying least squares method are proposed. The techniques differ in estimate quality and computational complexity. In addition, recursive forms are designed for two techniques. The performance of the proposed techniques is analyzed using two numerical examples. The implementation of techniques is enclosed with the paper.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the state prediction of nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems. The emphasis is laid on a solution to the integral Chapman-Kolmogorov equation by a deterministic-integration-rule-based point-mass method. A novel concept of reliable data-augmented, i.e., mathematics- and data-informed, integration rule is developed to enhance the point-mass state predictor, where the trained neural network (representing data contribution) is used for the selection of the best integration rule from a set of available rules (representing mathematics contribution). The proposed approach combining the best properties of the standard mathematics-informed and novel data-informed rules is thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work using synchronized, geographically spaced radio telescopes, and a radio interferometer, suggests that narrow-bandwidth polarized pulse pair measurements repeatedly falsify a noise-cause hypothesis, given a prior celestial direction of interest. A four-step method was proposed, tested, and reported, using interferometer phase measurements, to seek common celestial directions among pulse pair components, during 92 days of observation. In the work reported here, the proposed four-step signal discovery method is simplified to have a single step. A 123.8 day interferometer experiment provides measurement evidence supporting a hypothesis that the prior direction of interest, and a second direction of interest, are associated with celestial coordinates. Each pointing direction measures statistical power at greater than six standard deviations, with some indications of associated interferometer-induced Right Ascension aliasing. Explanations are proposed and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a dual-band monopole microstrip patch antenna to operate in the GSM and DCS bands. For compactness the monopole antenna is mounted on top of a FR4 substrate and is designed as a planar structure which can be wrapped into a box like structure. The performance characteristics of the wrapped dual band monopole antenna are simulated on Ansoft HFSS before fabrication and testing on a Network Analyzer. The simulated HFSS return loss of the antenna shows broad agreement with experiment over the frequency range from \(500 ~\mathrm{MHz} \text{ to } 4~\mathrm{GHz}\). Radiation patterns are generated in each band of operation of the antenna. The effect of feedline impedance matching on the performance of the monopole antenna is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Decoupled Channel Estimation Method for Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a new architecture for RIS where elements are interconnected to provide more wave manipulation flexibility than traditional single connected RIS, enhancing data rate and coverage. However, channel estimation for BD-RIS is challenging due to the more complex multiple-connection structure involving their scattering elements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decoupled channel estimation method for BD-RIS that yields separate estimates of the involved channels to enhance the accuracy of the overall combined channel by capitalizing on its Kronecker structure. Starting from a least squares estimate of the combined channel and by properly reshaping the resulting filtered signal, the proposed algorithm resorts to a Khatri-Rao Factorization (KRF) method that teases out the individual channels based on simple rank-one matrix approximation steps. Numerical results show that the proposed decoupled channel estimation yields more accurate channel estimates than the classical least squares scheme.</description>

      <title>A Tensor-Structured Approach to Dynamic Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems with Temporal Non-Stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In moderate- to high-mobility scenarios, channel state information (CSI) varies rapidly and becomes temporally non-stationary, leading to significant performance degradation in channel reciprocity-dependent massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission. To address this challenge, we propose a tensor-structured approach to dynamic channel prediction (TS-DCP) for massive MIMO systems with temporal non-stationarity, leveraging dual-timescale and cross-domain correlations. Specifically, due to the inherent spatial consistency, non-stationary channels on long-timescales are treated as stationary on short-timescales, decoupling complicated correlations into more tractable dual-timescale ones. To exploit such property, we frame the pilot symbols, capturing short-timescale correlations within frames by Doppler domain modeling and long-timescale correlations across frames by Markov/autoregressive processes. Based on this, we develop the tensor-structured signal model in the spatial-frequency-temporal domain, incorporating correlated angle-delay-Doppler domain channels and Vandermonde-structured factor matrices. Furthermore, we model cross-domain correlations within each frame, arising from clustered scatterer distributions, using tensor-structured upgradations of Markov processes and coupled Gaussian distributions. Following these probabilistic models, we formulate the TS-DCP as the variational free energy (VFE) minimization problem, designing trial belief structures through online approximation and the Bethe method. This yields the online TS-DCP algorithm derived from a dual-layer VFE optimization process, where both outer and inner layers leverage the multilinear structure of channels to reduce computational complexity significantly. Numerical simulations demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm over benchmarks in terms of channel prediction performance.</description>

      <title>On Pooling-Based Track Fusion Strategies : Harmonic Mean Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a distributed sensor fusion architecture, using standard Kalman filter (naive fusion) can lead to degraded results as track correlations are ignored and conservative fusion strategies are employed as a sub-optimal alternative to the problem. Since, Gaussian mixtures provide a flexible means of modeling any density, therefore fusion strategies suitable for use with Gaussian mixtures are needed. While the generalized covariance intersection (CI) provides a means to fuse Gaussian mixtures, the procedure is cumbersome and requires evaluating a non-integer power of the mixture density. In this paper, we develop a pooling-based fusion strategy using the harmonic mean density (HMD) interpolation of local densities and show that the proposed method can handle both Gaussian and mixture densities without much changes to the framework. Mathematical properties of the proposed fusion strategy are studied and simulated on 2D and 3D maneuvering target tracking scenarios. The simulations suggest that the proposed HMD fusion performs better than other conservative strategies in terms of root-mean-squared error while being consistent.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Mean Density Fusion in Distributed Tracking: Performance and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed sensor fusion architecture is preferred in a real target-tracking scenario as compared to a centralized scheme since it provides many practical advantages in terms of computation load, communication bandwidth, fault-tolerance, and scalability. In multi-sensor target-tracking literature, such systems are better known by the pseudonym - track fusion, since processed tracks are fused instead of raw measurements. A fundamental problem, however, in such systems is the presence of unknown correlations between the tracks, which renders a standard Kalman filter (naive fusion) useless.
  A widely accepted solution is covariance intersection (CI) which provides near-optimal estimates but at the cost of a conservative covariance. Thus, the estimates are pessimistic, which might result in a delayed error convergence. Also, fusion of Gaussian mixture densities is an active area of research where standard methods of track fusion cannot be used. In this article, harmonic mean density (HMD) based fusion is discussed, which seems to handle both of these issues. We present insights on HMD fusion and prove that the method is a result of minimizing average Pearson divergence. This article also provides an alternative and easy implementation based on an importance-sampling-like method without the requirement of a proposal density. Similarity of HMD with inverse covariance intersection is an interesting find, and has been discussed in detail.
  Results based on a real-world multi-target multi-sensor scenario show that the proposed approach converges quickly than existing track fusion algorithms while also being consistent, as evident from the normalized estimation-error squared (NEES) plots.</description>

Abstract: Multidimensional quaternion arrays (often referred to as "quaternion tensors") and their decompositions have recently gained increasing attention in various fields such as color and polarimetric imaging or video processing. Despite this growing interest, the theoretical development of quaternion tensors remains limited. This paper introduces a novel multilinear framework for quaternion arrays, which extends the classical tensor analysis to multidimensional quaternion data in a rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a new definition of quaternion tensors as $\mathbb{H}\mathbb{R}$-multilinear forms, addressing the challenges posed by the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Within this framework, we establish the Tucker decomposition for quaternion tensors and develop a quaternion Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (Q-CPD). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the Q-CPD, including trivial ambiguities, complex equivalent models, and sufficient conditions for uniqueness. Additionally, we present two algorithms for computing the Q-CPD and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for further research on quaternion tensor decompositions and offer new computational tools for practitioners working with quaternion multiway data.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Digital Twin of the Ocean: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Real-time Wave Height Prediction with Deep Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05475</link>

Abstract: Environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels have prompted the need for eco-friendly power generation methods based on renewable energy. However, renewable energy sources often face challenges in providing stable power due to low energy density and non-stationary. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model, aiming both high predictive accuracy and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ). The proposed architecture LSTM-DE, integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust UQ, achieving accuracy and reliability in wave height prediction. To further enhance the reliability of the predictive models, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Based on the real operational data obtained from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, we demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-DE model architecture achieves notable predictive accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.9) while increasing the uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. The findings show that the proposed method provides robust and reliable real-time wave height predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Allocation for Hybrid Bit and Generative Semantic Communications in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework consisting of hybrid bit-level and generative semantic communications for efficient downlink image transmission within space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). The proposed model comprises multiple low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground users. Considering the limitations in signal coverage and receiver antennas that make the direct communication between satellites and ground users unfeasible in many scenarios, thus UAVs serve as relays and forward images from satellites to the ground users. Our hybrid communication framework effectively combines bit-level transmission with several semantic-level image generation modes, optimizing bandwidth usage to meet stringent satellite link budget constraints and ensure communication reliability and low latency under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To reduce the transmission delay while ensuring the reconstruction quality at the ground user, we propose a novel metric for measuring delay and reconstruction quality in the proposed system, and employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy to optimize the resource in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of communication resource conservation, reduced latency, and maintaining high image quality, significantly outperforming traditional solutions. Therefore, the proposed framework can ensure that real-time image transmission requirements in SAGINs, even under dynamic network conditions and user demand.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Model for Subsurface Well Logs Prediction and Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise in energy demand highlights the importance of suitable subsurface storage, requiring detailed and accurate subsurface characterization often reliant on high-quality borehole well log data. However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin.
  In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%.
  The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding Beamforming and Power Control Designs for Multi-Port Matching Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key technologies of sixth generation (6G), such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), enable intricate interactions between antennas and wireless propagation environments. As a result, it becomes necessary to develop joint models that encompass both antennas and wireless propagation channels. To achieve this, we utilize the multi-port communication theory, which considers impedance matching among the source, transmission medium, and load to facilitate efficient power transfer. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of insertion loss, mutual coupling, and other factors on the performance of multi-port matching networks. Next, to further improve system performance, we explore two important deep unfolding designs for the multi-port matching networks: beamforming and power control, respectively. For the hybrid beamforming, we develop a deep unfolding framework, i.e., projected gradient descent (PGD)-Net based on unfolding projected gradient descent. For the power control, we design a deep unfolding network, graph neural network (GNN) aided alternating optimization (AO)Net, which considers the interaction between different ports in optimizing power allocation. Numerical results verify the necessity of considering insertion loss in the dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) performance analysis. Besides, the proposed PGD-Net based hybrid beamforming approaches approximate the conventional model-based algorithm with very low complexity. Moreover, our proposed power control scheme has a fast run time compared to the traditional weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method.</description>

Abstract: Conventional electromagnetic induction-based current transformers suffer from issues such as bulky and complex structures, slow response times, and low safety levels. Consequently, researchers have explored combining various sensing technologies with optical fibers to develop optical current transformers that could become the primary choice for power systems in the future. With the maturation of optoelectronic technology, optical current transformers have emerged. They offer outstanding advantages, including high sensitivity, integration, stability, and the ability to operate in complex environments. This review categorizes optical current transformers based on different principles, including all-fiber current transformers, those based on magnetostrictive effects, magneto-optic effects, and thermal effects. It also discusses their principles, structures, manufacturing techniques, and signal processing, while forecasting their future development trends.</description>

      <title>A Combined Channel Approach for Decoding Intracranial EEG Signals: Enhancing Accuracy through Spatial Information Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording, characterized by high spatial and temporal resolution and superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enables the development of precise brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for neural decoding. However, the invasive nature of the procedure significantly limits the availability of iEEG datasets in terms of both the number of participants and the duration of recorded sessions. To address this limitation, we propose a single-participant machine learning model optimized for decoding iEEG signals. The model employs 18 key features and operates in two modes: best channel and combined channel. The combined channel mode integrates spatial information from multiple brain regions, leading to superior classification performance. Evaluations across three datasets -- Music Reconstruction, Audio Visual, and AJILE12 -- demonstrate that the combined channel mode consistently outperforms the best channel mode across all classifiers. In the best-performing cases, Random Forest achieved an F1 score of 0.81 +/- 0.05 in the Music Reconstruction dataset and 0.82 +/- 0.10 in the Audio Visual dataset, while XGBoost achieved an F1 score of 0.84 +/- 0.08 in the AJILE12 dataset. Furthermore, the analysis of brain region contributions in the combined channel mode revealed that the model identifies relevant brain regions aligned with physiological expectations for each task and effectively combines data from electrodes in these regions to achieve high performance. These findings highlight the potential of integrating spatial information across brain regions to improve task decoding, offering new avenues for advancing BCI systems and neurotechnological applications.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis and Beamforming Design for 3D Extended Target in ISAC: From Optimization to Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station transmits a common signal for joint multi-user communication and extended target (ET) sensing. We first propose a second-order truncated Fourier series surface model for an arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional ET. Utilizing this model, we derive novel closed-form Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the ET kinematic parameter estimation, such as the center range, azimuth angle, elevation angle, and orientation. Further, we formulate and solve two transmit beamforming design problems with optimization algorithms. The first one, named the CRB minimization problem, minimizes the CRB under constraints of communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement, transmit power, and ET-specific beam coverage requirement, which is solved using the semidefinite relaxation technique. The second one, named the weighted-ISAC-metric problem, targets an weighted objective function combining the communication sum rate and sensing CRB, and is solved using the successive convex approximation technique. Additionally, by exploiting the penalty method, we introduce an unsupervised learning-based approach and propose a unique ISAC graph neural network (ISACGNN), composed of separate communication, sensing, and integration modules, to address both problems. Numerical results reveal the diverse CRB characteristics for different radar targets. The proposed beamforming designs are superior to existing baselines with better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and a more appropriate beampattern for sensing the 3D ET. Besides, our proposed ISACGNN can effectively mimic the dynamic structures of the SINR, sum rate, and CRB, demonstrating remarkable scalability.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Matrix Factorizations with Volume-based Constraints and Regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix factorizations are a class of linear models widely used in various fields such as machine learning, signal processing, and data analysis. These models approximate a matrix as the product of two smaller matrices, where the left matrix captures latent features while the right matrix linearly decomposes the data based on these features. There are many ways to define what makes a component "important." Standard LRMFs, such as the truncated singular value decomposition, focus on minimizing the distance between the original matrix and its low-rank approximation. In this thesis, the notion of "importance" is closely linked to interpretability and uniqueness, which are key to obtaining reliable and meaningful results.
  This thesis thus focuses on volume-based constraints and regularizations designed to enhance interpretability and uniqueness. We first introduce two new volume-constrained LRMFs designed to enhance these properties. The first assumes that data points are naturally bounded (e.g., movie ratings between 1 and 5 stars) and can be explained by convex combinations of features within the same bounds, allowing them to be interpreted in the same way as the data. The second model is more general, constraining the factors to belong to convex polytopes. Then, two variants of volume-regularized LRMFs are proposed. The first minimizes the volume of the latent features, encouraging them to cluster closely together, while the second maximizes the volume of the decompositions, promoting sparse representations. Across all these models, uniqueness is achieved under the core principle that the factors must be "sufficiently scattered" within their respective feasible sets.
  Motivated by applications such as blind source separation and missing data imputation, this thesis also proposes efficient algorithms that make these models practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Eavesdropper Alliance: How to Achieve Symmetric Privacy in Quantum $X$-Secure $B$-Byzantine $E$-Eavesdropped $U$-Unresponsive $T$-Colluding PIR?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum \emph{symmetric} private information retrieval (QSPIR) problem in a system with $N$ databases and $K$ messages, with $U$ unresponsive servers, $T$-colluding servers, and $X$-security parameter, under several fundamental threat models. In the first model, there are $\mathcal{E}_1$ eavesdropped links in the uplink direction (the direction from the user to the $N$ servers), $\mathcal{E}_2$ eavesdropped links in the downlink direction (the direction from the servers to the user), where $|\mathcal{E}_1|, |\mathcal{E}_2| \leq E$; we coin this eavesdropper setting as \emph{dynamic} eavesdroppers. We show that super-dense coding gain can be achieved for some regimes. In the second model, we consider the case with Byzantine servers, i.e., servers that can coordinate to devise a plan to harm the privacy and security of the system together with static eavesdroppers, by listening to the same links in both uplink and downlink directions. It is important to note the considerable difference between the two threat models, since the eavesdroppers can take huge advantage of the presence of the Byzantine servers. Unlike the previous works in SPIR with Byzantine servers, that assume that the Byzantine servers can send only random symbols independent of the stored messages, we follow the definition of Byzantine servers in \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where the Byzantine servers can send symbols that can be functions of the storage, queries, as well as the random symbols in a way that can produce worse harm to the system. In the third and the most novel threat model, we consider the presence of Byzantine servers and dynamic eavesdroppers together. We show that having dynamic eavesdroppers along with Byzantine servers in the same system model creates more threats to the system than having static eavesdroppers with Byzantine servers.</description>

Abstract: Data augmentation (DA) can significantly strengthen the electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure prediction methods. However, existing DA approaches are just the linear transformations of original data and cannot explore the feature space to increase diversity effectively. Therefore, we propose a novel diffusion-based DA method called DiffEEG. DiffEEG can fully explore data distribution and generate samples with high diversity, offering extra information to classifiers. It involves two processes: the diffusion process and the denoised process. In the diffusion process, the model incrementally adds noise with different scales to EEG input and converts it into random noise. In this way, the representation of data can be learned. In the denoised process, the model utilizes learned knowledge to sample synthetic data from random noise input by gradually removing noise. The randomness of input noise and the precise representation enable the synthetic samples to possess diversity while ensuring the consistency of feature space. We compared DiffEEG with original, down-sampling, sliding windows and recombination methods, and integrated them into five representative classifiers. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. With the contribution of DiffEEG, the Multi-scale CNN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average sensitivity, FPR, AUC of 95.4%, 0.051/h, 0.932 on the CHB-MIT database and 93.6%, 0.121/h, 0.822 on the Kaggle database.</description>

      <title>Radon Implicit Field Transform (RIFT): Learning Scenes from Radar Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data acquisition in array signal processing (ASP) is costly because achieving high angular and range resolutions necessitates large antenna apertures and wide frequency bandwidths, respectively. The data requirements for ASP problems grow multiplicatively with the number of viewpoints and frequencies, significantly increasing the burden of data collection, even for simulation. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) -- neural network-based models of 3D objects and scenes -- offer compact and continuous representations with minimal radar data. They can interpolate to unseen viewpoints and potentially address the sampling cost in ASP problems. In this work, we select Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as a case from ASP and propose Radon Implicit Field Transform (RIFT). RIFT consists of two components: a classical forward model for radar (Generalized Radon Transform, GRT), and an INR based scene representation learned from radar signals. This method can be extended to other ASP problems by replacing the GRT with appropriate algorithms corresponding to different data modalities. In our experiments, we first synthesize radar data using the GRT. We then train the INR model on this synthetic data by minimizing the reconstruction error of the radar signal. After training, we render the scene using the trained INR and evaluate our scene representation against the ground truth scene. Due to the lack of existing benchmarks, we introduce two main new error metrics: phase-Root Mean Square Error (p-RMSE) for radar signal interpolation, and magnitude-Structural Similarity Index measure(m-SSIM) for scene reconstruction. These metrics adapt traditional error measures to account for the complex nature of radar signals. Compared to traditional scene models in radar signal processing, with only 10% data footprint, our RIFT model achieves up to 188% improvement in scene reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Resolution-Adaptive Micro-Doppler Spectrogram for Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising demand for remote-sensing systems for detecting hazardous situations has led to increased interest in radar-based human activity recognition (HAR). Conventional radar-based HAR methods predominantly rely on micro-Doppler spectrograms for recognition tasks. However, spectrograms frequently fail to effectively capture micro-Doppler signatures because of their limited linear resolution. To address this limitation, we propose a time--frequency domain representation method that adaptively adjusts the resolution based on activity characteristics. This approach nonlinearly transforms the resolution to focus on the most relevant frequency range for micro-Doppler signatures. We validate the proposed method by training deep-learning-based HAR models on datasets generated using the adaptive representation method. Experimental results demonstrate that the models trained using the proposed method achieve superior recognition accuracy compared with those trained using conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Radar Modulation Recognition via a Noise-Aware Ensemble Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic warfare support (ES) systems intercept adversary radar signals and estimate various types of signal information, including modulation schemes. The accurate and rapid identification of modulation schemes under conditions of very low signal power remains a significant challenge for ES systems. This paper proposes a recognition model based on a noise-aware ensemble learning (NAEL) framework to efficiently recognize radar modulation schemes in noisy environments. The NAEL framework evaluates the influence of noise on recognition and adaptively selects an appropriate neural network structure, offering significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and recognition performance. Furthermore, we employ feature extraction blocks to enhance the efficiency of the proposed recognition model. We present the analysis results of the recognition performance of the proposed model based on experimental data. Our recognition model demonstrates superior recognition accuracy with low computational complexity compared to conventional classification models.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Sum-Rate Maximization in Full-Duplex Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a key technology in future wireless communication networks to enable smart radio environment. To further enhance the passive beamforming capability of RIS, beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS has been proposed considering reconfigurable interconnections among different RIS elements. BD-RIS has a unique feature that cannot be enabled by conventional diagonal RIS; it can be realized by non-reciprocal circuits and thus enables an asymmetric scattering matrix. This feature provides the capability to break the wireless channel reciprocity, and has the potential to benefit full-duplex (FD) systems. In this paper, we model the BD RIS-assisted FD systems, where the impact of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and that of structural scattering, which refers to the specular reflection generated by RIS when the RIS is turned OFF, are explicitly captured. To assess the benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS, we optimise the scattering matrix, precoder and combiner to maximize the DL and UL sum-rates in the FD system. To tackle this optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordination descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Numerical results demonstrate surprising benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS that it can achieve much higher DL and UL sum-rates in the FD scenario than reciprocal BD-RIS and conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Indoor VLC Network with Secure Downlink NOMA for Body Blockage Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of indoor visible light communication (VLC) networks based on power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for mobile devices, where multiple legitimate users are equipped with photodiodes (PDs). We propose a body blockage model for both the legitimate users and eavesdropper to address scenarios where the communication links from transmitting light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to receiving devices are blocked by the bodies of all parties. Furthermore, we propose a novel LED arrangement that improves secrecy without requiring knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper. This arrangement reduces the overlapping areas covered by different LED units supporting distinct users. We also suggest two LED transmission strategies, i.e., simple and smart LED linking, and compare their performance with the conventional broadcasting in terms of transmission sum rate and secrecy sum rate. Through computer simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed strategies to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Learning State-Augmented Policies for Information Routing in Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the problem of information routing in a large-scale communication network, which can be formulated as a constrained statistical learning problem having access to only local information. We delineate a novel State Augmentation (SA) strategy to maximize the aggregate information at source nodes using graph neural network (GNN) architectures, by deploying graph convolutions over the topological links of the communication network. The proposed technique leverages only the local information available at each node and efficiently routes desired information to the destination nodes. We leverage an unsupervised learning procedure to convert the output of the GNN architecture to optimal information routing strategies. In the experiments, we perform the evaluation on real-time network topologies to validate our algorithms. Numerical simulations depict the improved performance of the proposed method in training a GNN parameterization as compared to baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Successive Bayesian Reconstructor for Channel Estimation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06551v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their antenna locations freely within a spatially continuous space. To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential. While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity. When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance losses. In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels. Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition. Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression. In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as a Bayesian channel estimator. Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Viewport Prediction, Bitrate Selection, and Beamforming Design for THz-Enabled 360{\deg} Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 360{\deg} videos require significant bandwidth to provide an immersive viewing experience. Wireless systems using terahertz (THz) frequency band can meet this high data rate demand. However, self-blockage is a challenge in such systems. To ensure reliable transmission, this paper explores THz-enabled 360{\deg} video streaming through multiple multi-antenna access points (APs). Guaranteeing users' quality of experience (QoE) requires accurate viewport prediction to determine which video tiles to send, followed by asynchronous bitrate selection for those tiles and beamforming design at the APs. To address users' privacy and data heterogeneity, we propose a content-based viewport prediction framework, wherein users' head movement prediction models are trained using a personalized federated learning (PFL) algorithm. To address asynchronous decision-making for tile bitrates and dynamic THz link connections, we formulate the optimization of bitrate selection and beamforming as a macro-action decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (MacDec-POMDP) problem. To efficiently tackle this problem for multiple users, we develop two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms based on multi-agent actor-critic methods and propose a hierarchical learning framework to train the actor and critic networks. Experimental results show that our proposed approach provides a higher QoE when compared with three benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>COMPILED: Deep Metric Learning for Defect Classification of Threaded Pipe Connections using Multichannel Partially Observed Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern manufacturing, most products are conforming. Few products are nonconforming with different defect types. The identification of defect types can help further root cause diagnosis of production lines. With the sensing technology development, process variables evolved as time changes, which can be collected in high resolution as multichannel functional data. These functional data have rich information to characterize the process and help identify the defect types. Motivated by a real example from the threaded pipe connection process, we focus on defect classification where each sample is represented as partially observed multichannel functional data. However, the available samples for each defect type are limited and imbalanced. The functional data is partially observed since the pre-connection process before the threaded pipe connection process is unobserved as there is no sensor installed in the production line. Therefore, the defect classification based on imbalanced, multichannel, and partially observed functional data is very important but challenging. To deal with these challenges, we propose an innovative classification approach named as COMPILED based on deep metric learning. The framework leverages the power of deep metric learning to train on imbalanced datasets. A novel neural network structure is proposed to handle multichannel partially observed functional data. The results from a real-world case study demonstrate the superior accuracy of our framework when compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted NOMA Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve the secrecy communication performance of wireless users, it still faces challenges such as limited coverage and double-fading effect. To address these issues, in this paper, we utilize a novel multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless users, and investigate the physical layer secrecy problem in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. Specifically, we derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy throughput expressions of users in MF-RIS-assisted NOMA networks with external and internal eavesdroppers. The asymptotic expressions for SOP and secrecy diversity order are also analyzed under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additionally, we examine the impact of receiver hardware limitations and error transmission-induced imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the secrecy performance. Numerical results indicate that: i) under the same power budget, the secrecy performance achieved by MF-RIS significantly outperforms active RIS and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS; ii) with increasing power budget, residual interference caused by imperfect SIC surpasses thermal noise as the primary factor affecting secrecy capacity; and iii) deploying additional elements at the MF-RIS brings significant secrecy enhancements for the external eavesdropping scenario, in contrast to the internal eavesdropping case.</description>

      <title>Continuous Sleep Depth Index Annotation with Deep Learning Yields Novel Digital Biomarkers for Sleep Health</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional sleep staging categorizes sleep and wakefulness into five coarse-grained classes, overlooking subtle variations within each stage. It provides limited information about the duration of arousal and may hinder research on sleep fragmentation and relevant sleep disorders. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning method for automatic and scalable annotation of continuous sleep depth index (SDI) using existing discrete sleep staging labels. Our approach was validated using polysomnography from over 10,000 recordings across four large-scale cohorts. The results showcased a strong correlation between the decrease in sleep depth index and the increase in duration of arousal. Specific case studies indicated that the sleep depth index captured more nuanced sleep structures than conventional sleep staging. Gaussian mixture models based on the digital biomarkers extracted from the sleep depth index identified two subtypes of sleep, where participants in the disturbed sleep group had a higher prevalence of sleep apnea, insomnia, poor subjective sleep quality, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The disturbed subtype was associated with a 42% (hazard ratio 1.42, 95% CI 1.24-1.62) increased risk of mortality and a 29% (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.00-1.67) increased risk of fatal cardiovascular disease. Our study underscores the utility of the proposed method for continuous sleep depth annotation, which could reveal more detailed information about the sleep structure and yield novel digital biomarkers for routine clinical use in sleep medicine.</description>

      <title>Surpassing Cosine Similarity for Multidimensional Comparisons: Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in computational power and hardware efficiency have enabled the tackling of increasingly complex and high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) achieved remarkable results, the interpretability of high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, which is essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), or k-means clustering. Common metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance are often used for such comparisons - for example in muscular synergies of the human motor control system. However, their applicability and interpretability diminish as dimensionality increases. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of dimensionality on these metrics. Our results reveal significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimensionality of the vectors, leading to biased and poorly interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce the Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM) which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Set Myoelectric Gesture Recognition via Dual-Perspective Inconsistency Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gesture recognition based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has achieved significant progress in human-machine interaction (HMI), especially in prosthetic control and movement rehabilitation. However, accurately recognizing predefined gestures within a closed set is still inadequate in practice; a robust open-set system needs to effectively reject unknown gestures while correctly classifying known ones, which is rarely explored in the field of myoelectric gesture recognition. To handle this challenge, we first report a significant distinction in prediction inconsistency discovered for unknown classes, which arises from different perspectives and can substantially enhance open-set recognition performance. Based on this insight, we propose a novel dual-perspective inconsistency learning approach, PredIN, to explicitly magnify the prediction inconsistency by enhancing the inconsistency of class feature distribution within different perspectives. Specifically, PredIN maximizes the class feature distribution inconsistency among the dual perspectives to enhance their differences. Meanwhile, it optimizes inter-class separability within an individual perspective to maintain individual performance. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the PredIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin. Our proposed method simultaneously achieves accurate closed-set classification for predefined gestures and effective rejection for unknown gestures, exhibiting its efficacy and superiority in open-set gesture recognition based on sEMG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) enables promising Tbps-level wireless transmission thanks to its prospect of ultra-huge spectrum utilization and narrow beamforming in the next sixth-generation (6G) communication system. Compared to millimeter wave (mmWave), THz intrinsically possesses compellingly severer molecular absorption and high pathloss serving confined coverage area. These defects should be well conquered under the employment of ultra-thin 3D beamforming with enormous deployed antennas with high beam gains. However, pencil-beams require substantially high overhead of time and power to train its optimal THz beamforming direction. We propose an energy efficient (EE) oriented THz beamforming (EETBF) scheme by separating the original complex problem into beamforming training (EETBF-BT) acquirement and learning-enabled training power assignment (EETBF-PA). The historical beam data is employed to update next beam selection policy. The performance results have demonstrated that the proposed EETBF outperforms the existing benchmarks leveraging full beam search, iterative search, linear/binary search as well as non-power-control based mechanism in open literature. Our proposed EETBF scheme results in the lowest training latency and power consumption, achieving the highest effective rate and EE performance.</description>

      <title>What If We Had Used a Different App? Reliable Counterfactual KPI Analysis in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), the operation of the radio access network (RAN) is managed by applications, or apps for short, deployed at intelligent controllers. These apps are selected from a given catalog based on current contextual information. For instance, a scheduling app may be selected on the basis of current traffic and network conditions. Once an app is chosen and run, it is no longer possible to directly test the key performance indicators (KPIs) that would have been obtained with another app. In other words, we can never simultaneously observe both the actual KPI, obtained by the selected app, and the counterfactual KPI, which would have been attained with another app, for the same network condition, making individual-level counterfactual KPIs analysis particularly challenging. This what-if analysis, however, would be valuable to monitor and optimize the network operation, e.g., to identify suboptimal app selection strategies. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the values of KPIs that would have been obtained if a different app had been implemented by the RAN. To this end, we propose a conformal-prediction-based counterfactual analysis method for wireless systems that provides reliable error bars for the estimated KPIs, despite the inherent covariate shift between logged and test data. Experimental results for medium access control-layer apps and for physical-layer apps demonstrate the merits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Design and In-training Optimization of Binary Search ADC for Flexible Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer distinct advantages, including mechanical flexibility and low process temperatures, enabling extremely low-cost production. To address the demands of applications such as smart sensors and wearables, flexible devices must be small and operate at low supply voltages. Additionally, target applications often require classifiers to operate directly on analog sensory input, necessitating the use of Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) to process the sensory data. However, ADCs present serious challenges, particularly in terms of high area and power consumption, especially when considering stringent area and energy budget. In this work, we target common classifiers in this domain such as MLPs and SVMs and present a holistic approach to mitigate the elevated overhead of analog to digital interfacing in FE. First, we propose a novel design for Binary Search ADC that reduces area overhead 2X compared with the state-of-the-art Binary design and up to 5.4X compared with Flash ADC. Next, we present an in-training ADC optimization in which we keep the bare-minimum representations required and simplifying ADCs by removing unnecessary components. Our in-training optimization further reduces on average the area in terms of transistor count of the required ADCs by 5X for less than 1% accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>On the Crucial Role of Initialization for Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work revisits the classical low-rank matrix factorization problem and unveils the critical role of initialization in shaping convergence rates for such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We introduce Nystrom initialization, which significantly improves the global convergence of Scaled Gradient Descent (ScaledGD) in both symmetric and asymmetric matrix factorization tasks. Specifically, we prove that ScaledGD with Nystrom initialization achieves quadratic convergence in cases where only linear rates were previously known. Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonly used for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA with Nystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across various downstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large language and diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Federated GNNs for EEG-Based Stroke Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to become an essential tool in supporting clinical decision-making processes, offering enhanced diagnostic capabilities and personalized treatment plans. However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</description>
