      <title>Explicit equivalence between the spectral localizer and local Chern and winding markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral localizer invariant.
  However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here, we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible to a broader physics audience.</description>

      <title>The Quadrupole Moment of Higher-Order Topological Insulator at Finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the higher-order topological insulators at finite temperature based on a generalized real-space quadrupole moment, which extends the ground state expectations to ensemble averages. Our study reveals that chiral symmetry alone dictates that the quadrupole moment must be quantized to two values of $0$ and $1/2$, even at finite temperature. It is found that finite temperature can induce a topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. Furthermore, we found that the anisotropic intra-cell hopping can lead to a reentrant topological phase transition, in which the system becomes topological again with rising temperature. This reentrant behavior is in stark contrast to the results at zero temperature. We also investigate the effects of the quasi-disorder hopping on the topology. It is found that the initially trivial system can be driven into a topological phase with strong enough disorder strength, which closely resembles the topological Anderson transition. Our work provides an example for studying the finite temperature topology of higher-order topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Self-strain suppression of the metal-to-insulator transition in phase-change oxide devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials exhibiting phase transitions which can be controlled through external stimuli, such as electric fields, are promising for future computing technologies beyond conventional semiconductor transistors. Devices that take advantage of structural phase transitions have inherent built-in memory, reminiscent of synapses and neurons, and are thus natural candidates for neuromorphic computing. Of particular interest are phase-change oxides, which allow for control over the metal-to-insulator transition. Here, we report X-ray nano-diffraction structural imaging of micro-devices fabricated with the archetypal phase-change material vanadium sesquioxide (V$_2$O$_3$). The devices contain a Ga ion-irradiated region where the metal-to-insulator transition critical temperature is lowered, a useful feature for controlling neuron-like spiking behavior. Results show that strain, induced by crystal lattice mismatch between the pristine and irradiated material, leads to a suppression of the metal-to-insulator-transition. Suppression occurs within the irradiated region or along its edges, depending on the defect-distribution and the size of the region. The observed self-straining effect could extend to other phase-change oxides and dominate as device dimensions are reduced and become too small to dissipate strain within the irradiated region. The findings are important for phase engineering in phase-change devices and highlight the necessity to study phase transitions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Precision high-speed quantum logic with holes on a natural silicon foundry platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots leverage established semiconductor infrastructure and offer a scalable path toward transformative quantum technologies. Holes spins in silicon offer compact all-electrical control, whilst retaining all the salient features of a quantum dot qubit architecture. However, silicon hole spin qubits are not as advanced as electrons, due to increased susceptibility to disorder and more complex spin physics. Here we demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities up to 99.8% and a two-qubit gate quality factor of 240, indicating a physical fidelity limit of 99.7%. These results represent the highest performance reported in natural silicon to date, made possible by fast qubit control, exchange pulsing, and industrial-grade fabrication. Notably, we achieve these results in a near-identical device as used for highly reproducible, high-fidelity electron spin qubits. With isotopic purification and device-level optimisations in the future, our hole spin qubits are poised to unlock a new operation regime for quantum CMOS architectures.</description>

      <title>Localized states and skin effect around non-Hermitian impurities in tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the generalized Bloch theorem formalism of Alase {\it et al.} [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 117} 076804 (2016)] to analyze simple one-dimensional tight-binding lattice systems connected by Hermitian bonds (all with the same hopping parameter $t$), but containing one bond impurity which can be either Hermitian or non-Hermitian. We calculate the band structure, the bulk-boundary correspondence indicator ($D_L(\epsilon)$) and analyze the eigenvalues of the lattice translation operator ($z$), for each eigenstate. From the $z$ values the generalized Brillouin zone can be reconstructed. If the impurity is Hermitian (and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric), we find a parameter regime in which two localized edge states separate from the tight-binding band. We then simulate a non-Hermitian impurity by keeping hopping in one direction of the bond impurity the same as the rest of the tight-binding system, and varying only its reciprocal. Again, we find a region with localized edge states, but in this case the energy eigenvalues are purely imaginary. We also find that in this case the two zero energy eigenvectors coalesce, hence this system is an exceptional line. We then perform an interpolative scan between the above two scenarios and find that there is an intermediate region exhibiting a non-Hermitian skin effect. In this region a macroscopic fraction of states acquire complex energy eigenvalues and exhibit localization towards the impurity. Our numerical results are supported by a detailed analysis of the solutions of the boundary/impurity equation.</description>

      <title>Wave-mixing cathodoluminescence microscopy of low-frequency excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical phenomena such as parametric amplification and frequency conversion are typically driven by external optical fields. Free electrons can also act as electromagnetic sources, offering unmatched spatial precision. Combining optical and electron-induced fields via the nonlinear response of material structures therefore holds potential for revealing new physical phenomena and enabling disruptive applications. Here, we theoretically investigate wave mixing between external light and the evanescent fields of free electrons, giving rise to inelastic photon scattering mediated by the second-order nonlinear response of a specimen. Specifically, an incident photon may be blue- or red-shifted, while the passing electron correspondingly loses or gains energy. These processes are strongly enhanced when the frequency shift matches an optical resonance of the specimen. We present a general theoretical framework to quantify the photon conversion probability and demonstrate its application by revealing far-infrared vibrational fingerprints of retinal using only visible light. Beyond its fundamental interest, this phenomenon offers a practical approach for spatially mapping low-frequency excitations with nanometer resolution using visible photon energies and existing electron microscopes.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to WSMs, but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description>

      <title>Vector spin Seebeck effect and spin swapping effect in antiferromagnetic insulators with non-collinear spin structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets (AFs) are prospective for next-generation high-density and high-speed spintronic applications due to their negligible stray field and ultrafast spin dynamics, notwithstanding the challenges in detecting and manipulating AF order with no magnetization (M = 0). Among the AFs, non-collinear AFs are of particular interest because of their unique properties arising from the non-collinear spin structure and the small magnetization M. In this work, we describe the recently observed vector spin Seebeck effect in non-collinear LuFeO$_3$, where the magneto-thermovoltage under an in-plane temperature gradient, not previously observed, is consistent with the predicted spin swapping effect. Our results shed light on the importance of the non-collinear spin structure in the emerging spin phenomena in non-collinear AFs and offer a new class of materials for AF spintronics and spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Anyon superfluid in trilayer quantum Hall systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intertwining intrinsic topological order with gapless collective modes remains a central challenge in many-body physics. We show that a quantum-Hall trilayer at $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu_{3}= \frac13$, tuned solely by the inter-layer spacing $d$, realizes this goal. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations and a Chern-Simons field theory analysis reveal an intermediate ``anyon-exciton condensate'' separating the familiar $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=1$ exciton condensate ($d \to 0$) from three decoupled Laughlin liquids ($d \to \infty$). In this phase, neutral bi-excitons condense while a $\nu=\frac23$ Laughlin topological order survives, yielding a Goldstone mode coexisting with fractionalized anyons. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis maps out the finite-temperature phase diagram. The anyon-exciton condensate can be experimentally verified through a vanishing double-counter-flow resistance and a fractional layer-resolved Hall resistivity $R_{xy}=\frac{5}{2} h/e^{2}$, both within reach of existing high-mobility trilayer devices.</description>

      <title>Switchable Exchange Bias Resulting from Correlated Domain Structures in Orthogonally Coupled Antiferromagnet/Ferromagnet van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructures offer a versatile platform for engineering interfacial spin interactions with atomic precision, enabling nontrivial spin textures and dynamic behaviors. In this work, we report robust asymmetric magnetization reversal and exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), driven by interlayer exchange coupling with the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr. Despite the orthogonal magnetic anisotropies out-of-plane easy axis in FGT and in-plane in CrSBr, we observe a strong interfacial exchange interaction that gives rise to pronounced and switchable exchange bias and asymmetric switching in FGT, persisting up to the N\'eel temperature of CrSBr (132 K) as revealed by anomalous Hall effect measurements.
  We uncover the microscopic origin of this behavior through cross-sectional magnetic imaging of the domain structure using off-axis electron holography. The results reveal that the asymmetric switching and exchange bias arise from the influence of CrSBr on the domain configuration of FGT, where the in-plane antiferromagnetic state of CrSBr promotes the formation of stripe-like domain structures in FGT with circular rotation of magnetization in the cross-sectional bc plane defined by the easy axes of both FGT and CrSBr. These findings elucidate the mechanism of exchange bias in orthogonally coupled van der Waals systems and demonstrate a pathway for stabilizing three-dimensional domain structures in ferromagnets through interfacial exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Effective 2D Envelope Function Theory for Silicon Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous method to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) description of a quantum dot in silicon to an effective two-dimensional (2D) envelope function theory for electron spin qubits. By systematically integrating out the strongly confined vertical dimension using a Born-Oppenheimer-inspired ansatz at the envelope-function level, we derive an effective in-plane potential that faithfully captures the essential electrostatics of the full 3D system. Considering the lowest two eigenstates of the out-of-plane direction, this reduction leads to the natural and explicit emergence of the valley degree of freedom within a 2D formalism, which is derived here from first principles. We validate the accuracy of the method through comparisons with full 3D simulations and demonstrate its superiority over naive 2D slicing, particularly in the presence of interface roughness. Crucially, the reduction in dimensionality leads to substantial computational savings, making our approach particularly well suited for simulating two-electron systems, e.g., for the extraction of parameters such as the exchange coupling. Beyond its practical utility, the rigorous 2D envelope function theory that is introduced in this study incorporates valley physics in a physically grounded manner, offering conceptual clarity on the role of valley states in qubit operation and measurement.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconductivity from extremely dilute magnetic disorder in 2H-NbSe2-xSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most superconducting materials exhibit a vanishing density of states at the Fermi level and Anderson's theorem posits that the superconducting gap is robust against nonmagnetic disorder. Although dilute magnetic impurities lead to localized in-gap states, these states typically have no bearing on the material's bulk superconducting properties. However, numerous experiments reveal a finite density of states at the Fermi level in systems with an apparently negligible number of magnetic impurities. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations, we find that gapless superconductivity emerges in 2H-NbSe2-xSx at remarkably low magnetic impurity concentrations. Furthermore, our density functional theory calculations and in-gap quasiparticle interference measurements demonstrate that the Se-S substitution significantly modifies the band structure. This modification favours nesting and dictates the in-gap scattering for x&gt;0, in stark contrast to the dominant charge density wave interactions in pure 2H-NbSe2. Our findings reveal an unusual superconducting response to disorder and highlight the importance of incorporating material-specific band structures in the understanding of a superconductor's response to even very low concentrations of magnetic impurities.</description>

      <title>Replacement-Type Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and with neutral atom qubits. By making use of the extended Hilbert space, including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise-bias which motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with error correction.</description>

Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Photon-mediated interactions and dynamics of coherently driven quantum emitters in complex photonic environments</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Born-Markov master equations based on tracing out the electromagnetic degrees of freedom have been extensively employed in the description of quantum optical phenomena originating from photon-mediated interactions in quantum emitter ensembles. The breakdown of these effective models, built on assumptions such as ensemble spectral homogeneity, an unstructured photonic density of states, and weak light-matter coupling, has also recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigate the accuracy of this well-established framework beyond the most conventional, and extensively explored, spontaneous emission configuration. Specifically, we consider a system comprising two coherently driven and detuned quantum emitters, embedded within a hybrid photonic-plasmonic cavity, formed by a metallic nanorod integrated into a high-refractive-index dielectric microresonator. The local density of photonic states in this structure exhibits a complex frequency dependence, making it a compelling platform for exploring photon-mediated interactions beyond the assumptions above. We benchmark this modeling approach for the quantum dynamics of the emitter pair against exact calculations based on a macroscopic field quantization formalism, providing an illustrative assessment of its validity in significantly structured and dispersive photonic environments. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes of laser driving and frequency splitting that lead to markedly different levels of accuracy in the effective model.</description>

      <title>Theory of hybrid collective excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Triplet correlations in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures: dependence on type of antiferromagnetic ordering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a number of studies have predicted the emergence of a nontrivial proximity effect in superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) heterostructures. This effect is of considerable interest for the efficient integration of antiferromagnetic materials into the fields of superconducting spintronics and electronics. A key element of this proximity effect is the Neel triplet correlations, initially predicted for S/AF heterostructures with checkerboard G-type antiferromagnetic ordering. However, various forms of antiferromagnetic ordering exist, and an important open question concerns the generalization of these results to such cases. In this paper, we develop a theory of the proximity effect in S/AF heterostructures with arbitrary two-sublattice antiferromagnetic ordering, aiming to clarify which antiferromagnets are capable of inducing triplet correlations and what structure these correlations may exhibit. We show that, in S/AF heterostructures with collinear compensated antiferromagnets, the dominant superconducting triplet correlations are of the checkerboard Neel type, as originally predicted for G-type antiferromagnets. In contrast, layered Neel triplet correlations, although potentially generated by layered antiferromagnets, are significantly weaker. Consequently, in S/AF heterostructures with layered antiferromagnetic ordering, the proximity-induced triplet correlations may exhibit either a checkerboard Neel or a conventional ferromagnetic structure, depending on the specific antiferromagnet and its orientation relative to the S/AF interface.</description>

      <title>XANES absorption spectra of penta-graphene and penta-SiC2 with different terminations: a computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent research, penta-graphene and penta-SiC2 have emerged as innovative 2D materials consisting exclusively of pentagons. However, there is still a significant gap in the theoretical characterization of these materials, which hinders progress in their synthesis and potential technological applications. This study aims to close this gap by investigating the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of these materials through ab initio calculations. In particular, we analyze the XANES spectra of penta-graphene in its pristine, hydrogenated, and hydroxylated states, and we investigate the effects of substitution by a single silicon in both penta-graphene and pentagraphane. In addition, we calculate the XANES spectra for pristine and hydrogenated penta-SiC2. This work sets the stage for the possible identification of penta-graphene and penta-SiC2 phases by X-ray spectroscopy at the experimental level and lays the foundation for the future engineering of the absorption properties of these materials in optical devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle wells) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by an empirical nonlocal pseudopotential model to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interactions between valley states across neighboring Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Non-Hermitian Topology Associated with Non-Toroidal Brillouin Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are prominent non-Hermitian band degeneracies that give rise to a variety of intriguing and unconventional phenomena. Similar to Weyl and Dirac points, EPs carry topological charges and comply with the celebrated fermion doubling theorems in lattices. Beyond these characteristics, EPs exhibit more exotic topological properties, particularly non-Abelian braiding topologies not seen in conventional degeneracies. Here, we investigate these foundational concepts of EPs in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices where the fundamental domain of the Brillouin zone is a Klein bottle, rather than a torus assumed in previous studies. We find that EPs do not necessarily appear in pairs with opposite topological charges in the Brillouin Klein bottle, thus violating the fermion doubling theorem. The violation occurs because, without crossing the boundary, the sum of the topological charges of EPs is in fact an even number rather than zero. Moreover, we uncover unique braiding topologies of EPs that cannot be captured by existing theories. Specifically, the composite braidings around all EPs equals the braiding along the boundary of the Brillouin Klein bottle. This novel braiding topology further confirms the failure of the fermion doubling theorem, and allows us to explore the non-Abelian braidings of EPs beyond the scope of topological charges. Our work highlights the fundamental role of Brillouin-zone topology in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent linear response for gapped nodal-line semimetals in planar-Hall configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity for ideal nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), with a finite but tiny mass-gap, in distinct planar-Hall set-ups. Each differing configuration results from the relative orientation of the nodal-ring's plane with respect to the plane spanned by the electric ($\mathbf E $) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields. The net conductivity tensor has components comprising the Drude, anomalous-Hall, in-plane (with $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf B$) longitudinal and transverse, and Lorentz-force-operator-induced parts. Our results feature the signatures of the inherent topology of a gapped NLSM, revealed through nonzero values of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. In particular, we show that both of these vector fields, arising in the momentum space, give rise to terms of comparable magnitudes in the resulting response. Our explicit theoretical expressions will help identify unique signatures of NLSMs in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (PSA-STT-MRAM) is a recent concept proposed to maintain the thermal stability of standard MRAM at small diameters, considering thick vertical pillars as the free layer. In order to explore the specific physics of PSA-STT-MRAMs expected in relation with their three-dimensional nature, we have performed simulations combining a micromagnetic model coupled self-consistently with spin-dependent transport equations. The 3D shape induces flower states at the upper and lower surfaces. Besides, the field-like component of STT is found to be larger than in standard MRAMs, suggesting that it needs to be considered. The combination of both effects leads to the excitation of high-order 3D ferromagnetic resonance modes, playing a key role in magnetisation reversal. These results highlight features of 3D nanomagnetic systems, largely disregarded so far, which need to be considered to optimise PSA-STT-MRAM to be a competitive solution for technological implementation.</description>

Abstract: The growing interest in quantum magnonics is driving the development of advanced techniques for generating, controlling, and detecting non-classical magnonic states. Here, we explore the potential of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects coupled to a shared magnetic bath as a source of such states. We establish a theoretical framework to characterize the quantum correlations among magnons emitted by the ensemble into the bath and investigate how these correlations depend on experimentally tunable parameters. Our findings show that the emitted magnons retain the quantum correlations inherent to the solid-state emitters, paving the way for the deterministic generation of quantum many-body magnonic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.</description>
