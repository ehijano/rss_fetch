      <title>On the Semidefinite Representability of Continuous Quadratic Submodular Minimization With Applications to Moment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that continuous quadratic submodular minimization with bounds is solvable in polynomial time using semidefinite programming, and we apply this result to two moment problems arising in distributionally robust optimization and the computation of covariance bounds. Accordingly, this research advances the ongoing study of continuous submodular minimization and opens new application areas therein.</description>

      <title>Mode Participation and Inter-Area-Observability Blocking Controllers for Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent papers [1] and [2], the second author developed full-state feedback controllers for networked systems to block the observability and controllability of certain remote nodes. In this paper, we build on these control schemes to an interconnected power system with the aims of blocking (i) mode participation factors and (ii) inter-area mode observability in tie-line power flow measurements. Since participation factors depend on both controllable and observable eigenvectors, the control techniques from the cited works must be carefully tailored to this setting. Our research is motivated by cyber-security concerns in power systems, where an adversary aims to deceive the operator by tampering the system's modal content. We present extensive numerical results on a 3-machine, 9-bus system and a 16-machine, 68-bus system.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm to Solve Cardinality Constrained Quadratic Optimization Problem with an Application to the Best Subset Selection in Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lot of problems, from fields like sparse signal processing, statistics, portfolio selection, and machine learning, can be formulated as a cardinality constraint optimization problem. The cardinality constraint gives the problem a discrete nature, making it computationally challenging to solve as the dimension of the problem increases. In this work, we present an algorithm to solve the cardinality constraint quadratic optimization problem using the framework of the interval branch-and-bound. Interval branch-and-bound is a popular approach for finding a globally optimal solution in the field of global optimization. The proposed method is capable of solving problems of a wide range of dimensions. In particular, we solve the classical best subset selection problem in regression and compare our algorithm against another branch-and-bound method and GUROBI's quadratic mixed integer solver. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the first and is competitive with the second solver.</description>

      <title>Computing cone-constrained singular values of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of singular values of a rectangular matrix $A$ relative to a pair of closed convex cones $(P,Q)$ has been recently introduced by Seeger and Sossa (Cone-constrained singular value problems, Journal of Convex Analysis 30, pp. 1285-1306, 2023). These singular values are the critical (stationary) values of the non-convex optimization problem of minimizing $\langle u,Av\rangle$ such that $u$ and $v$ are unit vectors in $P$ and $Q$, respectively. When $A$ is the identity matrix, the singular values coincide with the cosine of the critical angles between $P$ and $Q$. When $P$ and $Q$ are positive orthants, the singular values are called Pareto singular values of $A$ and have applications, for instance, in spectral graph theory. This paper deals with the numerical computation of these cone-constrained singular values. We prove the NP-hardness of all the above problems, while identifying cases when such problems can be solved in polynomial time. We then propose four algorithms. Two are exact algorithms, meaning that they are guaranteed to compute a globally optimal solution; one uses an exact non-convex quadratic programming solver, and the other a brute-force active-set method. The other two are heuristics, meaning that they rapidly compute locally optimal solutions; one uses an alternating projection algorithm with extrapolation, and the other a sequential partial linearization approach based on fractional programming. We illustrate the use of these algorithms on several examples.</description>

      <title>Curvature accelerated decentralized non-convex optimization for high-dimensional machine learning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider distributed optimization as motivated by machine learning in a multi-agent system: each agent holds local data and the goal is to minimize an aggregate loss function over a common model, via an interplay of local training and distributed communication. In the most interesting case of training a neural network, the loss functions are non-convex and the high dimension of the model poses challenges in terms of communication and computation. We propose a primal-dual method that leverages second order information in the local training sub-problems in order to accelerate the algorithm. To ease the computational burden, we invoke a quasi-Newton local solver with linear cost in the model dimension. Besides, our method is communication efficient in the sense of requiring to broadcast the local model only once per round. We rigorously establish the convergence of the algorithm and demonstrate its merits by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A note on time-inconsistent stochastic control problems with higher-order moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the research on time-consistent stochastic control problems with higher-order moments, as formulated by [Y. Wang et al. SIAM J. Control. Optim., 63 (2025), in press]. We consider a linear controlled dynamic equation with state-dependent diffusion, and let the sum of a conventional mean-variance utility and a fairly general function of higher-order central moments be the objective functional. We obtain both the sufficiency and necessity of the equilibrium condition for an open-loop Nash equilibrium control (ONEC), under some continuity and integrability assumptions that are more relaxed and natural than those employed before. Notably, we derive an extended version of the stochastic Lebesgue differentiation theorem for necessity, because the equilibrium condition is represented by some diagonal processes generated by a flow of backward stochastic differential equations whose the data do not necessarily satisfy the usual square-integrability. Based on the derived equilibrium condition, we obtain the algebra equation for a deterministic ONEC. In particular, we find that the mean-variance equilibrium strategy is an ONEC for our higher-order moment problem if and only if the objective functional satisfies a homogeneity condition.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual Gradient Descent Approach to the Connectivity Constrained Sensor Coverage Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor networks play a critical role in many situational awareness applications. In this paper, we study the problem of determining sensor placements to balance coverage and connectivity objectives over a target region. Leveraging algebraic graph theory, we formulate a novel optimization problem to maximize sensor coverage over a spatial probability density of event likelihoods while adhering to connectivity constraints. To handle the resulting non-convexity under constraints, we develop an augmented Lagrangian-based gradient descent algorithm inspired by recent approaches to efficiently identify points satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We establish convergence guarantees by showing necessary assumptions are satisfied in our setup, including employing Mangasarian-Fromowitz constraint qualification to prove the existence of a KKT point. Numerical simulations under different probability densities demonstrate that the optimized sensor networks effectively cover high-priority regions while satisfying desired connectivity constraints.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking for Controlled Vibrational Stabilization of Mechanical Systems: A Variation-of-Constant Averaging Approach Inspired by Flapping Insects Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel extremum seeking control (ESC) approach for the vibrational stabilization of a class of mechanical systems (e.g., systems characterized by equations of motion resulting from Newton second law or Euler-Lagrange mechanics). Inspired by flapping insects mechanics, the proposed ESC approach is operable by only one perturbation signal and can admit generalized forces that are quadratic in velocities. We test our ESC, and compare it against approaches from literature, on some classical mechanical systems (e.g., mass-spring and an inverted pendulum systems). We also provide a novel, first-of-its-kind, application of the introduced ESC by achieving a 1D model-free source-seeking of a flapping system.</description>

      <title>A New Convergence Analysis of Two Stochastic Frank-Wolfe Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence properties of the original and away-step Frank-Wolfe algorithms for linearly constrained stochastic optimization assuming the availability of unbiased objective function gradient estimates. The objective function is not restricted to a finite summation form, like in previous analyses tailored to machine-learning applications. To enable the use of concentration inequalities we assume either a uniform bound on the variance of gradient estimates or uniformly sub-Gaussian tails on gradient estimates. With one of these regularity assumptions along with sufficient sampling, we can ensure sufficiently accurate gradient estimates. We then use a Lyapunov argument to obtain the desired complexity bounds, relying on existing geometrical results for polytopes.</description>

      <title>A model for pricing freight rail transport access costs: economic and environmental perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deregulated railway markets, efficient management of infrastructure charges is essential for sustaining railway systems. This study sets out a method for infrastructure managers to price access to railway infrastructure, focusing on freight transport in deregulated market contexts. The proposed methodology integrates negative externalities directly into the pricing structure in a novel way, balancing economic and environmental objectives. it develops a dynamic freight flow model to represent the railway system, using a logit model to capture the modal split between rail and road modes based on cost, thereby reflecting demand elasticity. The model is temporally discretized, resulting in a mesoscopic, discrete-event simulation framework, integrated into an optimization model that determines train path charges based on real-time capacity and demand. This approach aims both to maximize revenue for the infrastructure manager and to reduce the negative externalities of road transport. The methodology is demonstrated through a case study on the Mediterranean Rail Freight Corridor, showcasing the scale of access charges derived from the model. Results indicate that reducing track-access charges can yield substantial societal benefits by shifting freight demand to rail. This research provides a valuable framework for transport policy, suggesting that externality-sensitive infrastructure charges can promote more efficient and sustainable use of railway infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Direct-search methods for decentralized blackbox optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derivative-free optimization algorithms are particularly useful for tackling blackbox optimization problems where the objective function arises from complex and expensive procedures that preclude the use of classical gradient-based methods. In contemporary decentralized environments, such functions are defined locally on different computational nodes due to technical or privacy constraints, introducing additional challenges within the optimization process.
  In this paper, we adapt direct-search methods, a classical technique in derivative-free optimization, to the decentralized setting. In contrast with zeroth-order algorithms, our algorithms rely on positive spanning sets to define suitable search directions, while still possessing global convergence guarantees thanks to carefully chosen stepsizes. Numerical experiments highlight the advantages of direct-search techniques over gradient-approximation-based strategies.</description>

      <title>Randomised Splitting Methods and Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an explicit link between stochastic gradient descent using common batching strategies and splitting methods for ordinary differential equations. From this perspective, we introduce a new minibatching strategy (called Symmetric Minibatching Strategy) for stochastic gradient optimisation which shows greatly reduced stochastic gradient bias (from $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$ in the optimiser stepsize $h$), when combined with momentum-based optimisers. We justify why momentum is needed to obtain the improved performance using the theory of backward analysis for splitting integrators and provide a detailed analytic computation of the stochastic gradient bias on a simple example.
  Further, we provide improved convergence guarantees for this new minibatching strategy using Lyapunov techniques that show reduced stochastic gradient bias for a fixed stepsize (or learning rate) over the class of strongly-convex and smooth objective functions. Via the same techniques we also improve the known results for the Random Reshuffling strategy for stochastic gradient descent methods with momentum. We argue that this also leads to a faster convergence rate when considering a decreasing stepsize schedule. Both the reduced bias and efficacy of decreasing stepsizes are demonstrated numerically on several motivating examples.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Convergence of Frank--Wolfe Algorithms with Adaptive Bregman Step-Size Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Frank--Wolfe (FW) algorithm with an adaptive Bregman step-size strategy for smooth adaptable (also called: relatively smooth) (weakly-) convex functions. This means that the gradient of the objective function is not necessarily Lipschitz continuous, and we only require the smooth adaptable property. Compared to existing FW algorithms, our assumptions are less restrictive. We establish convergence guarantees in various settings, such as sublinear to linear convergence rates, depending on the assumptions for convex and nonconvex objective functions. Assuming that the objective function is weakly convex and satisfies the local quadratic growth condition, we provide both local sublinear and local linear convergence regarding the primal gap. We also propose a variant of the away-step FW algorithm using Bregman distances. We establish global accelerated (up to linear) convergence for convex optimization under the H\"{o}lder error bound condition and its local linear convergence for nonconvex optimization under the local quadratic growth condition over polytopes. Numerical experiments on nonnegative linear inverse problems, $\ell_p$ loss problems, phase retrieval, low-rank minimization, and nonnegative matrix factorization demonstrate that our proposed FW algorithms outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>Robust charging station location and routing-scheduling for electric modular autonomous units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem definition: Motivated by global electrification targets and the advent of electric modular autonomous units (E-MAUs), this paper addresses a robust charging station location and routing-scheduling problem (E-RCRSP) in an inter-modal transit system, presenting a novel solution to traditional electric bus scheduling. The system integrates regular bus services, offering full-line or sectional coverage, and short-turning services. Considering the fast-charging technology with quick top-ups, we jointly optimize charging station locations and capacities, fleet sizing, as well as routing-scheduling for E-MAUs under demand uncertainty. E-MAUs can couple flexibly at different locations, and their routing-scheduling decisions include sequences of services, as well as charging times and locations. Methodology: The E-RCRSP is formulated as a path-based robust optimization model, incorporating the polyhedral uncertainty set. We develop a double-decomposition algorithm that combines column-and-constraint generation and column generation armed with a tailored label-correcting approach. To improve computational efficiency and scalability, we propose a novel method that introduces super travel arcs and network downsizing methodologies. Results: Computational results from real-life instances, based on operational data of advanced NExT E-MAUs with cutting-edge batteries provided by our industry partner, indicate that charging at both depots and en-route fast-charging stations is necessary during operations. Moreover, our algorithm effectively scales to large-scale operational cases involving entire-day operations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Comparisons with fixed-composition buses under the same fleet investment suggest that our methods are able to achieve substantial reductions in passengers' costs by flexibly scheduling units.</description>

      <title>AI2STOW: End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning to Construct Master Stowage Plans under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worldwide economy and environmental sustainability depend on eff icient and reliable supply chains, in which container shipping plays a crucial role as an environmentally friendly mode of transport. Liner shipping companies seek to improve operational efficiency by solving the stowage planning problem. Due to many complex combinatorial aspects, stowage planning is challenging and often decomposed into two NP-hard subproblems: master and slot planning. This article proposes AI2STOW, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning model with feasibility projection and an action mask to create master plans under demand uncertainty with global objectives and constraints, including paired block stowage patterms. Our experimental results demonstrate that AI2STOW outperforms baseline methods from reinforcement learning and stochastic programming in objective performance and computational efficiency, based on simulated instances reflecting the scale of realistic vessels and operational planning horizons.</description>

      <title>A Doubly Stochastically Perturbed Algorithm for Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop analysis and algorithms for a class of (stochastic) bilevel optimization problems whose lower-level (LL) problem is strongly convex and linearly constrained. Most existing approaches for solving such problems rely on unrealistic assumptions or penalty function-based approximate reformulations that are not necessarily equivalent to the original problem. In this work, we develop a stochastic algorithm based on an implicit gradient approach, suitable for data-intensive applications. It is well-known that for the class of problems of interest, the implicit function is nonsmooth. To circumvent this difficulty, we apply a smoothing technique that involves adding small random (linear) perturbations to the LL objective and then taking the expectation of the implicit objective over these perturbations. This approach gives rise to a novel stochastic formulation that ensures the differentiability of the implicit function and leads to the design of a novel and efficient doubly stochastic algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to an $(\epsilon, \overline{\delta})$-Goldstein stationary point of the stochastic objective in $\widetilde{{O}}(\epsilon^{-4} \overline{\delta}^{-1})$ iterations. Moreover, under certain additional assumptions, we establish the same convergence guarantee for the algorithm to achieve a $(3\epsilon, \overline{\delta} + {O}(\epsilon))$-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective. Finally, we perform experiments on adversarial training (AT) tasks to showcase the utility of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Distributional Control of Ensemble Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble control offers rich and diverse opportunities in mathematical systems theory. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of ensemble control, referred to as distributional control, for ensemble systems. We shift the focus from controlling the states of ensemble systems to controlling the output measures induced by their aggregated measurements. To facilitate systems-theoretic analysis of these newly formulated distributional control challenges, we establish a dynamic moment kernelization approach, through which we derive the distributional system and its corresponding moment system for an ensemble system. We further explore optimal distributional control by integrating optimal transport concepts and techniques with the moment representations, creating a systematic computational distributional control framework.</description>

      <title>Minimum Cut Representability of Stable Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study Minimum Cut Representability, a framework to solve optimization and feasibility problems over stable matchings by representing them as minimum s-t cut problems on digraphs over rotations. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on objective functions and feasibility sets for problems to be minimum cut representable. In particular, we define the concepts of first and second order differentials of a function over stable matchings and show that a problem is minimum cut representable if and only if, roughly speaking, the objective function can be expressed solely using these differentials, and the feasibility set is a sublattice of the stable matching lattice. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our framework, we study a range of real-world applications, including problems involving school choice with siblings and a two-stage stochastic stable matching problem. We show how our framework can be used to help solving these problems.</description>

      <title>Global Maximum Principle for Partially Observed Risk-Sensitive Progressive Optimal Control of FBSDE with Poisson Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with one kind of partially observed progressive optimal control problems of coupled forward-backward stochastic systems driven by both Brownian motion and Poisson random measure with risk-sensitive criteria. The control domain is not necessarily convex, and the control variable can enters into all the coefficients. The observation equation also has correlated noises with the state equation. Under the Poisson jump setting, the original problem is equivalent to a complete information stochastic recursive optimal control problem of a forward-backward system with quadratic-exponential generator. In order to establish the first- and second-order variations, some new techniques are introduced to overcome difficulties caused by the quadratic-exponential feature. A new global stochastic maximum principle is deduced. As an application, a risk-sensitive optimal investment problem with factor model is studied. Moreover, the risk-sensitive stochastic filtering problem is also studied, which involves both Brownian and Poissonian correlated noises. A modified Zakai equation is obtained.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization of Stochastic Systems under Chance Constraints via Set Erosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the trajectory optimization problem under chance constraints for continuous-time stochastic systems. To address chance constraints imposed on the entire stochastic trajectory, we propose a framework based on the set erosion strategy, which converts the chance constraints into safety constraints on an eroded subset of the safe set along the corresponding deterministic trajectory. The depth of erosion is captured by the probabilistic bound on the distance between the stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart, for which we utilize a novel and sharp probabilistic bound developed recently. By adopting this framework, a deterministic control input sequence can be obtained, whose feasibility and performance are demonstrated through theoretical analysis. Our framework is compatible with various deterministic optimal control techniques, offering great flexibility and computational efficiency in a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method provides the first scalable trajectory optimization scheme for high-dimensional stochastic systems under trajectory level chance constraints. We validate the proposed method through two numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>WLPCM Approach for Great Lakes Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a water-level management model for the Great Lakes using a predictive control framework. Requirement 1: Historical data (pre-2019) revealed consistent monthly water-level patterns. A simulated annealing algorithm optimized flow control via the Moses-Saunders Dam and Compensating Works to align levels with multi-year benchmarks. Requirement 2: A Water Level Predictive Control Model (WLPCM) integrated delayed differential equations (DDEs) and model predictive control (MPC) to account for inflow/outflow dynamics and upstream time lags. Natural variables (e.g., precipitation) were modeled via linear regression, while dam flow rates were optimized over 6-month horizons with feedback adjustments for robustness. Requirement 3: Testing WLPCM on 2017 data successfully mitigated Ottawa River flooding, outperforming historical records. Sensitivity analysis via the Sobol method confirmed model resilience to parameter variations. Requirement 4: Ice-clogging was identified as the most impactful natural variable (via RMSE-based sensitivity tests), followed by snowpack and precipitation. Requirement 5: Stakeholder demands (e.g., flood prevention, ecological balance) were incorporated into a fitness function. Compared to Plan 2014, WLPCM reduced catastrophic high levels in Lake Ontario and excessive St. Lawrence River flows by prioritizing long-term optimization. Key innovations include DDE-based predictive regulation, real-time feedback loops, and adaptive control under extreme conditions. The framework balances hydrological dynamics, stakeholder needs, and uncertainty management, offering a scalable solution for large freshwater systems.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Neural Operator-Based Observer of Traffic Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of traffic density estimation with sparse measurements from stationary roadside sensors. Our approach uses Fourier neural operators to learn macroscopic traffic flow dynamics from high-fidelity microscopic-level simulations. During inference, the operator functions as an open-loop predictor of traffic evolution. To close the loop, we couple the open-loop operator with a correction operator that combines the predicted density with sparse measurements from the sensors. Simulations with the SUMO software indicate that, compared to open-loop observers, the proposed closed-loop observer exhibit classical closed-loop properties such as robustness to noise and ultimate boundedness of the error. This shows the advantages of combining learned physics with real-time corrections, and opens avenues for accurate, efficient, and interpretable data-driven observers.</description>

Renewed interest in this problem stems from the fact that it was recently discovered to serve as a modeling approach in fields of applications and from the ongoing recent research efforts to handle non-convexity in feasibility-seeking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an initial error tolerant distributed mean field control method under partial and discrete information is introduced, where each agent only has discrete observations on its own state. First, we study agents' behavior in linear quadratic mean field games (LQMFGs) under heterogeneous erroneous information of the initial mean field state (MF-S), and formulate the relationships between initial errors and systemic deviations. Next, by capturing the initial error affection on the private trajectory of an agent, we give a distributed error estimation method based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), where each agent estimates information errors only based on discrete observations on its private trajectory. Furthermore, we establish an error-based segmented state estimation method, design the initial error tolerant distributed mean field control method (IET-DMFC), and demonstrate the consistent property of state estimation as observation frequency increases. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the efficiency of the algorithm and the consistent properties.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective Optimization under Uncertainties using Conditional Pareto Fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method to tackle the problem of multiobjective optimization under parameteric uncertainties, by considering the Conditional Pareto Sets and Conditional Pareto Fronts. Based on those quantities we can define the probability of coverage of the Conditional Pareto Set which can be interpreted as the probability for a design to be optimal in the Pareto sense. Due to the computational cost of such an approach, we introduce an Active Learning method based on Gaussian Process Regression in order to improve the estimation of this probability, which relies on a reformulation of the EHVI. We illustrate those methods on a few toy problems of moderate dimension, and on the problem of designing a cabin to highlight the differences in solutions brought by different formulations of the problem.</description>

      <title>Robust Topology Optimization of Electric Machines using Topological Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-performance electric machines that maintain their efficiency and reliability under uncertain material and operating conditions is crucial for industrial applications. In this paper, we present a novel framework for robust topology optimization with partial differential equation constraints to address this challenge. The robust optimization problem is formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the inner maximization is the worst case with respect to predefined uncertainties, while the outer minimization aims to find an optimal topology that remains robust under these uncertainties using the topological derivative. The shape of the domain is represented by a level set function, which allows for arbitrary perturbation of the domain. The robust optimization problem is solved using a theorem of Clarke to compute subgradients of the worst case function. This allows the min-max problem to be solved efficiently and ensures that we find a design that performs well even in the presence of uncertainty. Finally, numerical results for a two-material permanent magnet synchronous machine demonstrate both the effectiveness of the method and the improved performance of robust designs under uncertain conditions.</description>

      <title>Transforming Ridesharing: Harnessing Role Flexibility and HOV Integration for Enhanced Mobility Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dynamic ridesharing has been extensively studied, there remains a significant research gap in exploring role flexibility within the many-to-many ridesharing scheme, where the system allows for several pickups for drivers and multiple transfers for riders. Previous works have predominantly assumed that all participants own a car and have focused on one-to-one arrangements. Additionally, there is a scarcity of research on integrating High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and mathematical modelling. This study addresses these gaps by presenting a novel Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that allows for role flexibility irrespective of car ownership and considers the implications of HOV lanes. Computational analysis highlights the benefits of incorporating role flexibility and accommodating non-car-owning participants in many-to-many ridesharing systems. Yet, excessive role shifts may create imbalances, impacting service to non-car owners. Further research should explore these correlations.</description>

      <title>Radial Epiderivative Based Line Search Methods in Nonconvex and Nonsmooth Box-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel radial epiderivative-based line search methods for solving nonsmooth and nonconvex box-constrained optimization problems. The rationale for employing the concept of radial epiderivatives is that they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for both identifying global descent directions and achieving global minimum of nonconvex and nondifferentiable functions. These properties of radial epiderivatives are combined with line search methods to develop iterative solution algorithms. The proposed methods generate search directions at each iteration where global descent directions and stopping criteria are performed by using the abilities of the radial epiderivatives. We use two line search methods, that is cyclic coordinate and particle swarm optimization techniques to generate search directions, selecting only those that exhibit descent, as determined by using approximately computed radial epiderivatives at the current point. As a particular case, these methods are applied for minimizing concave functions. In the paper, two convergence theorems are proved. One of them deals with the general line search method and covers only the set of directions generated by the method. The second convergence theorem deals with minimizing concave functions which deals not only with the generated set of directions but covers the whole set of feasible solutions. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using well-known benchmark problems from the literature. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in generating optimal or near-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mixed Integer Optimization: An Interior Point Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel solution framework for inverse mixed-integer optimization based on analytic center concepts from interior point methods. We characterize the optimality gap of a given solution, provide structural results, and propose models that can efficiently solve large problems. First, we exploit the property that mixed-integer solutions are primarily interior points that can be modeled as weighted analytic centers with unique weights. We then demonstrate that the optimality of a given solution can be measured relative to an identifiable optimal solution to the linear programming relaxation. We quantify the absolute optimality gap and pose the inverse mixed-integer optimization problem as a bi-level program where the upper-level objective minimizes the norm to a given reference cost, while the lower-level objective minimizes the absolute optimality gap to an optimal linear programming solution. We provide two models that address the discrepancies between the upper and lower-level problems, establish links with noisy and data-driven optimization, and conduct extensive numerical testing. We find that the proposed framework successfully identifies high-quality solutions in rapid computational times. Compared to the state-of-the-art trust region cutting plane method, it achieves optimal cost vectors for 95% and 68% of the instances within optimality gaps of e-2 and e-5, respectively, without sacrificing the relative proximity to the nominal cost vector. To ensure the optimality of the given solution, the proposed approach is complemented by a classical cutting plane method. It is shown to solve instances that the trust region cutting plane method could not successfully solve as well as being in very close proximity to the nominal cost vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimization of smooth, possibly nonconvex functions over the positive orthant, a key setting in Poisson inverse problems, using the exponentiated gradient (EG) method. Interpreting EG as Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) with the $e$-Exp map from information geometry as a retraction, we prove global convergence under weak assumptions -- without the need for $L$-smoothness -- and finite termination of Riemannian Armijo line search. Numerical experiments, including an accelerated variant, highlight EG's practical advantages, such as faster convergence compared to RGD based on interior-point geometry.</description>

      <title>Online Cluster-Based Parameter Control for Metaheuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of parameter setting is a crucial and significant process in metaheuristics since it can majorly impact their performance. It is a highly complex and challenging procedure since it requires a deep understanding of the optimization algorithm and the optimization problem at hand. In recent years, the upcoming rise of autonomous decision systems has attracted ongoing scientific interest in this direction, utilizing a considerable number of parameter-tuning methods. There are two types of methods: offline and online. Online methods usually excel in complex real-world problems, as they can offer dynamic parameter control throughout the execution of the algorithm. The present work proposes a general-purpose online parameter-tuning method called Cluster-Based Parameter Adaptation (CPA) for population-based metaheuristics. The main idea lies in the identification of promising areas within the parameter search space and in the generation of new parameters around these areas. The method's validity has been demonstrated using the differential evolution algorithm and verified in established test suites of low- and high-dimensional problems. The obtained results are statistically analyzed and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, including advanced auto-tuning approaches. The analysis reveals the promising solid CPA's performance as well as its robustness under a variety of benchmark problems and dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Network interdiction problems by deleting critical nodes have wide applications. However, node deletion is not always feasible in certain practical scenarios. We consider the maximum shortest path interdiction problem by upgrading nodes on trees under unit cost (MSPIT-UN$_u$). It aims to upgrade a subset of nodes to maximize the length of the shortest root-leaf distance such that the total upgrade cost under unit cost is upper bounded by a given value. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n^3)$ to solve this problem. Furthermore, we consider the related minimum cost problem of (MSPIT-UN$_u$) and propose an $O(n^3\log n)$ binary search algorithm, where a dynamic programming algorithm is exceeded in each iteration to solve its corresponding problem (MSPIT-UN$_u$). Finally, we design numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>CLCR: Contrastive Learning-based Constraint Reordering for Efficient MILP Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint ordering plays a critical role in the efficiency of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers, particularly for large-scale problems where poorly ordered constraints trigger increased LP iterations and suboptimal search trajectories. This paper introduces CLCR (Contrastive Learning-based Constraint Reordering), a novel framework that systematically optimizes constraint ordering to accelerate MILP solving. CLCR first clusters constraints based on their structural patterns and then employs contrastive learning with a pointer network to optimize their sequence, preserving problem equivalence while improving solver efficiency. Experiments on benchmarks show CLCR reduces solving time by 30% and LP iterations by 25% on average, without sacrificing solution accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of data-driven constraint ordering to enhance optimization models, offering a new paradigm for bridging mathematical programming with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Promoting Reachability Analysis and Optimization of Constrained Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constrained zonotope is a polytopic set representation widely used for set-based analysis and control of dynamic systems. This paper considers the problem of tailoring a quadratic program (QP) optimization algorithm to the particular structure of constrained zonotopes and vice-versa. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented that makes efficient use of the constrained zonotope structure. To increase the efficiency of the ADMM iterations, reachability calculations are presented that increase the sparsity of the matrices used to define a constrained zonotope. Numerical results show that the ADMM algorithm solves optimal control problems built using these reachability calculations faster than state-of-the-art QP solvers using conventional problem formulations, especially for large problems. Constrained zonotope reachability and optimization calculations are combined within a set-valued state estimation and moving horizon estimation algorithm, and a projection-based infeasibility detection method is presented for efficient safety verification of system trajectories.</description>

      <title>The Fascinating World of 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 Tensors: Its Geometry and Optimization Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This educational article highlights the geometric and algebraic complexities that distinguish tensors from matrices, to supplement coverage in advanced courses on linear algebra, matrix analysis, and tensor decompositions. Using the case of real-valued 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensors, we show how tensors violate many well-known properties of matrices: (1) The rank of a matrix is bounded by its smallest dimension, but a 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensor can be rank 3. (2) Matrices have a single typical rank, but the rank of a generic 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensor can be 2 or 3 - it has two typical ranks. (3) Any limit point of a sequence of matrices of rank $r$ is at most rank $r$, but a limit point of a sequence of 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 tensors of rank 2 can be rank 3 (a higher rank). (4) Matrices always have a best rank-$r$ approximation, but no rank-3 tensor of size 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 has a best rank-2 approximation. We unify the analysis of the matrix and tensor cases using tools from algebraic geometry and optimization, providing derivations of these surprising facts. To build intuition for the geometry of rank-constrained sets, students and educators can explore the geometry of matrix and tensor ranks via our interactive visualization tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for controlling linear dynamical systems under adversarial disturbances and cost functions. Our algorithm achieves a running time that scales polylogarithmically with the inverse of the stability margin, improving upon prior methods with polynomial dependence maintaining the same regret guarantees. The technique, which may be of independent interest, is based on a novel convex relaxation that approximates linear control policies using spectral filters constructed from the eigenvectors of a specific Hankel matrix.</description>

      <title>From Automation to Autonomy in Smart Manufacturing: A Bayesian Optimization Framework for Modeling Multi-Objective Experimentation and Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering novel materials with desired properties is essential for driving innovation. Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing have promised transformative advances in this area through real-time data integration and automated production planning and control. However, the reliance on automation alone has often fallen short, lacking the flexibility needed for complex processes. To fully unlock the potential of smart manufacturing, we must evolve from automation to autonomous systems that go beyond rigid programming and can dynamically optimize the search for solutions. Current discovery approaches are often slow, requiring numerous trials to find optimal combinations, and costly, particularly when optimizing multiple properties simultaneously. This paper proposes a Bayesian multi-objective sequential decision-making (BMSDM) framework that can intelligently select experiments as manufacturing progresses, guiding us toward the discovery of optimal design faster and more efficiently. The framework leverages sequential learning through Bayesian Optimization, which iteratively refines a statistical model representing the underlying manufacturing process. This statistical model acts as a surrogate, allowing for efficient exploration and optimization without requiring numerous real-world experiments. This approach can significantly reduce the time and cost of data collection required by traditional experimental designs. The proposed framework is compared with traditional DoE methods and two other multi-objective optimization methods. Using a manufacturing dataset, we evaluate and compare the performance of these approaches across five evaluation metrics. BMSDM comprehensively outperforms the competing methods in multi-objective decision-making scenarios. Our proposed approach represents a significant leap forward in creating an intelligent autonomous platform capable of novel material discovery.</description>

      <title>Gating is Weighting: Understanding Gated Linear Attention through In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear attention methods offer a compelling alternative to softmax attention due to their efficiency in recurrent decoding. Recent research has focused on enhancing standard linear attention by incorporating gating while retaining its computational benefits. Such Gated Linear Attention (GLA) architectures include competitive models such as Mamba and RWKV. In this work, we investigate the in-context learning capabilities of the GLA model and make the following contributions. We show that a multilayer GLA can implement a general class of Weighted Preconditioned Gradient Descent (WPGD) algorithms with data-dependent weights. These weights are induced by the gating mechanism and the input, enabling the model to control the contribution of individual tokens to prediction. To further understand the mechanics of this weighting, we introduce a novel data model with multitask prompts and characterize the optimization landscape of learning a WPGD algorithm. Under mild conditions, we establish the existence and uniqueness (up to scaling) of a global minimum, corresponding to a unique WPGD solution. Finally, we translate these findings to explore the optimization landscape of GLA and shed light on how gating facilitates context-aware learning and when it is provably better than vanilla linear attention.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the numerical reconstruction of inclusions in a semilinear elliptic equation arising in the mathematical modeling of cardiac ischemia. We propose an adaptive finite element method for the resulting constrained minimization problem that is relaxed by a phase-field approach. The \textit{a posteriori} error estimators of the adaptive algorithm consist of three components, i.e., the state variable, the adjoint variable and the complementary relation. Moreover, using tools from adaptive finite element analysis and nonlinear optimization, we establish the strong convergence for a subsequence of adaptively generated discrete solutions to a solution of the continuous optimality system. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the convergence and efficiency of the adaptive algorithm</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust trajectory optimization method for constrained nonlinear dynamical systems subject to unknown bounded disturbances. In particular, we seek optimal control policies that remain robustly feasible with respect to all possible realizations of the disturbances within prescribed uncertainty sets. To address this problem, we introduce a bi-level optimization algorithm. The outer level employs a trust-region successive convexification approach which relies on linearizing the nonlinear dynamics and robust constraints. The inner level involves solving the resulting linearized robust optimization problems, for which we derive tractable convex reformulations and present an Augmented Lagrangian method for efficiently solving them. To further enhance the robustness of our methodology on nonlinear systems, we also illustrate that potential linearization errors can be effectively modeled as unknown disturbances as well. Simulation results verify the applicability of our approach in controlling nonlinear systems in a robust manner under unknown disturbances. The promise of effectively handling approximation errors in such successive linearization schemes from a robust optimization perspective is also highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, linear regression models incorporating an optimal transport (OT) loss have been explored for applications such as supervised unmixing of spectra, music transcription, and mass spectrometry. However, these task-specific approaches often do not generalize readily to a broader class of linear models. In this work, we propose a novel algorithmic framework for solving a general class of non-negative linear regression models with an entropy-regularized OT datafit term, based on Sinkhorn-like scaling iterations. Our framework accommodates convex penalty functions on the weights (e.g. squared-$\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ norms), and admits additional convex loss terms between the transported marginal and target distribution (e.g. squared error or total variation). We derive simple multiplicative updates for common penalty and datafit terms. This method is suitable for large-scale problems due to its simplicity of implementation and straightforward parallelization.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of undiscouted infinite-horizon optimal control for deterministic systems where the classic value iteration does not converge. For such systems, we propose to use the Ces\`aro mean to define the infinitehorizon optimal control problem and the corresponding infinitehorizon value function. Moreover, for this value function, we introduce the Ces\`aro value iteration and prove its convergence for the special case of systems with periodic optimal operating behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large AI models efficiently requires distributing computation across multiple accelerators, but this often incurs significant communication overhead -- especially during gradient synchronization. We introduce Dion, a communication-efficient optimizer that retains the synchronous semantics of standard distributed training (e.g., DDP, FSDP) while substantially reducing I/O costs. Unlike conventional optimizers that synchronize full gradient matrices, Dion leverages orthonormalized updates with device-local momentum buffers, eliminating the need for full gradient exchange. It further supports an efficient sharding strategy that avoids reconstructing large matrices during training.</description>

      <title>Exact Logit-Based Product Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The share-of-choice product design (SOCPD) problem is to find the product, as defined by its attributes, that maximizes market share arising from a collection of customer types or segments. When customers follow a logit model of choice, the market share is given by a weighted sum of logistic probabilities, leading to the logit-based share-of-choice product design problem. In this paper, we develop a methodology for solving this problem to provable optimality. We first analyze the complexity of this problem, and show that this problem is theoretically intractable: it is NP-Hard to solve exactly, even when there are only two customer types, and it is furthermore NP-Hard to approximate to within a non-trivial factor. Motivated by the difficulty of this problem, we propose three different mixed-integer exponential cone programs of increasing strength for solving the problem exactly, which allow us to leverage modern integer conic program solvers such as Mosek. Using both synthetic problem instances and instances derived from real conjoint data sets, we show that our methodology can solve large instances to provable optimality or near optimality in operationally feasible time frames and yields solutions that generally achieve higher market share than previously proposed heuristics.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Extragradient Method for Nonsmooth and Low-Rank Matrix Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank and nonsmooth matrix optimization problems capture many fundamental tasks in statistics and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in recent years in developing efficient methods for \textit{smooth} low-rank optimization problems that avoid maintaining high-rank matrices and computing expensive high-rank SVDs, advances for nonsmooth problems have been slow paced.
  In this paper we consider standard convex relaxations for such problems. Mainly, we prove that under a natural \textit{generalized strict complementarity} condition and under the relatively mild assumption that the nonsmooth objective can be written as a maximum of smooth functions, the \textit{extragradient method}, when initialized with a ``warm-start'' point, converges to an optimal solution with rate $O(1/t)$ while requiring only two \textit{low-rank} SVDs per iteration. We give a precise trade-off between the rank of the SVDs required and the radius of the ball in which we need to initialize the method. We support our theoretical results with empirical experiments on several nonsmooth low-rank matrix recovery tasks, demonstrating that using simple initializations, the extragradient method produces exactly the same iterates when full-rank SVDs are replaced with SVDs of rank that matches the rank of the (low-rank) ground-truth matrix to be recovered.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Order Fulfillment in Last-Mile Drone Delivery under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drones have attracted growing interest in last-mile delivery due to their potential to significantly reduce costs and enhance operational flexibility, particularly in areas of sparse and uncertain demand where traditional truck delivery proves inefficient. This paper addresses the dynamic order fulfillment problem faced by a retailer operating a fleet of drones to service delivery requests that arrive stochastically. These delivery requests may vary in package profiles, delivery locations, and urgency. We adopt a rolling-horizon framework for order fulfillment and devise a two-stage stochastic program aimed at strategically managing existing orders while considering incoming requests that are subject to various uncertainties. A significant challenge in deploying the envisioned two-stage model lies in its incorporation of vehicle routing constraints, on which exact or brute-force methods are computationally inefficient and unsuitable for real-time operational decisions. To address this, we propose an accelerated L-shaped algorithm that (i) reduces the branching tree size, (ii) replaces exact second-stage solutions with heuristic estimates, and (iii) adapts an alternating strategy for adding optimality cuts. The proposed heuristic demonstrates remarkable performance superiority over the exact method, achieving a 20-fold reduction in average runtime while maintaining an average optimality gap of less than 1\%. We apply the algorithm to a wide range of instances to evaluate the benefits of postponing orders for batch service using the stochastic model. Our results show potential long-term cost savings of up to 20\% when demand uncertainty is explicitly considered in order fulfillment decisions. Meanwhile, the derived savings tend to diminish as the uncertainty increases in order arrivals.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Rate of Sinkhorn's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Sinkhorn's algorithm for solving the entropically regularized optimal transport problem. Its iterate $\pi_{t}$ is shown to satisfy $H(\pi_{t}|\pi_{*})+H(\pi_{*}|\pi_{t})=O(t^{-1})$ where $H$ denotes relative entropy and $\pi_{*}$ the optimal coupling. This holds for a large class of cost functions and marginals, including quadratic cost with subgaussian marginals. We also obtain the rate $O(t^{-1})$ for the dual suboptimality and $O(t^{-2})$ for the marginal entropies. More precisely, we derive non-asymptotic bounds, and in contrast to previous results on linear convergence that are limited to bounded costs, our estimates do not deteriorate exponentially with the regularization parameter. We also obtain a stability result for $\pi_{*}$ as a function of the marginals, quantified in relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Mixed Integer Optimization through Probabilistic Multi-variable Branching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Pre-trained Mixed Integer Optimization framework (PreMIO) that accelerates online mixed integer program (MIP) solving with offline datasets and machine learning models. Our method is based on a data-driven multi-variable cardinality branching procedure that splits the MIP feasible region using hyperplanes chosen by the concentration inequalities. Unlike most previous ML+MIP approaches that either require complicated implementation or suffer from a lack of theoretical justification, our method is simple, flexible, provable, and explainable. Numerical experiments on both classical OR benchmark datasets and real-life instances validate the efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>On Sinkhorn's Algorithm and Choice Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a broad class of models widely used in practice for choice and ranking data based on Luce's choice axiom, including the Bradley--Terry--Luce and Plackett--Luce models, we show that the associated maximum likelihood estimation problems are equivalent to a classic matrix balancing problem with target row and column sums. This perspective opens doors between two seemingly unrelated research areas, and allows us to unify existing algorithms in the choice modeling literature as special instances or analogs of Sinkhorn's celebrated algorithm for matrix balancing. We draw inspirations from these connections and resolve some open problems on the study of Sinkhorn's algorithm. We establish the global linear convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm for non-negative matrices whenever finite scaling matrices exist, and characterize its linear convergence rate in terms of the algebraic connectivity of a weighted bipartite graph. We further derive the sharp asymptotic rate of linear convergence, which generalizes a classic result of Knight (2008). To our knowledge, these are the first quantitative linear convergence results for Sinkhorn's algorithm for general non-negative matrices and positive marginals. Our results highlight the importance of connectivity and orthogonality structures in matrix balancing and Sinkhorn's algorithm, which could be of independent interest. More broadly, the connections we establish in this paper between matrix balancing and choice modeling could also help motivate further transmission of ideas and lead to interesting results in both disciplines.</description>

      <title>Self-triggered Stabilization of Contracting Systems under Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose self-triggered control schemes for nonlinear systems with quantized state measurements. Our focus lies on scenarios where both the controller and the self-triggering mechanism receive only the quantized state at each sampling time. We assume that the ideal closed-loop system without quantization or self-triggered sampling is contracting. Moreover, an upper bound on the growth rate of the open-loop system is assumed to be known. We present two control schemes that achieve closed-loop stability without Zeno behavior. The first scheme is implemented under logarithmic quantization and uses the quantized state for the threshold in the triggering condition. The second one is a joint design of zooming quantization and self-triggered sampling, where the adjustable zoom parameter for quantization changes based on inter-sampling times and is also used for the threshold of self-triggered sampling. In both schemes, the self-triggering mechanism predicts the future state from the quantized data for the computation of the next sampling time. We employ a trajectory-based approach for stability analysis, where contraction theory plays a key role.</description>

      <title>Achieving ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ Complexity in Hessian/Jacobian-free Stochastic Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the bilevel optimization problem, in which the upper-level objective function is generally nonconvex and the lower-level objective function is strongly convex. Although this type of problem has been studied extensively, it still remains an open question how to achieve an ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ sample complexity in Hessian/Jacobian-free stochastic bilevel optimization without any second-order derivative computation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Hessian/Jacobian-free bilevel optimizer named FdeHBO, which features a simple fully single-loop structure, a projection-aided finite-difference Hessian/Jacobian-vector approximation, and momentum-based updates. Theoretically, we show that FdeHBO requires ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ iterations (each using ${O}(1)$ samples and only first-order gradient information) to find an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary point. As far as we know, this is the first Hessian/Jacobian-free method with an ${O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ sample complexity for nonconvex-strongly-convex stochastic bilevel optimization.</description>

      <title>It's All in the Mix: Wasserstein Classification and Regression with Mixed Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problem definition: A key challenge in supervised learning is data scarcity, which can cause prediction models to overfit to the training data and perform poorly out of sample. A contemporary approach to combat overfitting is offered by distributionally robust problem formulations that consider all data-generating distributions close to the empirical distribution derived from historical samples, where 'closeness' is determined by the Wasserstein distance. While such formulations show significant promise in prediction tasks where all input features are continuous, they scale exponentially when discrete features are present. Methodology/results: We demonstrate that distributionally robust mixed-feature classification and regression problems can indeed be solved in polynomial time. Our proof relies on classical ellipsoid method-based solution schemes that do not scale well in practice. To overcome this limitation, we develop a practically efficient (yet, in the worst case, exponential time) cutting plane-based algorithm that admits a polynomial time separation oracle, despite the presence of exponentially many constraints. We compare our method against alternative techniques both theoretically and empirically on standard benchmark instances. Managerial implications: Data-driven operations management problems often involve prediction models with discrete features. We develop and analyze distributionally robust prediction models that faithfully account for the presence of discrete features, and we demonstrate that our models can significantly outperform existing methods that are agnostic to the presence of discrete features, both theoretically and on standard benchmark instances.</description>

      <title>Distributed Stochastic Bilevel Optimization: Improved Complexity and Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper consider solving a class of nonconvex-strongly-convex distributed stochastic bilevel optimization (DSBO) problems with personalized inner-level objectives. Most existing algorithms require computational loops for hypergradient estimation, leading to computational inefficiency. Moreover, the impact of data heterogeneity on convergence in bilevel problems is not explicitly characterized yet. To address these issues, we propose LoPA, a loopless personalized distributed algorithm that leverages a tracking mechanism for iterative approximation of inner-level solutions and Hessian-inverse matrices without relying on extra computation loops. Our theoretical analysis explicitly characterizes the heterogeneity across nodes (denoted by $b$), and establishes a sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}( {\frac{1}{{{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)}}K}} \!+ \!\frac{{(\frac{b}{\sqrt{m}})^{\frac{2}{3}} }}{{\left( {1 - \rho } \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} K^{\frac{2}{3}} }} \!+ \!\frac{1}{\sqrt{ K }}( {\sigma _{\operatorname{p} }} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}{\sigma _{\operatorname{c} }} ) } )$ without the boundedness of local hypergradients, where ${\sigma _{\operatorname{p} }}$ and ${\sigma _{\operatorname{c} }}$ represent the gradient sampling variances associated with the inner- and outer-level variables, respectively. We also integrate LoPA with a gradient tracking scheme to eliminate the impact of data heterogeneity, yielding an improved rate of ${{\mathcal{O}}}(\frac{{1}}{{ (1-\rho)^2K }} \!+\! \frac{1}{{\sqrt{K}}}( \sigma_{\rm{p}} \!+\! \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\sigma_{\rm{c}} ) )$. The computational complexity of LoPA is of ${{\mathcal{O}}}({\epsilon^{-2}})$ to an $\epsilon$-stationary point, matching the communication complexity due to the loopless structure, which outperforms existing counterparts for DSBO. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We study the basic properties of degenerate preconditioned resolvent based on restricted maximal monotonicity, and extend the non-expansiveness, demiclosedness and Moreau's decomposition identity to degenerate setting. Several conditions are further proposed for the well-definedness of the degenerate resolvent and weak convergence of its associated fixed point iterations within either range space or whole space. The results help to understand the behaviours of many operator splitting algorithms, especially in the kernel space of degenerate preconditioner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider several classes of highly important semidefinite optimization problems that involve both a convex objective function (smooth or nonsmooth) and additional linear or nonlinear smooth and convex constraints, which are ubiquitous in statistics, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and other domains. We focus on high-dimensional and plausible settings in which the problem admits a low-rank solution which also satisfies a low-rank complementarity condition. We provide several theoretical results proving that, under these circumstances, the well-known Extragradient method, when initialized in the proximity of an optimal primal-dual solution, converges to a solution of the constrained optimization problem with its standard convergence rates guarantees, using only low-rank singular value decompositions (SVD) to project onto the positive semidefinite cone, as opposed to computationally-prohibitive full-rank SVDs required in worst-case. Our approach is supported by numerical experiments conducted with a dataset of Max-Cut instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback optimization is an increasingly popular control paradigm to optimize dynamical systems, accounting for control objectives that concern the system operation at steady-state. Existing feedback optimization techniques heavily rely on centralized systems and controller architectures, and thus suffer from scalability and privacy issues when systems become large-scale. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture for feedback optimization inspired by distributed gradient descent, whereby each agent updates its local control variable by combining the average of its neighbors with a local negative gradient step. Under convexity and smoothness assumptions for the cost, we establish convergence of the control method to a critical optimization point. By reinforcing the assumptions to restricted strong convexity, we show that our algorithm converges linearly to a neighborhood of the optimal point, where the size of the neighborhood depends on the choice of the stepsize. Simulations corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on multi-agent stochastic differential games for jump-diffusion systems. On one hand, we study the multi-agent game for optimal investment in a jump-diffusion market. We derive constant Nash equilibria and provide sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness for exponential, power, and logarithmic utilities, respectively. On the other hand, we introduce a computational framework based on the actor-critic method in deep reinforcement learning to solve the stochastic control problem with jumps. We extend this algorithm to address the multi-agent game with jumps and utilize parallel computing to enhance computational efficiency. We present numerical examples of the Merton problem with jumps, linear quadratic regulators, and the optimal investment game under various settings to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method. In particular, neural network solutions numerically converge to the derived constant Nash equilibrium for the multi-agent game.</description>

      <title>Air-taxi trajectory optimization with aerodynamic and motor models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To fulfill the vision for large-scale urban air mobility, air-taxi concepts must be carefully designed and optimized for their intended mission. Proposed air-taxi missions contain dynamic segments that are dominated by nonlinear dynamics. One such segment is the transition to and from hover and cruise that occurs at the start and end of the mission. Because this transition involves low-altitude and high-power flight, analyzing transition trajectories is critical for safe and economical urban air mobility. Optimization of the transition maneuver requires an optimal control approach that characterizes the trajectories of the system states through time. In this paper we solve this optimal control problem for air-taxi transition within a large-scale design-optimization framework. This framework allows us to include five physics-based models that describe flight dynamics, rotor aerodynamics, wing aerodynamics, motor performance, and acoustics with which we create a low-fidelity model of NASA's Lift-plus-Cruise air-taxi concept. We use this optimization problem formulation to compute transition trajectories that minimize time or minimize energy. Our results show that the Lift-plus-Cruise aircraft completes a minimum-energy transition in 80s with an energy expenditure of 13.3MJ and a minimum-time transition in 28s with an energy expenditure of 16.4MJ. We find that these trajectories contain large pitch angles and high sound pressure levels which are both undesirable for practical urban air mobility. Consequently, we explore trajectories that include pitch angle and acoustic constraints, and find that minimum time trajectories are significantly more affected by these constraints than minimum energy trajectories.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Transshipment in Three-Sided Meal Delivery Services via Microhubs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes a novel transshipment strategy for meal delivery. In this approach, the service area is partitioned into smaller sub-areas, with deliverers assigned to operate exclusively within these sub-areas. Meanwhile, a centrally located microhub functions as a logistic depot to facilitate the batching and transfer of meal packages toward different sub-areas. We model the meal delivery system with transshipment using networked G/G/m queues and analytically approximate two critical system performance metrics -- customer waiting time and vehicle miles traveled -- to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The performance achieved by transshipment is benchmarked against that of the classic pickup-and-delivery strategy without transshipment, both predicted using continuous approximations. For the latter, we enhance the existing modeling by incorporating the delivery distance profiles of individual orders to better match the meal delivery context. Our comparisons indicate that meal delivery via transshipment outperforms the non-transshipping counterpart across both metrics under either high-demand or low-supply conditions, with particular advantages in servicing larger areas or handling long-distance orders. This conclusion is corroborated by a numerical experiment using empirical meal delivery data from Meituan, which suggests that an optimally configured transshipment strategy can significantly improve service performance for both customers and deliverers during peak lunch hours and in the busiest districts. While transshipment continues to reduce vehicle miles traveled by deliverers during non-peak hours, it results in longer customer waiting times compared to the benchmark without transshipment as demand decreases.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Order Picking in Warehouse Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order picking is a pivotal operation in warehouses that directly impacts overall efficiency and profitability. This study addresses the dynamic order picking problem, a significant concern in modern warehouse management, where real-time adaptation to fluctuating order arrivals and efficient picker routing are crucial. Traditional methods, which often depend on static optimization algorithms designed around fixed order sets for the picker routing, fall short in addressing the challenges of this dynamic environment. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework tailored for single-block warehouses equipped with an autonomous picking device. By dynamically optimizing picker routes, our approach significantly reduces order throughput times and unfulfilled orders, particularly under high order arrival rates. We benchmark our DRL model against established algorithms, utilizing instances generated based on standard practices in the order picking literature. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our DRL model over benchmark algorithms. For example, at a high order arrival rate of 0.09 (i.e., 9 orders per 100 units of time on average), our approach achieves an order fulfillment rate of approximately 98%, compared to the 82% fulfillment rate observed with benchmarking algorithms. We further investigate the integration of a hyperparameter in the reward function that allows for flexible balancing between distance traveled and order completion time. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our DRL model on out-of-sample test instances.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Mean Field Games under Heterogeneous Erroneous Initial Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, linear quadratic mean field games (LQMFGs) under heterogeneous erroneous initial information are investigated, focusing on how to achieve error correction by calculation based on the agents' own actual state and interactions in the game, rather than process observations. First, we establish a mathematic model for initial information error propagation in LQMFGs, several all-agents-known linear relationships between initial errors and deviations of agents' strategies and MF from those under correct information are given. Next, we investigate the error correction and strategy modification behavior of an agent and corresponding methods that only requires it own states. Under deterministic situation, a sufficient condition is provided for agents to compute actual MF and optimal strategies by one-time error correction, which is only related to modification time and parameters of the system. Under stochastic situation, the mathematical model of agents' real-time estimations for MF and corresponding strategies are given, and estimation error affections are analysed. Finally, simulations are performed to verify above conclusions.</description>

      <title>Spanning and Splitting: Integer Semidefinite Programming for the Quadratic Minimum Spanning Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quadratic minimum spanning tree problem (QMSTP) one wants to find the minimizer of a quadratic function over all possible spanning trees of a graph. We present a formulation of the QMSTP as a mixed-integer semidefinite program exploiting the algebraic connectivity of a graph. Based on this formulation, we derive a doubly nonnegative relaxation for the QMSTP and investigate classes of valid inequalities to strengthen the relaxation using the Chv\'atal-Gomory procedure for mixed-integer conic programming. Solving the resulting relaxations is out of reach for off-the-shelf software. We therefore develop and implement a version of the Peaceman-Rachford splitting method that allows to compute the new bounds for graphs from the literature. The computational results demonstrate that our bounds significantly improve over existing bounds from the literature in both quality and computation time, in particular for graphs with more than 30 vertices. This work is further evidence that semidefinite programming is a valuable tool to obtain high-quality bounds for problems in combinatorial optimization, in particular for those that can be modelled as a quadratic problem.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Linear Policies for Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Gaussian Regulator with Stationary Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that output-feedback linear policies remain optimal for solving the Linear Quadratic Gaussian regulation problem in the face of worst-case process and measurement noise distributions when these are independent, stationary, and known to be within a radius (in the Wasserstein sense) to some reference zero-mean Gaussian noise distributions. Additionally, we establish the existence of a Nash equilibrium of the zero-sum game between a control engineer, who minimizes control cost, and a fictitious adversary, who chooses the noise distributions that maximize this cost. For general (possibly non-Gaussian) reference noise distributions, we establish a quasi closed-form solution for the worst-case distributions for linear policies, requiring only solving two decoupled one-dimensional algebraic equations. Our work provides a less conservative alternative compared to recent work in distributionally robust control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational analysis provides the theoretical foundations and practical tools for constructing optimization algorithms without being restricted to smooth or convex problems. We survey the central concepts in the context of a concrete but broadly applicable problem class from composite optimization in finite dimensions. While prioritizing accessibility over mathematical details, we introduce subgradients of arbitrary functions and the resulting optimality conditions, describe approximations and the need for going beyond pointwise and uniform convergence, and summarize proximal methods. We derive dual problems from parametrization of the actual problem and the resulting relaxations. The paper ends with an introduction to second-order theory and its role in stability analysis of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Robust optimal stopping with regime switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal stopping problem in the presence of model uncertainty and regime switching. The max-min formulation for robust control and the dynamic programming approach are adopted to establish a general theoretical framework for such kind of problem. First, based on the dynamic programming principle, the value function of the optimal stopping problem is characterized as the unique viscosity solution to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Then, the so-called smooth-fit principle for optimal stopping problems is proved in the current context, and a verification theorem consisting of a set of sufficient conditions for robust optimality is established. Moreover, when the Markov chain has a large state space and exhibits a two-time-scale structure, a singular perturbation approach is utilized to reduce the complexity involved and obtain an asymptotically optimal solution. Finally, an example of choosing the best time to sell a stock is provided, in which numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the implications of model uncertainty and regime switching.</description>

      <title>Exact Verification of First-Order Methods via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present exact mixed-integer linear programming formulations for verifying the performance of first-order methods for parametric quadratic optimization. We formulate the verification problem as a mixed-integer linear program where the objective is to maximize the infinity norm of the fixed-point residual after a given number of iterations. Our approach captures a wide range of gradient, projection, proximal iterations through affine or piecewise affine constraints. We derive tight polyhedral convex hull formulations of the constraints representing the algorithm iterations. To improve the scalability, we develop a custom bound tightening technique combining interval propagation, operator theory, and optimization-based bound tightening. Numerical examples, including linear and quadratic programs from network optimization, sparse coding using Lasso, and optimal control, show that our method provides several orders of magnitude reductions in the worst-case fixed-point residuals, closely matching the true worst-case performance.</description>

      <title>Pareto sensitivity, most-changing sub-fronts, and knee solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dealing with a multi-objective optimization problem, obtaining a comprehensive representation of the Pareto front can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, identifying the most representative Pareto solutions can be difficult and sometimes ambiguous. A popular selection are the so-called Pareto knee solutions, where a small improvement in any objective leads to a large deterioration in at least one other objective. In this paper, using Pareto sensitivity, we show how to compute Pareto knee solutions according to their verbal definition of least maximal change. We refer to the resulting approach as the sensitivity knee (snee) approach, and we apply it to unconstrained and constrained problems. Pareto sensitivity can also be used to compute the most-changing Pareto sub-fronts around a Pareto solution, where the points are distributed along directions of maximum change, which could be of interest in a decision-making process if one is willing to explore solutions around a current one. Our approach is still restricted to scalarized methods, in particular to the weighted-sum or epsilon-constrained methods, and require the computation or approximations of first- and second-order derivatives. We include numerical results from synthetic problems that illustrate the benefits of our approach.</description>

      <title>High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under heavy-tailed noise conditions, our SSQP method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds as in the light-tailed noise setting, while further exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lur'e dynamical systems whose nonlinearity is either Lipschitz, incrementally sector bounded, or monotone. We consider both the discrete- and continuous-time settings. In each case, we provide state-independent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which are necessary and sufficient for contractivity. Additionally, we provide LMIs for the design of controller gains such that the closed-loop system is contracting. Finally, we provide a numerical example for control design.</description>

      <title>Shannon-and von neumann-entropy regularizations of linear and semidefinite programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the LP in standard form min {c T x\,: Ax = b; x $\ge$ 0} and inspired by $\epsilon$-regularization in Optimal Transport, we introduce its $\epsilon$-regularization ''min {c T x + $\epsilon$ f (x)\,: Ax = b; x $\ge$ 0}'' via the (convex) Boltzmann-Shannon entropy f (x)\,:= i x i ln x i . We also provide a similar regularization for the semidefinite program ''min {Tr(C $\bullet$ X)\,: A(X) = b; X 0}'' but with now the so-called Von Neumann entropy, as in Quantum Optimal Transport. Importantly, both are not barriers of the LP and SDP cones respectively. We show that this problem admits an equivalent unconstrained convex problem max $\lambda$$\in$R m G$\epsilon$($\lambda$) for an explicit concave differentiable function G$\epsilon$ in dual variables $\lambda$ $\in$ R m . As $\epsilon$ goes to zero, its optimal value converges to the optimal value of the initial LP. While it resembles the log-barrier formulation of interior point algorithm for the initial LP, it has a distinguishing advantage. Namely for fixed $\lambda$, G$\epsilon$($\lambda$) is obtained as a minimization over the whole space x $\in$ R d (and not over x $\ge$ 0) to still obtain a nonnegative solution x($\lambda$) $\ge$ 0, whence an explicit form of G$\epsilon$ very useful for its unconstrained maximization over R m .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor canonical correlation analysis (TCCA) has received significant attention due to its ability to effectively preserve the geometric structure of high-order data. However, existing methods generally rely on tensor decomposition techniques with high computational complexity, which severely limits their application in large-scale datasets. In this paper, a modified method, TCCA-L, is proposed, which integrates sparse regularization and Laplacian regularization. An alternating manifold proximal gradient algorithm is designed based on Riemannian manifold theory. The algorithm avoids the traditional tensor decomposition and combines with the semi-smooth Newton algorithm to solve the subproblem, thus significantly improving the computational efficiency. Furthermore, the global convergence of the sequence generated by the algorithm is established, providing a solid theoretical foundation for its convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TCCA-L outperforms traditional methods in both classification accuracy and running time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.04007v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Subspace Power Method (SPM) for calculating the CP decomposition of low-rank real symmetric tensors. This algorithm calculates one new CP component at a time, alternating between applying the shifted symmetric higher-order power method (SS-HOPM) to a certain modified tensor, constructed from a matrix flattening of the original tensor; and using appropriate deflation steps. We obtain rigorous guarantees for SPM regarding convergence and global optima for input tensors of dimension $d$ and order $m$ of CP rank up to $O(d^{\lfloor m/2\rfloor})$, via results in classical algebraic geometry and optimization theory. As a by-product of our analysis we prove that SS-HOPM converges unconditionally, settling a conjecture in [Kolda, T.G., Mayo, J.R.: Shifted power method for computing tensor eigenpairs. SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications 32(4), 1095-1124 (2011)]. We present numerical experiments which demonstrate that SPM is efficient and robust to noise, being up to one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CP decomposition algorithms in certain experiments. Furthermore, prior knowledge of the CP rank is not required by SPM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a versatile approach capable of accommodating diverse control requirements that holds significant promise for a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Noteworthy challenges associated with MPC include the substantial computational burden, which is sometimes considered excessive even for linear systems. Recently, a rapid computation method that guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing primal-dual gradient (PDG) dynamics as a controller has been proposed for linear MPCs. However, stability has been ensured under the assumption that the controller is a continuous-time system, leading to potential instability when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller, incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach, and present stability conditions relevant to the resulting sampled-data system. Additionally, we introduce an extension designed to enhance control performance, that was traded off in the original. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method, which can be executed in only 1 $\mu$s in a standard laptop, not only ensures stability with considering sampled-data implementation but also effectively enhances control performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite, simple, connected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=n$, we consider the associated graph Laplacian matrix $L = D - A$ with eigenvalues $0 = \lambda_1 &lt; \lambda_2 \leq \dots \leq \lambda_n$. One can also consider the same graph equipped with positive edge weights $w:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0}$ normalized to $\sum_{e \in E} w_e = |E|$ and the associated weighted Laplacian matrix $L_w$. We say that $G$ is conformally rigid if constant edge-weights maximize the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(w)$ of $L_w$ over all $w$, and minimize $\lambda_n(w')$ of $L_{w'}$ over all $w'$, i.e., for all $w,w'$, $$ \lambda_2(w) \leq \lambda_2(1) \leq \lambda_n(1) \leq \lambda_n(w').$$ Conformal rigidity requires an extraordinary amount of symmetry in $G$. Every edge-transitive graph is conformally rigid. We prove that every distance-regular graph, and hence every strongly-regular graph, is conformally rigid. Certain special graph embeddings can be used to characterize conformal rigidity. Cayley graphs can be conformally rigid but need not be, we prove a sufficient criterion. We also find a small set of conformally rigid graphs that do not belong into any of the above categories; these include the Hoffman graph, the crossing number graph 6B and others. Conformal rigidity can be certified via semidefinite programming, we provide explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Risk-Sensitive Policy Gradient: An Iteration Complexity Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown exceptional performance across various applications, enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with their environments. However, traditional RL frameworks often face challenges in terms of iteration efficiency and robustness. Risk-sensitive policy gradient methods, which incorporate both expected return and risk measures, have been explored for their ability to yield more robust policies, yet their iteration complexity remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a rigorous iteration complexity analysis for the risk-sensitive policy gradient method, focusing on the REINFORCE algorithm with an exponential utility function. We establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP). Furthermore, we investigate whether risk-sensitive algorithms can achieve better iteration complexity compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. Our analysis indicates that risk-sensitive REINFORCE can potentially converge faster. To validate our analysis, we empirically evaluate the learning performance and convergence efficiency of the risk-neutral and risk-sensitive REINFORCE algorithms in multiple environments: CartPole, MiniGrid, and Robot Navigation.

      <title>Collaborative Pareto Set Learning in Multiple Multi-Objective Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is an emerging research area in multi-objective optimization, focusing on training neural networks to learn the mapping from preference vectors to Pareto optimal solutions. However, existing PSL methods are limited to addressing a single Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) at a time. When faced with multiple MOPs, this limitation results in significant inefficiencies and hinders the ability to exploit potential synergies across varying MOPs. In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Pareto Set Learning (CoPSL) framework, which learns the Pareto sets of multiple MOPs simultaneously in a collaborative manner. CoPSL particularly employs an architecture consisting of shared and MOP-specific layers. The shared layers are designed to capture commonalities among MOPs collaboratively, while the MOP-specific layers tailor these general insights to generate solution sets for individual MOPs. This collaborative approach enables CoPSL to efficiently learn the Pareto sets of multiple MOPs in a single execution while leveraging the potential relationships among various MOPs. To further understand these relationships, we experimentally demonstrate that shareable representations exist among MOPs. Leveraging these shared representations effectively improves the capability to approximate Pareto sets. Extensive experiments underscore the superior efficiency and robustness of CoPSL in approximating Pareto sets compared to state-of-the-art approaches on a variety of synthetic and real-world MOPs.

      <title>Near-Optimal Policy Identification in Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes via Epigraph Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16286v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a safe policy for uncertain environments is crucial in real-world control systems. However, this challenge remains inadequately addressed within the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. This paper presents the first algorithm guaranteed to identify a near-optimal policy in a robust constrained MDP (RCMDP), where an optimal policy minimizes cumulative cost while satisfying constraints in the worst-case scenario across a set of environments. We first prove that the conventional policy gradient approach to the Lagrangian max-min formulation can become trapped in suboptimal solutions. This occurs when its inner minimization encounters a sum of conflicting gradients from the objective and constraint functions. To address this, we leverage the epigraph form of the RCMDP problem, which resolves the conflict by selecting a single gradient from either the objective or the constraints. Building on the epigraph form, we propose a bisection search algorithm with a policy gradient subroutine and prove that it identifies an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an RCMDP with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ robust policy evaluations.</description>

      <title>Parallel Batch Scheduling With Incompatible Job Families Via Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. The state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP) model for this problem relies on specific functions and global constraints only available in a well established commercial CP solver. This paper expands the literature around this problem by proposing four new CP models that can be implemented in commercial and open-source solvers: a new model that relies on automaton constraints, and three alternative models that integrate assignment and scheduling decisions with different strategies and global constraints. Extensive computational experiments on standard test cases under multiple objectives and multiple solvers demonstrate the implementation flexibility and competitive performance of the proposed models.</description>

      <title>Safety Filter for Robust Disturbance Rejection via Online Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disturbance rejection in high-precision control applications can be significantly improved upon via online convex optimization (OCO). This includes classical techniques such as recursive least squares (RLS) and more recent, regret-based formulations. However, these methods can cause instabilities in the presence of model uncertainty. This paper introduces a safety filter for systems with OCO in the form of adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filtering to ensure robust disturbance rejection. The safety filter enforces a robust stability constraint on the FIR coefficients while minimally altering the OCO command in the $\infty$-norm cost. Additionally, we show that the induced $\ell_\infty$-norm allows for easy online implementation of the safety filter by directly limiting the OCO command. The constraint can be tuned to trade off robustness and performance. We provide a simple example to demonstrate the safety filter.</description>

      <title>Process and Policy Insights from an Intercomparison of Open Electricity System Capacity Expansion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study performs a detailed intercomparison of four open-source electricity capacity expansion models - Temoa, Switch, GenX, and USENSYS - to evaluate 1) how closely the results of these models align when inputs and configurations are harmonized, and 2) the degree to which varying model configurations affect outputs. We harmonize the inputs to each model using PowerGenome and use clearly defined scenarios (policy conditions) and configurations (model setup choices). This allows us to isolate how differences in model structure affect policy outcomes and investment decisions. Our framework allows each model to be tested on identical assumptions for policy, technology costs, and operational constraints, allowing us to focus on differences that arise from inherent model structures. Key findings highlight that, when harmonized, models produce very similar capacity portfolios under current policies and net-zero scenarios, with less than 1% difference in system costs for most configurations. This agreement among models allows us to focus on how configuration choices affect model results. For instance, configurations with unit commitment constraints or economic retirement yield different investments and system costs compared to simpler configurations. Our findings underscore the importance of aligning input data and transparently defining scenarios and configurations to provide robust policy insights.</description>

      <title>A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of non-linear programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. In order to enhance the robustness and reduce the computational burden, this paper proposes a two-layer trajectory generating algorithm for intelligent ground vehicles with convex optimization methods, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization and to improve the calculate speed of motion prediction. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets constructed by some customized search algorithms incrementally. We rigorously establish these advantages through mathematical analysis under moderate assumptions and comprehensive experimental validations. For linear vehicle models, comparative experiments with general sequential convex programming algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational efficiency in dynamic maps and the reduced final time.</description>
