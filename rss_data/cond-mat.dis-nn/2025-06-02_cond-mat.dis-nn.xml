      <title>Density of states correlations in L\'evy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied global density-of-states correlation function $R(\omega)$ for L\'evy-Rosenzveig-Porter random matrix ensemble~\cite{BirTar_Levy-RP} in the non-ergodic extended phase. Using extension of Efetov's supersymmetry approach ~\cite{MirFyod_non_Gauss} we calculated $R(\omega)$ exactly in all relevant ranges of $\omega$. At relatively low $\omega \leq \Gamma$\, (with $\Gamma \gg \Delta$ being effective mini-band width) we found GUE-type oscillations with period of level spacing $\Delta$, decaying exponentially at the Thouless energy scale $E_{Th} = \sqrt{\Delta \Gamma/2\pi}$. At high energies $\omega \gg E_{Th}$ our results coincide with those obtained in Ref.~\cite{lunkin2024localdensitystatescorrelations} via cavity equation approach. Inverse of the effective mini-band width $1/\Gamma$ is shown to be given by the average of the local decay times over L\'evy distribution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical detection of extended nonergodic states in many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal dimensions are tools for probing the structure of quantum states and identifying whether they are localized or delocalized in a given basis. These quantities are commonly extracted through finite-size scaling, which limits the analysis to relatively small system sizes. In this work, we demonstrate that the correlation fractal dimension $D_2$ can be directly obtained from the long-time dynamics of interacting many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we show that it coincides with the exponent of the power-law decay of the time-averaged survival probability, defined as the fidelity between an initial state and its time-evolved counterpart. This dynamical approach avoids the need for scaling procedures and enables access to larger systems than those typically reachable via exact diagonalization. We test the method on various random matrix ensembles, including full random matrices, the Rosenzweig-Porter model, and power-law banded random matrices, and extend the analysis to interacting many-body systems described by the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model and the disordered spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain. In the case of full random matrices, we also derive an analytical expression for the entire evolution of the time-averaged survival probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975, two papers were published that together sparked major new directions, conceptual, mathematical and practically applicable, in several previously disparate fields of science. In this short review, we expose key aspects of their thinking, implementations and implications, along with a selection of further crucial and consequential developments. These papers were `Theory of spin glasses' by S.F.Edwards and P.W.Anderson (EA)[1] and `Solvable Model of a Spin-Glass', by D.Sherrington and S.Kirkpatrick (SK)[2], both concerned with trying to understand recent experiments that suggested a new phase of matter.</description>

      <title>Frustrated vacancy ordering creates novel quantum properties in Kutinaite, $\mathrm{Ag}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{14.4}\mathrm{As}_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ideal crystals are fully ordered, but real-world crystals always contain defects breaking translational symmetry. Random defects in crystals have important implications and they e.g. provide the foundation for semiconductor-based electronic devices. Structurally correlated defects introduce an additional level of complexity, which may lead to novel materials properties, but rationalization of relations between correlated disorder and the emergent material properties are very rare. Here we report that the defect structure of the mineral Kutinaite, Ag6Cu14.4As7, exhibits unprecedented metallic diamagnetism, a hallmark of non-trivial electronic states that require delicate symmetrical protection. Using a combination of X-ray scattering methodologies, simulations, and physical property measurements, we deduced and verified subtle frustrated vacancy ordering of the Cu sublattice when cooling crystals below ~300 K. The vacancy frustration in Kutinaite leads to unique quantum properties, and our study calls for a reconsideration of the role of vacancies as quasi-chemical species in crystals.</description>

      <title>Finite-time scaling on low-dimensional map bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has introduced the concept of finite-time scaling to characterize bifurcation diagrams at finite times in deterministic discrete dynamical systems, drawing an analogy with finite-size scaling used to study critical behavior in finite systems. In this work, we extend the finite-time scaling approach in several key directions. First, we present numerical results for 1D maps exhibiting period-doubling bifurcations and discontinuous transitions, analyzing selected paradigmatic examples. We then define two observables, the finite-time susceptibility and the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, that also display consistent scaling near bifurcation points. The method is further generalized to special cases of 2D maps including the 2D Chialvo map, capturing its bifurcation between a fixed point and a periodic orbit, while accounting for discontinuities and asymmetric periodic orbits. These results underscore fundamental connections between temporal and spatial observables in complex systems, suggesting new avenues for studying complex dynamical behavior.</description>

      <title>Correlated emission of electron-current waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated emission of light offer a potential avenue for entanglement generation between atomic spins, with potential application for sensing and quantum memory. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the correlated emission by color centers into an electronic bath of conduction electrons. Unlike emission into bosonic modes, electrons can absorb energy via two-particle processes across a large range of length scales. We find that two length scales are particularly relevant: one set by the Fermi velocity and the frequency of the color centers $v_F/\Delta$, and the other set by the Fermi wavelength $\lambda_F \ll v_F/\Delta$. Subradiance requires emitters to be spaced at a distance closer than the Fermi wavelength, while superradiance requires spacing less than $\sqrt{\lambda_F v_F/\Delta}$, so long as the emitters are initialized with coherence. We show that the emitted current burst has a spiral form, and we discuss the experimental possibility to observe correlated dissipation by color-center qubits coupled to electronic environments.</description>

      <title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While the right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks, an exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through vanilla transformer blocks with self-attention layers, layer normalisation, skip connections and ReLU MLP. To treat the self-attention layer, we draw on a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We identify and characterise two regimes governed by the variance of the query and key initialisations: a low-variance regime, where we recover the known rank collapse behaviour; and a previously unexplored high-variance regime, where signal is preserved but \textit{entropy collapse} occurs. In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the residual connection to ensure signal propagation. Our theory yields trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. Experiments with BERT-style models trained on TinyStories validate our predictions. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantees smooth training.</description>

      <title>Generalization Dynamics of Linear Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models trained on finite datasets with $N$ samples from a target distribution exhibit a transition from memorisation, where the model reproduces training examples, to generalisation, where it produces novel samples that reflect the underlying data distribution. Understanding this transition is key to characterising the sample efficiency and reliability of generative models, but our theoretical understanding of this transition is incomplete. Here, we analytically study the memorisation-to-generalisation transition in a simple model using linear denoisers, which allow explicit computation of test errors, sampling distributions, and Kullback-Leibler divergences between samples and target distribution. Using these measures, we predict that this transition occurs roughly when $N \asymp d$, the dimension of the inputs. When $N$ is smaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of relevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we demonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent overfitting. For $N &gt; d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalisation in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models and provides insight into the training dynamics of linear denoisers.</description>

      <title>Critical demand in a stochastic model of flows in supply networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supply networks are essential for modern production, yet their critical properties remain understudied. We present a stochastic model with random production capacities to analyze material flow to a root node, focusing on topology and buffer stocks. The critical demand, where unsatisfied demand diverges, is examined mostly through numerical simulations. Without stocks, minimal production dictates behavior, making topology irrelevant. With stocks, memory effects arise, making topology crucial. Increased local connectivity is beneficial: firms should favor broad, short supply chains over long, narrow ones.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of extensive-width Bayesian neural networks near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g., perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms, possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</description>
