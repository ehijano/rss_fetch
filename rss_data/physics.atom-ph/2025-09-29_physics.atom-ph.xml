      <title>Observation of resonant monopole-dipole energy transfer between Rydberg atoms and polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant energy transfer (RET), between equal parity 1s65s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ and 1s66s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ Rydberg levels in helium has been observed in low-temperature ($\sim80$ mK) collisions with ammonia molecules which undergo inversion transitions in their X$^1$A$_1$ ground electronic state. This hybrid Rydberg-atom polar-molecule RET represents a monopole-dipole energy exchange reaction that necessarily requires spatial overlap of the Rydberg-electron and molecular wavefunctions. Calculations, explicitly accounting for the charge-dipole interaction between the Rydberg electron and the molecular dipole, provide a quantitative explanation of the observations. Total parity is conserved in the reaction through the mixing of collisional angular momentum in the atom-molecule complex. This work opens opportunities to expand the toolbox of hybrid neutral-atom polar-molecule platforms for quantum science with charge-dipole mediated energy exchange.</description>

      <title>Microfabricated multi-axis cell for integrated atomic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfabricated alkali vapor cells enable the miniaturization of atomic sensors, but require collective wafer-level integration of complex features. In many applications, including magnetometers, gyroscopes, magneto-optical traps, and fluorescence imaging, multiple optical accesses are needed to enhance performance. Yet, achieving this without compromising manufacturability remains challenging. In this work, we present a wafer-level fabrication approach that enables three orthogonal optical pathways in microfabricated alkali vapor cells, using fully scalable and collective processes. Our method relies on the thermal reflow of glass preforms, shaped by laser-assisted etching (LAE) and bonded between silicon frames. The relatively low surface roughness produced by LAE allows effective reflow, which further smooths the surfaces without significantly compromising the optical planarity of the windows. This process results in multi-axis vapor cells featuring embedded, optics-grade lateral windows. We evaluate the device performance through both single-beam and dual-beam atomic magnetometry measurements. Magnetic sensitivities better than 200 fT/sqrt(Hz) are demonstrated along each of the three orthogonal axes, confirming the potential of the approach for tri-axis magnetic field sensing at sub-picotesla resolution. This fabrication strategy opens new perspectives for versatile, high-performance atomic sensors, fully compatible with wafer-level integration and mass production.</description>

      <title>A high-stability optical clock based on a continuously ground-state cooled Al$^+$ ion without compromising its accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single ion optical clocks have shown systematic frequency uncertainties below $10^{-18}$, but typically require more than one week of averaging to achieve a corresponding statistical uncertainty. This time can be reduced with longer probe times, but comes at the cost of a higher time-dilation shift due to motional heating of the ions in the trap. We show that sympathetic ground-state cooling using electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) of an \Al clock ion via a co-trapped \Ca ion during clock interrogation suppresses the heating of the ions. \Al can be kept close to the motional ground state, independent from the chosen interrogation time, at a relative time dilation shift of $(-1.69\pm0.20)\times10^{-18}$. The \Ca cooling light introduces an additional light shift on the \Al clock transition of $(-9.27\pm 1.03)\times10^{-18}$. We project that the uncertainty of this light shift can be further reduced by nearly an order of magnitude. This sympathetic cooling enables seconds of interrogation time with $10^{-19}$ motional and cooling laser-induced uncertainties for \Al and can be employed in other ion clocks as well.</description>

      <title>A Source of Deterministic Entanglement for Matter-Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a deterministic and experimentally feasible protocol for generating entangled pairs of ultracold neutral atoms through controlled dissociation of diatomic Feshbach molecules. The dissociation process naturally produces nonlocal quantum correlations in spin, position-momentum, and path degrees of freedom, enabling the deterministic preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of massive particles and multiqubit states through hyperentangled encoding. Having each atom of the pair prepared in a matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control, single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable with current technology. The proposed architecture naturally integrates with atomtronics circuits and chip-based matter-wave optics, offering a deterministic entanglement source for quantum nonlocality tests, precision metrology, and scalable neutral-atom quantum processors.</description>

      <title>50 mm $\times$ 50 mm Cesium Atomic Vapor Cell for Terahertz Imaging: Implementation and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors offer transformative potential for high-speed, high-sensitivity terahertz (THz) imaging. However, previous systems are hindered by restricted imaging areas, largely due to the compact dimension of atomic vapor cells and inefficient beam-shaping methodologies. We present a THz imaging system with a 50 mm $\times$ 50 mm area, enabled by a custom-engineered scaled-up atomic vapor cell and an optimized beam-shaping optical architecture. Experimental validation confirms that this system achieves near-diffraction-limited, high resolution THz imaging at 0.55 THz under ambient conditions. Furthermore, its capabilities are demonstrated through real-time visualization of the diffusion dynamics of a deionized water droplet in anhydrous ethanol. This work not only expands the boundaries of Rydberg atomic sensors but also establishes a critical foundation for advancing THz imaging technologies toward into real-world, large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Probing high-frequency gravitational waves with entangled vibrational qubits in linear Paul traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of linear Paul traps as quantum sensors for detecting megahertz gravitational waves. Single-ion configurations exploit graviton-photon conversion in the presence of external magnetic fields, while two-ion systems use relative-motion excitations, which do not require magnets, to distinguish gravitational waves from axion dark matter. Furthermore, we show that entanglement of $N$ vibrational qubits enhances the signal probability by a factor of $N^2$, improving sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Circular RABBITT goes under threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce circular under-threshold RABBITT (cuRABBITT) as a new interferometric method to probe discrete electronic excitations in atoms with attosecond resolution. By combining circularly polarized attosecond pulses with broadband (``rainbow'') spectral analysis, we directly access two-photon ionization amplitudes and their relative phases. Time-dependent Schr\"odinger simulations, supported by Green's function theory, reveal strong resonances in helium and argon and a Cooper-like minimum in xenon. These results demonstrate that cuRABBITT provides continuous spectral mapping of bound-state resonances and extends Fano's propensity rule into the under-threshold regime. Our work establishes cuRABBITT as a powerful attosecond metrology technique, opening the way to polarization-resolved studies of resonant dynamics in atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. For example, the combination of $V$-type level structure and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, making the neutral atomic excitations behave like charged particles in a magnetic field. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems (and arrays in general) focuses on the single-excitation regime. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the harmful divergences near the light cone can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</description>

      <title>Formation of ultracold $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of an ultracold gas of bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules. We first demonstrate a cooling strategy relying on sympathetic cooling of $^{133}$Cs to produce an ultracold mixture. From this mixture, weakly bound molecules are formed using a Feshbach resonance at 361.7 G. The molecular gas contains $7.6(10)\times 10^3$ molecules with a lifetime of about 130 ms, limited by two-body decay. We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved K-Cs interaction potentials. This provides a good starting point for the creation of ultracold samples of ground-state $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules.</description>
