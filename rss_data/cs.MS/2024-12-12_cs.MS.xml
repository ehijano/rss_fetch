      <title>GeoFlood: Computational model for overland flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlood, a new open-source software package for solving shallow water equations (SWE) on a quadtree hierarchy of mapped, logically Cartesian grids managed by the parallel, adaptive library ForestClaw (Calhoun and Burstedde, 2017). The GeoFlood model is validated using standard benchmark tests from Neelz and Pender (2013) and against George (2011) results obtained from the GeoClaw software (Clawpack Development Team, 2020) for the historical Malpasset dam failure problem. The benchmark test results are compared against GeoClaw and software package HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center - River Analysis System, Army Corp of Engineers) results (Brunner, 2018). This comparison demonstrates the capability of GeoFlood to accurately and efficiently predict flood wave propagation on complex terrain. The results from comparisons with the Malpasset dam break show good agreement with the GeoClaw results and are consistent with the historical records of the event.</description>

      <title>Direct Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction on GPU using Out-Of-Core: Precision and Quality Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic methods applied to the reconstruction of Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) can provide both a high image quality and a decrease in the dose received by patients, although with an increased reconstruction time since their computational costs are higher. In our work, we present a new algebraic implementation that obtains an exact solution to the system of linear equations that models the problem and based on single-precision floating-point arithmetic. By applying Out-Of-Core (OOC) techniques, the dimensions of the system can be increased regardless of the main memory size and as long as there is enough secondary storage (disk). These techniques have allowed to process images of 768 x 768 pixels. A comparative study of our method on a GPU using both single-precision and double-precision arithmetic has been carried out. The goal is to assess the single-precision arithmetic implementation both in terms of time improvement and quality of the reconstructed images to determine if it is sufficient to consider it a viable option. Results using single-precision arithmetic approximately halves the reconstruction time of the double-precision implementation, whereas the obtained images retain all internal structures despite having higher noise levels.</description>
