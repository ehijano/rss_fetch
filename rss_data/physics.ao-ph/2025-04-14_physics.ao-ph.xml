      <title>A physics informed neural network approach to simulating ice dynamics governed by the shallow ice approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we develop a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach to simulate ice sheet dynamics governed by the Shallow Ice Approximation. This problem takes the form of a time-dependent parabolic obstacle problem. Prior work has used this approach to address the stationary obstacle problem and here we extend it to the time dependent problem. Through comprehensive 1D and 2D simulations, we validate the model's effectiveness in capturing complex free-boundary conditions. By merging traditional mathematical modeling with cutting-edge deep learning methods, this approach provides a scalable and robust solution for predicting temporal variations in ice thickness. To illustrate this approach in a real world setting, we simulate the dynamics of the Devon Ice Cap, incorporating aerogeophysical data from 2000 and 2018.</description>

      <title>OTCliM: generating a near-surface climatology of optical turbulence strength ($C_n^2$) using gradient boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces OTCliM (Optical Turbulence Climatology using Machine learning), a novel approach for deriving comprehensive climatologies of atmospheric optical turbulence strength ($C_n^2$) using gradient boosting machines. OTCliM addresses the challenge of efficiently obtaining reliable site-specific $C_n^2$ climatologies near the surface, crucial for ground-based astronomy and free-space optical communication. Using gradient boosting machines and global reanalysis data, OTCliM extrapolates one year of measured $C_n^2$ into a multi-year time series. We assess OTCliM's performance using $C_n^2$ data from 17 diverse stations in New York State, evaluating temporal extrapolation capabilities and geographical generalization. Our results demonstrate accurate predictions of four held-out years of $C_n^2$ across various sites, including complex urban environments, outperforming traditional analytical models. Non-urban models also show good geographical generalization compared to urban models, which capture non-general site-specific dependencies. A feature importance analysis confirms the physical consistency of the trained models. It also indicates the potential to uncover new insights into the physical processes governing $C_n^2$ from data. OTCliM's ability to derive reliable $C_n^2$ climatologies from just one year of observations can potentially reduce resources required for future site surveys or enable studies for additional sites with the same resources.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism-Learning Deeply Coupled Model for Remote Sensing Retrieval of Global Land Surface Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from remote sensing data is pivotal for analyzing climate processes and surface energy budgets. However, LST retrieval is an ill-posed inverse problem, which becomes particularly severe when only a single band is available. In this paper, we propose a deeply coupled framework integrating mechanistic modeling and machine learning to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of single-channel LST retrieval. Training samples are generated using a physically-based radiative transfer model and a global collection of 5810 atmospheric profiles. A physics-informed machine learning framework is proposed to systematically incorporate the first principles from classical physical inversion models into the learning workflow, with optimization constrained by radiative transfer equations. Global validation demonstrated a 30% reduction in root-mean-square error versus standalone methods. Under extreme humidity, the mean absolute error decreased from 4.87 K to 2.29 K (53% improvement). Continental-scale tests across five continents confirmed the superior generalizability of this model.</description>

      <title>From Winter Storm Thermodynamics to Wind Gust Extremes: Discovering Interpretable Equations from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably identifying and understanding temporal precursors to extreme wind gusts is crucial for early warning and mitigation. This study proposes a simple data-driven approach to extract key predictors from a dataset of historical extreme European winter windstorms and derive simple equations linking these precursors to extreme gusts over land. A major challenge is the limited training data for extreme events, increasing the risk of model overfitting. Testing various mitigation strategies, we find that combining dimensionality reduction, careful cross-validation, feature selection, and a nonlinear transformation of maximum wind gusts informed by Generalized Extreme Value distributions successfully reduces overfitting. These measures yield interpretable equations that generalize across regions while maintaining satisfactory predictive skill. The discovered equations reveal the association between a steady drying low-troposphere before landfall and wind gust intensity in Northwestern Europe.</description>

      <title>LUCIE: A Lightweight Uncoupled ClImate Emulator with long-term stability and physical consistency for O(1000)-member ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lightweight, easy-to-train, low-resolution, fully data-driven climate emulator, LUCIE, that can be trained on as low as $2$ years of $6$-hourly ERA5 data. Unlike most state-of-the-art AI weather models, LUCIE remains stable and physically consistent for $100$ years of autoregressive simulation with $100$ ensemble members. Long-term mean climatology from LUCIE's simulation of temperature, wind, precipitation, and humidity matches that of ERA5 data, along with the variability. We further demonstrate how well extreme weather events and their return periods can be estimated from a large ensemble of long-term simulations. We further discuss an improved training strategy with a hard-constrained first-order integrator to suppress autoregressive error growth, a novel spectral regularization strategy to better capture fine-scale dynamics, and finally an optimization algorithm that enables data-limited (as low as $2$ years of $6$-hourly data) training of the emulator without losing stability and physical consistency. Finally, we provide a scaling experiment to compare the long-term bias of LUCIE with respect to the number of training samples. Importantly, LUCIE is an easy to use model that can be trained in just $2.4$h on a single A-100 GPU, allowing for multiple experiments that can explore important scientific questions that could be answered with large ensembles of long-term simulations, e.g., the impact of different variables on the simulation, dynamic response to external forcing, and estimation of extreme weather events, amongst others.</description>
