      <title>A Cloud-Edge Framework for Energy-Efficient Event-Driven Control: An Integration of Online Supervised Learning, Spiking Neural Networks and Local Plasticity Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel cloud-edge framework for addressing computational and energy constraints in complex control systems. Our approach centers around a learning-based controller using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) on physical plants. By integrating a biologically plausible learning method with local plasticity rules, we harness the efficiency, scalability, and low latency of SNNs. This design replicates control signals from a cloud-based controller directly on the plant, reducing the need for constant plant-cloud communication. The plant updates weights only when errors surpass predefined thresholds, ensuring efficiency and robustness in various conditions. Applied to linear workbench systems and satellite rendezvous scenarios, including obstacle avoidance, our architecture dramatically lowers normalized tracking error by 96% with increased network size. The event-driven nature of SNNs minimizes energy consumption, utilizing only about 111 nJ (0.3% of conventional computing requirements). The results demonstrate the system's adjustment to changing work environments and its efficient use of computational and energy resources, with a moderate increase in energy consumption of 27.2% and 37% for static and dynamic obstacles, respectively, compared to non-obstacle scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stable Distributed Online Feedback Optimization for Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distributed voltage regulation problem in distribution systems employing online feedback optimization and short-range communication between physical neighbours. We show that a two-metric approach can be unstable. As a remedy, we propose a nested feedback optimization strategy. Simulation results reveal that while the two-metric approach fails to regulate voltages, the proposed approach achieves even less voltage limit violations than its centralized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Low-cost sensors and circuits for plasma education: characterizing power and illuminance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial applications of plasma have significantly increased beyond semiconductor manufacturing in recent years. This necessitates training a skilled workforce in plasma science and technology. However, an essential challenge to this end stems from the high cost of plasma devices and diagnostics. The limited access to plasma devices has hindered plasma education, particularly in the least developed countries. To this end, this paper demonstrates how low-cost sensors and circuits can be developed to enable inexpensive plasma experiments in laboratory environments. In particular, we show how to measure high voltage, current, and power from a cold-atmospheric plasma discharge. Additionally, we develop a low-cost illuminance sensor and demonstrate how it can be used to estimate the corresponding plasma power. The low-cost sensors and electronics presented in this paper can aid educators in characterizing plasma power versus plasma illuminance.</description>

      <title>Incremental Volt/Var Control for Distribution Networks via Chance-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an incremental Volt/Var control scheme for distribution systems with high integration of inverter-interfaced distributed generation (such as photovoltaic systems). The incremental Volt/Var controller is implemented with the objective of minimizing reactive power usage while maintaining voltages within safe limits sufficiently often. To this end, the parameters of the incremental Volt/Var controller are obtained by solving a chance-constrained optimization problem, where constraints are designed to ensure that voltage violations do not occur more often than a pre-specified probability. This approach leads to cost savings in a controlled, predictable way, while still avoiding significant over- or under-voltage issues. The proposed chance-constrained problem is solved using a successive convex approximation method. Once the gains are broadcast to the inverters, no additional communication is required since the controller is implemented locally at the inverters. The proposed method is successfully tested on a low-voltage 42-nodes network.</description>

      <title>A Robust Data-Driven Iterative Control Method for Linear Systems with Bounded Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new robust data-driven control method for linear systems with bounded disturbances, where the system model and disturbances are unknown. Due to disturbances, accurately determining the true system becomes challenging using the collected dataset. Therefore, instead of designing controllers directly for the unknown true system, an available approach is to design controllers for all systems compatible with the dataset. To overcome the limitations of using a single dataset and benefit from collecting more data, multiple datasets are employed in this paper. Furthermore, a new iterative method is developed to address the challenges of using multiple datasets. Based on this method, this paper develops an offline and online robust data-driven iterative control method, respectively. Compared to the existing robust data-driven controller method, both proposed control methods iteratively utilize multiple datasets in the controller design process. This allows for the incorporation of numerous datasets, potentially reducing the conservativeness of the designed controller. Particularly, the online controller is iteratively designed by continuously incorporating online collected data into the historical data to construct new datasets. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using a batch reactor.</description>

      <title>Risk Assessment for Nonlinear Cyber-Physical Systems under Stealth Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stealth attacks pose potential risks to cyber-physical systems because they are difficult to detect. Assessing the risk of systems under stealth attacks remains an open challenge, especially in nonlinear systems. To comprehensively quantify these risks, we propose a framework that considers both the reachability of a system and the risk distribution of a scenario. We propose an algorithm to approximate the reachability of a nonlinear system under stealth attacks with a union of standard sets. Meanwhile, we present a method to construct a risk field to formally describe the risk distribution in a given scenario. The intersection relationships of system reachability and risk regions in the risk field indicate that attackers can cause corresponding risks without being detected. Based on this, we introduce a metric to dynamically quantify the risk. Compared to traditional methods, our framework predicts the risk value in an explainable way and provides early warnings for safety control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study of an automated warehouse.</description>

      <title>Does Optimal Control Always Benefit from Better Prediction? An Analysis Framework for Predictive Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``prediction + optimal control'' scheme has shown good performance in many applications of automotive, traffic, robot, and building control. In practice, the prediction results are simply considered correct in the optimal control design process. However, in reality, these predictions may never be perfect. Under a conventional stochastic optimal control formulation, it is difficult to answer questions like ``what if the predictions are wrong''. This paper presents an analysis framework for predictive optimal control where the subjective belief about the future is no longer considered perfect. A novel concept called the hidden prediction state is proposed to establish connections among the predictors, the subjective beliefs, the control policies and the objective control performance. Based on this framework, the predictor evaluation problem is analyzed. Three commonly-used predictor evaluation measures, including the mean squared error, the regret and the log-likelihood, are considered. It is shown that neither using the mean square error nor using the likelihood can guarantee a monotonic relationship between the predictor error and the optimal control cost. To guarantee control cost improvement, it is suggested the predictor should be evaluated with the control performance, e.g., using the optimal control cost or the regret to evaluate predictors. Numerical examples and examples from automotive applications with real-world driving data are provided to illustrate the ideas and the results.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Joint Ramping and Regulation-Type Service from Distributed Energy Resource Aggregations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as grid-responsive loads and batteries can be harnessed to provide ramping and regulation services across the grid. This paper concerns the problem of optimal allocation of different classes of DERs, where each class is an aggregation of similar DERs, to balance net-demand forecasts. The resulting resource allocation problem is solved using model-predictive control (MPC) that utilizes a rolling sequence of finite time-horizon constrained optimizations. This is based on the concept that we have more accurate estimates of the load forecast in the short term, so each optimization in the rolling sequence of optimization problems uses more accurate short term load forecasts while ensuring satisfaction of capacity and dynamical constraints. Simulations demonstrate that the MPC solution can indeed reduce the ramping required from bulk generation, while mitigating near-real time grid disturbances.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic tube-based control synthesis of stochastic multi-agent systems under signal temporal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the control design of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent systems (MASs) under a global signal temporal logic (STL) specification to be satisfied at a predefined probability. By decomposing the dynamics into deterministic and error components, we construct a probabilistic reachable tube (PRT) as the Cartesian product of reachable sets of the individual error systems driven by disturbances lying in confidence regions (CRs) with a fixed probability. By bounding the PRT probability with the specification probability, we tighten all state constraints induced by the STL specification by solving tractable optimization problems over segments of the PRT, and convert the underlying stochastic problem into a deterministic one. This approach reduces conservatism compared to tightening guided by the STL structure. Additionally, we propose a recursively feasible algorithm to attack the resulting problem by decomposing it into agent-level subproblems, which are solved iteratively according to a scheduling policy. We demonstrate our method on a ten-agent system, where existing approaches are impractical.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Identifying Regulation with Adversarial Surrogates Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a time-series of noisy measured outputs of a dynamical system z[k], k=1...N, the Identifying Regulation with Adversarial Surrogates (IRAS) algorithm aims to find a non-trivial first integral of the system, namely, a scalar function g() such that g(z[i]) = g(z[j]), for all i,j. IRAS has been suggested recently and was used successfully in several learning tasks in models from biology and physics. Here, we give the first rigorous analysis of this algorithm in a specific setting. We assume that the observations admit a linear first integral and that they are contaminated by Gaussian noise. We show that in this case the IRAS iterations are closely related to the self-consistent-field (SCF) iterations for solving a generalized Rayleigh quotient minimization problem. Using this approach, we derive several sufficient conditions guaranteeing local convergence of IRAS to the correct first integral.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Energy from Soil-Air Temperature Differences for Batteryless IoT Devices: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature difference between soil and air holds the potential to generate energy to power many low-power IoT devices. However, there is a lack of studies in the literature that explore the nuances of soil-air thermal energy harvesting. This paper offers a comprehensive discussion on soil-air thermal energy harvesting. We engineer a custom Soil-air Thermoelectric Generator (SoTEG) that incorporates an off-the-shelf TEG and an efficient heat transfer network. A detailed discussion of the design and analysis of SoTEG is presented along with a versatile simulation model which can be used to simulate the performance of the harvester under different ambient conditions. Investigations using the model and results gathered from experiments demonstrate that the SoTEG has a heat transfer efficiency of 34.5% with room for improvement and can power a load from temperature differences as low as 3 {\deg}C between soil and air, or 1 {\deg}C across the TEG. Power generated by SoTEG at 3 {\deg}C difference amounts to 110 {\mu}Wor a power density of 11.58mW/m2. When connected to a Power Management Unit (PMU), the combined system generates around 30 {\mu}Wat 3 {\deg}C. During a 14-day outdoor deployment in a winter month, the maximum power generated by the combined system is 337 {\mu}W when the temperature difference across the TEG is 2.75 {\deg}C. Additionally, the model analysis reveals that the weather conditions have an impact on the harvester. While Solar radiation enhances power generation, wind can either improve or diminish the harvested energy depending on whether it is day or night.</description>

      <title>Extended State Observer for Mismatch Disturbances Using Taylor Approximation of the Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of disturbance estimators using extended state observers (ESOs) typically assumes that the system is observable. This paper introduces an improved method for systems that are initially unobservable, leveraging Taylor expansion to approximate the integral of disturbance dynamics. A new extended system is formulated based on this approximation, enabling the design of an observer that achieves exponential stability of the error dynamics. The proposed method's efficacy is demonstrated through a practical example, highlighting its potential for robust disturbance estimation in dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Compression-based Privacy Preservation for Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking in Aggregative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores distributed aggregative games in multi-agent systems. Current methods for finding distributed Nash equilibrium require players to send original messages to their neighbors, leading to communication burden and privacy issues. To jointly address these issues, we propose an algorithm that uses stochastic compression to save communication resources and conceal information through random errors induced by compression. Our theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm guarantees convergence accuracy, even with aggressive compression errors used to protect privacy. We prove that the algorithm achieves differential privacy through a stochastic quantization scheme. Simulation results for energy consumption games support the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Repurposed Kaplan Turbines as Variable-Speed Propellers for Maximizing Frequency Containment Reserve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the practical viability of repurposing aging Kaplan turbines into variable-speed propellers by employing full-size frequency converters. The motivation behind this approach is to improve the provision of \emph{Frequency Containment Reserve} (FCR) while reducing fatigue in the Kaplan blades servomechanism. We evaluate the performance of these modified Kaplan turbines against the one of another hydro asset composed of the same Kaplan turbine hybridized with a \emph{Battery Energy Storage System} (BESS). Experiments are conducted on a one-of-its-kind reduced-scale model testing platform. Our findings reveal that Kaplan turbines repurposed as variable-speed propellers exhibit similar dynamic response characteristics compared to the standalone Kaplan operation, with the added benefit of effectively eliminating blade movements. Furthermore, the ability to control the speed increases the hydraulic efficiency for certain operating points. In summary, investment in variable speed technology emerges as a viable alternative to BESS-based hydropower hybridization.</description>

      <title>How improving performance may imply losing consistency in event-triggered consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-triggered control is often argued to lower the average triggering rate compared to time-triggered control while still achieving a desired control goal, e.g., the same performance level. However, this property, often called consistency, cannot be taken for granted and can be hard to analyze in many settings. In particular, although numerous decentralized event-triggered control schemes have been proposed in the past years, their performance properties with respect to time-triggered control remain mostly unexplored. In this paper, we therefore examine the performance properties of event-triggered control (relative to time-triggered control) for a single-integrator consensus problem with a level-triggering rule. We consider the long-term average quadratic deviation from consensus as a performance measure. For this setting, we show that enriching the information the local controllers use improves the performance of the consensus algorithm but renders a previously consistent event-triggered control scheme inconsistent. In addition, we do so while deploying optimal control inputs which we derive for both information cases and all triggering schemes. With this insight, we can furthermore explain the relationship between two contrasting consistency results from the literature on decentralized event-triggered control. We support our theoretical findings with simulation results.</description>

      <title>On the constrained feedback linearization control based on the MILP representation of a ReLU-ANN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the efficacy of rectified linear unit artificial neural networks in addressing the intricate challenges of convoluted constraints arising from feedback linearization mapping. Our approach involves a comprehensive procedure, encompassing the approximation of constraints through a regression process. Subsequently, we transform these constraints into an equivalent representation of mixed-integer linear constraints, seamlessly integrating them into other stabilizing control architectures. The advantage resides in the compatibility with the linear control design and the constraint satisfaction in the model predictive control setup, even for forecasted trajectories. Simulations are provided to validate the proposed constraint reformulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy market, and specifically the renewable sector carries volatility and risks, similar to the financial market. Here, we leverage on a well-established, return-risk approach, commonly used by equity portfolio-managers and apply it to energy resources. We visualize the relationship between the resources' costs and their risks in terms of efficient frontiers. We apply this analysis to publically available data for various US regions: Central, Eastern and Western coasts. Since risk management is contingent on costs, this approach sheds useful light in assessing dynamic pricing in modern electrical grids. By integrating geographical and temporal dimensions into our research, we aim at providing more nuanced and context-specific recommendations for energy resource allocation. This approach may help decision-makers in the renewable energy sector to make informed choices that account for regional variations, climatic conditions, and long-term performance trends.</description>

      <title>Human-Variability-Respecting Optimal Control for Physical Human-Machine Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Human-Machine Interaction plays a pivotal role in facilitating collaboration across various domains. When designing appropriate model-based controllers to assist a human in the interaction, the accuracy of the human model is crucial for the resulting overall behavior of the coupled system. When looking at state-of-the-art control approaches, most methods rely on a deterministic model or no model at all of the human behavior. This poses a gap to the current neuroscientific standard regarding human movement modeling, which uses stochastic optimal control models that include signal-dependent noise processes and therefore describe the human behavior much more accurate than the deterministic counterparts. To close this gap by including these stochastic human models in the control design, we introduce a novel design methodology resulting in a Human-Variability-Respecting Optimal Control that explicitly incorporates the human noise processes and their influence on the mean and variability behavior of a physically coupled human-machine system. Our approach results in an improved overall system performance, i.e. higher accuracy and lower variability in target point reaching, while allowing to shape the joint variability, for example to preserve human natural variability patterns.</description>

      <title>A Valuation Framework for Customers Impacted by Extreme Temperature-Related Outages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme temperature outages can lead to not just economic losses but also various non-energy impacts (NEI) due to significant degradation of indoor operating conditions caused by service disruptions. However, existing resilience assessment approaches lack specificity for extreme temperature conditions. They often overlook temperature-related mortality and neglect the customer characteristics and grid response in the calculation, despite the significant influence of these factors on NEI-related economic losses. This paper aims to address these gaps by introducing a comprehensive framework to estimate the impact of resilience enhancement not only on the direct economic losses incurred by customers but also on potential NEI, including mortality and the value of statistical life during extreme temperature-related outages. The proposed resilience valuation integrates customer characteristics and grid response variables based on a scalable grid simulation environment. This study adopts a holistic approach to quantify customer-oriented economic impacts, utilizing probabilistic loss scenarios that incorporate health-related factors and damage/loss models as a function of exposure for valuation. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through comparative resilient outage planning, using grid response models emulating a Texas weather zone during the 2021 winter storm Uri. The case study results show that enhanced outage planning with hardened infrastructure can improve the system resilience and thereby reduce the relative risk of mortality by 16% and save the total costs related to non-energy impacts by 74%. These findings underscore the efficacy of the framework by assessing the financial implications of each case, providing valuable insights for decision-makers and stakeholders involved in extreme-weather related resilience planning for risk management and mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Configuration-Constrained Tube MPC for Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for tracking varying setpoint references with linear systems subject to additive and multiplicative uncertainties. The MPC controllers designed using this framework exhibit recursively feasible for changing references, and robust asymptotic stability for piecewise constant references. The framework leverages configuration-constrained polytopes to parameterize the tubes, offering flexibility to optimize their shape. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through two numerical examples. The first example illustrates the theoretical results, and the second uses the framework to design a lane-change controller for an autonomous vehicle.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Thermal Management in High-Temperature Applications: Design and Optimization of a Water-Cooled Forced Convection System in a Hollow Cuboid Vapour Chamber Using COMSOL and MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report details the design and optimisation of a water-cooled forced convection heat dissipation system for use in high-temperature applications (ranges between 700 degrees - 1000 degrees K). A hollow cuboid vapour chamber model was investigated. The space within the hollow cuboid was used as the design space. COMSOL, a FEM software product was used to solve for the physical parameters of each geometry for the heat dissipation system design space. COMSOL in conjunction with MATLAB was used for the parametric and density-based topology optimisation of the geometric design in the design space. The goal of the optimization is the minimisation of a temperature gradient over the design space. This allows the heat to be evenly spread throughout the designed mesh which allows for more effective cooling. To reduce the computational time needed to solve and optimise each geometry in 3D, a 2D representation was created for the front and rear faces of the hollow cuboid setup. These 2D face designs were then extrapolated into 3D over the length of the hollow cube and COMSOL was used to find a solution for each model. This report also proposes a use case for this system wherein it would be used in conjunction with MGA and thermometric technology within coal-fired power stations for the extraction and storage of waste heat for later use.</description>

      <title>Noise Models in the LISA Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document briefly describes the noise models and shapes used for the synthesis of the Drag-Free and Attitude Control System in the LISA space mission. LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is one of the next large-class missions from the European Space Agency (ESA), expected to be launched in 2034. The main goal of the mission is to detect the gravitational waves, which are undulatory perturbations of the space-time fabric, extremely important to collect experimental proofs for the General Relativity Theory. In the 90s, different international collaborations of institutes laid the foundations for the first ground-based interferometers (see, e.g., LIGO and Virgo). However, ground-based interferometers have a limited bandwidth due to the Earth's environmental noises and short arm-length of few kilometers. Therefore, they cannot observe gravitational waves belonging to the portion of the spectrum below 1 Hz. This issue can be overcome by means of space-based interferometers, that can have arm-lengths up to millions of kilometers and exploit a quieter environment than the Earth's surface. The LISA system is affected by actuation, sensing and environmental disturbances and noises. Among the actuation noises we have those given by the Micro Propulsion System (MPS), the Gravitational Reference Sensor (GRS) and the Optical Assembly (OA) motor. Among the sensing noises we consider the interferometer, the Differential Wavefront Sensor (DWS) and the GRS. The environmental disturbances are given by the solar radiation pressure, the test-mass stiffness and self-gravity, and the environmental noises acting directly on the test-mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored data collected from railway turnouts are vulnerable to cyberattacks: attackers may either conceal failures or trigger unnecessary maintenance actions. To address this issue, a cyberattack investigation method is proposed based on predictions made from the temporal evolution of the turnout behavior. These predictions are then compared to the field acquired data to detect any discrepancy. This method is illustrated on a collection of real-life data.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for data-driven classification of rock mass using drilling data: How can a data-driven system handle limitations in existing rock mass classification systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rock mass classification systems are crucial for assessing stability and risk in underground construction globally and guiding support and excavation design. However, systems developed primarily in the 1970s lack access to modern high-resolution data and advanced statistical techniques, limiting their effectiveness as decision-support systems. Initially, we outline the limitations observed in this context and later describe how a data-driven system, based on drilling data as detailed in this study, can overcome these limitations. Using extracted statistical information from thousands of MWD-data values in one-meter sections of a full tunnel profile, thus working as a signature of the rock mass, we have demonstrated that it is possible to form well-defined clusters that can act as a foundational basis for various rock mass classification systems. We reduced the dimensionality of 48-value vectors using nonlinear manifold learning techniques (UMAP) and linear principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance clustering. Unsupervised machine learning methods (HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, K-means) were employed to cluster the data, with hyperparameters optimised through multi-objective Bayesian optimisation for effective clustering. Using domain knowledge, we experienced improved clustering and system tuning opportunities in adding extra features to core clusters of MWD-data. We structured and correlated these clusters with physical rock mass properties, including labels of rock type and rock quality, and analysed cumulative distributions of key MWD-parameters for rock mass assessment to determine if clusters meaningfully differentiate rock masses. The ability of MWD data to form distinct rock mass clusters suggests substantial potential for future classification systems grounded in this objective, data-driven methodology, free from human bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio spectrum is a limited resource. Demand for wireless communication services is increasing exponentially, stressing the availability of radio spectrum to accommodate new services. TV White Space (TVWS) technologies allow a dynamic usage of the spectrum. These technologies provide wireless connectivity, in the channels of the Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) television broadcasting bands. In this paper, we investigate and compare the coverage range, network capacity, and network energy efficiency for TVWS technologies and LTE. We consider Ghent, Belgium and Boyeros, Havana, Cuba to evaluate a realistic outdoor suburban and rural area, respectively. The comparison shows that TVWS networks have an energy efficiency 9-12 times higher than LTE networks.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of the Hidden Feedback Loop Effect in Machine Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widespread deployment of societal-scale machine learning systems necessitates a thorough understanding of the resulting long-term effects these systems have on their environment, including loss of trustworthiness, bias amplification, and violation of AI safety requirements. We introduce a repeated learning process to jointly describe several phenomena attributed to unintended hidden feedback loops, such as error amplification, induced concept drift, echo chambers and others. The process comprises the entire cycle of obtaining the data, training the predictive model, and delivering predictions to end-users within a single mathematical model. A distinctive feature of such repeated learning setting is that the state of the environment becomes causally dependent on the learner itself over time, thus violating the usual assumptions about the data distribution. We present a novel dynamical systems model of the repeated learning process and prove the limiting set of probability distributions for positive and negative feedback loop modes of the system operation. We conduct a series of computational experiments using an exemplary supervised learning problem on two synthetic data sets. The results of the experiments correspond to the theoretical predictions derived from the dynamical model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for studying the repeated learning processes in machine learning systems and open a range of opportunities for further research in the area.</description>

      <title>Unscented Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</description>

      <title>Preventive Audits for Data Applications Before Data Sharing in the Power IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increase in data volume, more types of data are being used and shared, especially in the power Internet of Things (IoT). However, the processes of data sharing may lead to unexpected information leakage because of the ubiquitous relevance among the different data, thus it is necessary for data owners to conduct preventive audits for data applications before data sharing to avoid the risk of key information leakage. Considering that the same data may play completely different roles in different application scenarios, data owners should know the expected data applications of the data buyers in advance and provide modified data that are less relevant to the private information of the data owners and more relevant to the nonprivate information that the data buyers need. In this paper, data sharing in the power IoT is regarded as the background, and the mutual information of the data and their implicit information is selected as the data feature parameter to indicate the relevance between the data and their implicit information or the ability to infer the implicit information from the data. Therefore, preventive audits should be conducted based on changes in the data feature parameters before and after data sharing. The probability exchange adjustment method is proposed as the theoretical basis of preventive audits under simplified consumption, and the corresponding optimization models are constructed and extended to more practical scenarios with multivariate characteristics. Finally, case studies are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed preventive audits.</description>

      <title>A Long-Short-Term Mixed-Integer Formulation for Highway Lane Change Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of optimal lane changing in a structured multi-agent road environment. A novel motion planning algorithm that can capture long-horizon dependencies as well as short-horizon dynamics is presented. Pivotal to our approach is a geometric approximation of the long-horizon combinatorial transition problem which we formulate in the continuous time-space domain. Moreover, a discrete-time formulation of a short-horizon optimal motion planning problem is formulated and combined with the long-horizon planner. Both individual problems, as well as their combination, are formulated as MIQP and solved in real-time by using state-of-the-art solvers. We show how the presented algorithm outperforms two other state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms in closed-loop performance and computation time in lane changing problems. Evaluations are performed using the traffic simulator SUMO, a custom low-level tracking model predictive controller, and high-fidelity vehicle models and scenarios, provided by the CommonRoad environment.</description>

      <title>Defense against Joint Poison and Evasion Attacks: A Case Study of DERMS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an upward trend of deploying distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) to control modern power grids. However, DERMS controller communication lines are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could potentially impact operational reliability. While a data-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) can potentially thwart attacks during deployment, also known as the evasion attack, the training of the detection algorithm may be corrupted by adversarial data injected into the database, also known as the poisoning attack. In this paper, we propose the first framework of IDS that is robust against joint poisoning and evasion attacks. We formulate the defense mechanism as a bilevel optimization, where the inner and outer levels deal with attacks that occur during training time and testing time, respectively. We verify the robustness of our method on the IEEE-13 bus feeder model against a diverse set of poisoning and evasion attack scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline technique in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall for intrusion detection.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Real-Time Object Detection for Electric Scooters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric scooters (e-scooters) have rapidly emerged as a popular mode of transportation in urban areas, yet they pose significant safety challenges. In the United States, the rise of e-scooters has been marked by a concerning increase in related injuries and fatalities. Recently, while deep-learning object detection holds paramount significance in autonomous vehicles to avoid potential collisions, its application in the context of e-scooters remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of cutting-edge object detectors designed for e-scooters. To achieve this, the first comprehensive benchmark involving 22 state-of-the-art YOLO object detectors, including five versions (YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8), has been established for real-time traffic object detection using a self-collected dataset featuring e-scooters. The detection accuracy, measured in terms of mAP@0.5, ranges from 27.4% (YOLOv7-E6E) to 86.8% (YOLOv5s). All YOLO models, particularly YOLOv3-tiny, have displayed promising potential for real-time object detection in the context of e-scooters. Both the traffic scene dataset (https://zenodo.org/records/10578641) and software program codes (https://github.com/DongChen06/ScooterDet) for model benchmarking in this study are publicly available, which will not only improve e-scooter safety with advanced object detection but also lay the groundwork for tailored solutions, promising a safer and more sustainable urban micromobility landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Routing and scheduling problems with time windows have long been important optimization problems for logistics and planning. Many classical heuristics and exact methods exist for such problems. However, there are no satisfactory methods for generating routes using quantum computing (QC), for mainly two reasons: inequality constraints, and the trade-off of feasibility and solution quality. Inequality constraints are typically handled using slack variables; and feasible solutions are found by filtering samples. These challenges are amplified in the presence of noise inherent in QC. Here, we propose a greedy algorithm that generates routes by using information from all samples obtained from the quantum computer. By noticing the relationship between qubits in our formulation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we designed an algorithm that adaptively constructs a feasible solution.
  We prove its convergence to a feasible solution, and illustrate its efficacy by solving the Fleet Sizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (FSVRPTW). Our computational results show that this method obtains a lower objective value than the current state-of-the-art annealing approaches, both classical and hybrid, for the same amount of time using D-Wave Hybrid Solvers. We also show its robustness to noise on D-Wave Advantage 4.1 through computational results as compared to the filtering approach on DWaveSampler, even when the filtering approach is given a longer annealing time, and a larger sample size.</description>

      <title>Revealing Decision Conservativeness Through Inverse Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Inverse Distributionally Robust Optimization (I-DRO) as a method to infer the conservativeness level of a decision-maker, represented by the size of a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, from the optimal decisions made using Forward Distributionally Robust Optimization (F-DRO). By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the convex F-DRO model, we formulate I-DRO as a bi-linear program, which can be solved using off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Additionally, this formulation exhibits several advantageous properties. We demonstrate that I-DRO not only guarantees the existence and uniqueness of an optimal solution but also establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for this optimal solution to accurately match the actual conservativeness level in F-DRO. Furthermore, we identify three extreme scenarios that may impact I-DRO effectiveness. Our case study applies F-DRO for power system scheduling under uncertainty and employs I-DRO to recover the conservativeness level of system operators. Numerical experiments based on an IEEE 5-bus system and a realistic NYISO 11-zone system demonstrate I-DRO performance in both normal and extreme scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, smart factories have emerged as a paradigm shift, redefining manufacturing with the integration of advanced digital technologies. Central to this transformation is the deployment of 5G networks, offering unprecedented levels of connectivity, speed, reliability, and ultra-low latency. Among the revolutionary features of 5G is network slicing, a technology that offers enhanced capabilities through the customization of network resources by allowing multiple logical networks (or slices) to run on top of a shared physical infrastructure. This capability is particularly crucial in the densely packed and highly dynamic environment of smart factories, where diverse applications - from robotic automation to real-time analytics - demand varying network requirements. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the integration of slicing in smart factory networks, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing operational efficiency and supporting the diverse requirements of future manufacturing processes. We elaborate on the recent advances, and technical scenarios, including indoor factory propagation conditions, traffic characteristics, system requirements, slice-aware radio resource management, network elements, enabling technologies and current standardisation efforts. Additionally, we identify open research challenges as well as key technical issues stifling deployments. Finally, we speculate on the future trajectory of slicing-enabled smart factories, emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation to emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>On-site scale factor linearity calibration of MEMS triaxial gyroscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calibration of MEMS triaxial gyroscopes is crucial for achieving precise attitude estimation for various wearable health monitoring applications. However, gyroscope calibration poses greater challenges compared to accelerometers and magnetometers. This paper introduces an efficient method for calibrating MEMS triaxial gyroscopes via only a servo motor, making it well-suited for field environments. The core strategy of the method involves utilizing the fact that the dot product of the measured gravity and the rotational speed in a fixed frame remains constant. To eliminate the influence of rotating centrifugal force on the accelerometer, the accelerometer data is measured while stationary. The proposed calibration experiment scheme, which allows gyroscopic measurements when operating each axis at a specific rotation speed, making it easier to evaluate the linearity across a related speed range constituted by a series of rotation speeds. Moreover, solely the classical least squares algorithm proves adequate for estimating the scale factor, notably streamlining the analysis of the calibration process. Extensive numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the proposed method's performance in calibrating a triaxial gyroscope model. Experimental validation was also carried out using a commercially available MEMS inertial measurement unit (LSM9DS1 from Arduino nano 33 BLE SENSE) and a servo motor capable of controlling precise speed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed calibration approach.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning under Uncertainty: Integrating Learning-Based Multi-Modal Predictors into Branch Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex traffic environments, autonomous vehicles face multi-modal uncertainty about other agents' future behavior. To address this, recent advancements in learningbased motion predictors output multi-modal predictions. We present our novel framework that leverages Branch Model Predictive Control(BMPC) to account for these predictions. The framework includes an online scenario-selection process guided by topology and collision risk criteria. This efficiently selects a minimal set of predictions, rendering the BMPC realtime capable. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive decision postponing strategy that delays the planner's commitment to a single scenario until the uncertainty is resolved. Our comprehensive evaluations in traffic intersection and random highway merging scenarios demonstrate enhanced comfort and safety through our method.</description>

      <title>Model- and Data-Based Control of Self-Balancing Robots: Practical Educational Approach with LabVIEW and Arduino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-wheeled self-balancing robot (TWSBR) is non-linear and unstable system. This study compares the performance of model-based and data-based control strategies for TWSBRs, with an explicit practical educational approach. Model-based control (MBC) algorithms such as Lead-Lag and PID control require a proficient dynamic modeling and mathematical manipulation to drive the linearized equations of motions and develop the appropriate controller. On the other side, data-based control (DBC) methods, like fuzzy control, provide a simpler and quicker approach to designing effective controllers without needing in-depth understanding of the system model. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of both MBC and DBC using a TWSBR are illustrated. All controllers were implemented and tested on the OSOYOO self-balancing kit, including an Arduino microcontroller, MPU-6050 sensor, and DC motors. The control law and the user interface are constructed using the LabVIEW-LINX toolkit. A real-time hardware-in-loop experiment validates the results, highlighting controllers that can be implemented on a cost-effective platform.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Nonlinear Cloud-based Model Predictive Control via Affine Masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of 5G technology that presents enhanced communication reliability and ultra low latency, there is renewed interest in employing cloud computing to perform high performance but computationally expensive control schemes like nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). Such a cloud-based control scheme, however, requires data sharing between the plant (agent) and the cloud, which raises privacy concerns. This is because privacy-sensitive information such as system states and control inputs has to be sent to/from the cloud and thus can be leaked to attackers for various malicious activities. In this paper, we develop a simple yet effective affine masking strategy for privacy-preserving nonlinear MPC. Specifically, we consider external eavesdroppers or honest-but-curious cloud servers that wiretap the communication channel and intend to infer the plant's information including state information and control inputs. An affine transformation-based privacy-preservation mechanism is designed to mask the true states and control signals while reformulating the original MPC problem into a different but equivalent form. We show that the proposed privacy scheme does not affect the MPC performance and it preserves the privacy of the plant such that the eavesdropper is unable to identify the actual value or even estimate a rough range of the private state and input signals. The proposed method is further extended to achieve privacy preservation in cloud-based output-feedback MPC. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalized Forgetting Recursive Least Squares: Stability and Robustness Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents generalized forgetting recursive least squares (GF-RLS), a generalization of recursive least squares (RLS) that encompasses many extensions of RLS as special cases. First, sufficient conditions are presented for the 1) Lyapunov stability, 2) uniform Lyapunov stability, 3) global asymptotic stability, and 4) global uniform exponential stability of parameter estimation error in GF-RLS when estimating fixed parameters without noise. Second, robustness guarantees are derived for the estimation of time-varying parameters in the presence of measurement noise and regressor noise. These robustness guarantees are presented in terms of global uniform ultimate boundedness of the parameter estimation error. A specialization of this result gives a bound to the asymptotic bias of least squares estimators in the errors-in-variables problem. Lastly, a survey is presented to show how GF-RLS can be used to analyze various extensions of RLS from the literature.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Average Consensus with Improved Accuracy-Privacy Trade-off</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the average consensus problem with differential privacy of initial states, for which it is widely recognized that there is a trade-off between the mean-square computation accuracy and privacy level. Considering the trade-off gap between the average consensus algorithm and the centralized averaging approach with differential privacy, we propose a distributed shuffling mechanism based on the Paillier cryptosystem to generate correlated zero-sum randomness. By randomizing each local privacy-sensitive initial state with an i.i.d. Gaussian noise and the output of the mechanism using Gaussian noises, it is shown that the resulting average consensus algorithm can eliminate the gap in the sense that the accuracy-privacy trade-off of the centralized averaging approach with differential privacy can be almost recovered by appropriately designing the variances of the added noises. We also extend such a design framework with Gaussian noises to the one using Laplace noises, and show that the improved privacy-accuracy trade-off is preserved.</description>

      <title>A Behavioral Perspective on Models of Linear Dynamical Networks with Manifest Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of dynamical systems play an important role in various domains and have motivated many studies on the control and analysis of linear dynamical networks. For linear network models considered in these studies, it is typically pre-determined what signal channels are inputs and what are outputs. These models do not capture the practical need to incorporate different experimental situations, where different selections of input and output channels are applied to the same network. Moreover, a unified view of different network models is lacking. This work makes an initial step towards addressing the above issues by taking a behavioral perspective, where input and output channels are not pre-determined. The focus of this work is on behavioral network models with only external variables. By exploiting the concept of hypergraphs, novel dual graphical representations, called system graphs and signal graphs, are introduced for behavioral networks. Moreover, connections between behavioral network models and structural vector autoregressive models are established. In addition to their connections in graphical representations, it is shown that the regularity of interconnections is an essential assumption when choosing a structural vector autoregressive model.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Continuous-Time Framework for Frequency-Constrained Unit Commitment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional approach to solving the unit commitment problem involves discrete intervals at an hourly scale, particularly when integrating frequency dynamics to formulate a frequency-constrained unit commitment. To overcome this limitation, a novel continuous-time frequency-constrained unit commitment framework is proposed in this paper. In this approach, Bernstein polynomials represent continuous variables in the unit commitment problem and enable the calculation of frequency response-related metrics such as the rate of change of frequency, quasi-steady-state frequency, and frequency nadir. Notably, startup and shut-down trajectories are meticulously considered, transforming the formulation into a fully continuous-time model and simplifying constraints related to variable continuity. To address the complexities associated with integrating the obtained non-linear frequency nadir constraint into a mixed-integer linear problem, an alternative data-driven frequency nadir constraint is proposed, which accurately constrains frequency nadir deviations throughout the time interval. To validate the proposed model, it is applied to the real-life network of the Spanish Island of La Palma. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, indicating that the model is solved timely while mitigating the impact of intra-hour real-time power fluctuations on system frequency.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to introduce a new statistical learning technique based on sparsity promoting for data-driven modeling and control of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Compared with conventional sparse regression techniques that might introduce computational complexities when the number of candidate functions increases, an innovative algorithm, named adaptive regulated sparse regression (ARSR) is proposed that adaptively regulates the hyperparameter weights of candidate functions to best represent the dynamics of PV systems. Utilizing this algorithm, open-loop and closed-loop models of single-stage and two-stage PV systems are obtained from measurements and are utilized for control design purposes. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed data-driven approach can successfully be employed for fault analysis studies, which distinguishes its capabilities compared with other data-driven techniques. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through real-time simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: UltimateKalman is a flexible linear Kalman filter and smoother implemented in three popular programming languages: MATLAB, C, and Java. UltimateKalman is a slight simplification and slight generalization of an elegant Kalman filter and smoother that was proposed in 1977 by Paige and Saunders. Their algorithm appears to be numerically superior and more flexible than other Kalman filters and smoothers, but curiously has never been implemented or used before. UltimateKalman is flexible: it can easily handle time-dependent problems, problems with state vectors whose dimensions vary from step to step, problems with varying number of observations in different steps (or no observations at all in some steps), and problems in which the expectation of the initial state is unknown. The programming interface of UltimateKalman is broken into simple building blocks that can be used to construct filters, single or multi-step predictors, multi-step or whole-track smoothers, and combinations. The paper describes the algorithm and its implementation as well as with a test suite of examples and tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An innovative millimeter-wave (mm-wave) microstrip edge-fed antenna (EFA) for 77 GHz automotive radars is proposed. The radiator contour is modeled with a sinusoidal spline-shaped (SS) profile characterized by a reduced number of geometrical descriptors, but still able to guarantee a high flexibility in the modeling for fulfilling challenging user-defined requirements. The SS-EFA descriptors are effectively and efficiently optimized with a customized implementation of the System-by-Design (SbD) paradigm. The synthesized EFA layout, integrated within a linear arrangement of identical replicas to account for the integration into the real radar system, exhibits suitable impedance matching, isolation, polarization purity, and stability of the beam shaping/pointing within the target band [76:78][GHz]. The experimental assessment, carried out with a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) system on a printed circuit board (PCB)-manufactured prototype, assess the reliability of the outcomes from the full-wave (FW) simulations as well as the suitability of the synthesized SS-EFA for automotive radars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) facilitates the enhancement of traffic efficiency in complicated scenarios. In unsignalized roundabout scenarios, difficulties remain unsolved in developing an effective and efficient coordination strategy for CAVs. In this paper, we formulate the cooperative autonomous driving problem of CAVs in the roundabout scenario as a constrained optimal control problem, and propose a computationally-efficient parallel optimization framework to generate strategies for CAVs such that the travel efficiency is improved with hard safety guarantees. All constraints involved in the roundabout scenario are addressed appropriately with convex approximation, such that the convexity property of the reformulated optimization problem is exhibited. Then, a parallel optimization algorithm is presented to solve the reformulated optimization problem, where an embodied iterative nearest neighbor search strategy to determine the optimal passing sequence in the roundabout scenario. It is noteworthy that the travel efficiency in the roundabout scenario is enhanced and the computation burden is considerably alleviated with the innovation development. We also examine the proposed method in CARLA simulator and perform thorough comparisons with a rule-based baseline and the commonly used IPOPT optimization solver to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: Optically-transparent opportunistic electromagnetic skins (OTO-EMSs) are proposed to enable outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) millimiter-wave (mmW) wireless communications with existing windows/glass-panels. More in detail, static passive EMSs consisting of optically-transparent conducting patterned layers attached to standard glass-panels are designed. Towards this end, both the phase coverage and the optical transparency of a meshed copper-based meta-atom printed on a non-dedicated insulated glass substrate are optimized. Successively, the feasibility of OTO-EMSs able to support mmW high-efficiency O2I transmissions along non-Snell refraction directions is numerically demonstrated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel single-frame quaternion estimator processing two vector observations is introduced. The singular cases are examined, and appropriate rotational solutions are provided. Additionally, an alternative method involving sequential rotation is introduced to manage these singularities. The simplicity of the estimator enables clear physical insights and a closed-form expression for the bias as a function of the quaternion error covariance matrix. The covariance could be approximated up to second order with respect to the underlying measurement noise assuming arbitrary probability distribution. The current note relaxes the second-order assumption and provides an expression for the error covariance that is exact to the fourth order, under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. A comprehensive derivation of the individual components of the quaternion additive error covariance matrix is presented. This not only provides increased accuracy but also alleviates issues related to singularity.</description>

      <title>On the Certification of the Kinematics of 3-DOF Spherical Parallel Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to study a specific kind of parallel robot: Spherical Parallel Manipulators (SPM) that are capable of unlimited rolling. A focus is made on the kinematics of such mechanisms, especially taking into account uncertainties (e.g. on conception &amp; fabrication parameters, measures) and their propagations. Such considerations are crucial if we want to control our robot correctly without any undesirable behavior in its workspace (e.g. effects of singularities). In this paper, we will consider two different approaches to study the kinematics and the singularities of the robot of interest: symbolic and semi-numerical. By doing so, we can compute a singularity-free zone in the work- and joint spaces, considering given uncertainties on the parameters. In this zone, we can use any control law to inertially stabilize the upper platform of the robot.</description>

      <title>Providing Safety Assurances for Systems with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more complex and integral in our society, the need to accurately model and safely control these systems has increased significantly. In the past decade, there has been tremendous success in using deep learning techniques to model and control systems that are difficult to model using first principles. However, providing safety assurances for such systems remains difficult, partially due to the uncertainty in the learned model. In this work, we aim to provide safety assurances for systems whose dynamics are not readily derived from first principles and, hence, are more advantageous to be learned using deep learning techniques. Given the system of interest and safety constraints, we learn an ensemble model of the system dynamics from data. Leveraging ensemble uncertainty as a measure of uncertainty in the learned dynamics model, we compute a maximal robust control invariant set, starting from which the system is guaranteed to satisfy the safety constraints under the condition that realized model uncertainties are contained in the predefined set of admissible model uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a simulated case study with an inverted pendulum and a hardware experiment with a TurtleBot. The experiments show that our method robustifies the control actions of the system against model uncertainty and generates safe behaviors without being overly restrictive. The codes and accompanying videos can be found on the project website.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Permissible Safe Control with Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method of identifying a maximal set of safe strategies from data for stochastic systems with unknown dynamics using barrier certificates. The first step is learning the dynamics of the system via Gaussian process (GP) regression and obtaining probabilistic errors for this estimate. Then, we develop an algorithm for constructing piecewise stochastic barrier functions to find a maximal permissible strategy set using the learned GP model, which is based on sequentially pruning the worst controls until a maximal set is identified. The permissible strategies are guaranteed to maintain probabilistic safety for the true system. This is especially important for learning-enabled systems, because a rich strategy space enables additional data collection and complex behaviors while remaining safe. Case studies on linear and nonlinear systems demonstrate that increasing the size of the dataset for learning the system grows the permissible strategy set.</description>

      <title>Enhance Planning with Physics-informed Safety Controller for End-to-end Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing research interest in applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on autonomous vehicle technology. The trend started with perception and prediction a few years ago and it is gradually being applied to motion planning tasks. Despite the performance of networks improve over time, DNN planners inherit the natural drawbacks of Deep Learning. Learning-based planners have limitations in achieving perfect accuracy on the training dataset and network performance can be affected by out-of-distribution problem. In this paper, we propose FusionAssurance, a novel trajectory-based end-to-end driving fusion framework which combines physics-informed control for safety assurance. By incorporating Potential Field into Model Predictive Control, FusionAssurance is capable of navigating through scenarios that are not included in the training dataset and scenarios where neural network fail to generalize. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments under various scenarios on the CARLA benchmark.</description>
