      <title>On Geometry, Arithmetics and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main result is that chaos in dimension $n+1$ is a one-dimensional geometrical object embedded in a geometrical object of dimension $n$ which corresponds to a $n$ dimensional object which is either singular or non-singular. Our main result is then that this chaos occurs in the first case as either on an isolated or non-isolated singularity. In the first case this chaos is either boundary chaos or spherical chaos which is what happens also in the non-singular case. In the case of an isolated singular geometry one has chaos which can either be boundary, spherical or tubular chaos. We furthermore prove that the prime numbers display quantum behaviour.</description>

      <title>The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation or the modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at finite masses, are proved to be equal.</description>

      <title>IsUMap: Manifold Learning and Data Visualization leveraging Vietoris-Rips filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces IsUMap, a novel manifold learning technique that enhances data representation by integrating aspects of UMAP and Isomap with Vietoris-Rips filtrations. We present a systematic and detailed construction of a metric representation for locally distorted metric spaces that captures complex data structures more accurately than the previous schemes. Our approach addresses limitations in existing methods by accommodating non-uniform data distributions and intricate local geometries. We validate its performance through extensive experiments on examples of various geometric objects and benchmark real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in representation quality.</description>

      <title>Projective rigiity of point-line configurations in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general setup for studying incidence-preserving motions of projective geometric configurations of points and lines via a "projective rigidity matrix". The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a point-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can be interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix, respectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix for analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions. The symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an autopolarity.</description>

      <title>Great Circle Fibrations and Contact Structures on Odd-Dimensional Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.06370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that for every smooth great circle fibration of the 3-sphere, the distribution of tangent 2-planes orthogonal to the fibres is a contact structure, in fact a tight one, but we show here that, beginning with the 5-sphere, there exist smooth great circle fibrations of all odd-dimensional spheres for which the hyperplane distribution orthogonal to the fibres is not a contact structure.</description>

      <title>Evolving Surfaces and Evolving Implicit Differential Equations Via Contact Geometry and Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.00967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the list of unavoidable local phenomena (transitions) occurring on the configuration of the parabolic and flecnodal curves of evolving smooth surfaces in R^3 (or RP^3). We also present the list of transitions occurring on the curve of inflections of the solutions of evolving implicit differential equations (IDE). Our results are based on the properties of the contours of surfaces (in a contact 3-space) for projections all whose fibres are Legendrian. Keywords: Surface, flecnodal curve, contact geometry, implicit differential equations.</description>

      <title>Any Sasakian structure is approximated by embeddings into spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for any given $q\geq 0$, any Sasakian structure on a closed manifold $M$ is approximated in the $C^{q}$-norm by structures induced by CR embeddings into weighted Sasakian spheres. In order to obtain this result, we also strengthen the approximation of an orbifold K\"ahler form by projectively induced ones given by Ross and Thomas in [21] in the $C^0$-norm to a $C^{q}$-approximation.</description>

      <title>Lie Admissible Triple Algebras: The Connection Algebra of Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associated to a symmetric space there is a canonical connection with zero torsion and parallel curvature. This connection acts as a binary operator on the vector space of smooth sections of the tangent bundle, and it is linear with respect to the real numbers. Thus the smooth section of the tangent bundle together with the connection form an algebra we call the connection algebra. The constraints of zero torsion and constant curvature makes the connection algebra into a Lie admissible triple algebra. This is a type of algebra that generalises pre-Lie algebras, and it can be embedded into a post-Lie algebra in a canonical way that generalises the canonical embedding of Lie triple systems into Lie algebras. The free Lie admissible triple algebra can be described by incorporating triple-brackets into the leaves of rooted (non-planar) trees.</description>

      <title>Toral symmetries of collapsed ancient solutions to the homogeneous Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collapsed ancient solutions to the homogeneous Ricci flow on compact manifolds occur only on the total space of principal torus bundles. Under an algebraic assumption that guarantees flowing through diagonal metrics and a tameness assumption on the collapsing directions, we prove that such solutions have additional symmetries, i.e., they are invariant under the right action of their collapsing torus. As a byproduct of these additional torus symmetries, we prove that these solutions converge, backward in time, in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to an Einstein metric on the base of a torus bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We collect several results concerning regularity of minimal laminations, and governing the various modes of convergence for sequences of minimal laminations. We then apply this theory to prove that a function has locally least gradient (is $1$-harmonic) iff its level sets are a minimal lamination; this resolves an open problem of Daskalopoulos and Uhlenbeck.</description>

      <title>Geometric structures on the quaternionic unit ball and slice regular M\"obius transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building from ideas of hypercomplex analysis on the quaternionic unit ball, we introduce Hermitian, Riemannian and K\"ahler-like structures on the latter. These are built from the so-called regular M\"obius transformations. Such geometric structures are shown to be natural generalizations of those from the complex setup. Our structures can be considered as more natural, from the hypercomplex viewpoint, than the usual quaternionic hyperbolic geometry. Furthermore, our constructions provide solutions to problems not achieved by hyper-K\"ahler and quaternion-K\"ahler geometries when applied to the quaternionic unit ball. We prove that the Riemannian metric obtained in this work yields the same tensor previously computed by Arcozzi-Sarfatti. However, our approach is completely geometric as opposed to the function theoretic methods of Arcozzi-Sarfatti.</description>

      <title>On the Myrberg Limit Sets and Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan Measures for Certain Manifolds without Conjugate Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify the strong relationship between Myrberg type dynamics and the ergodic properties of the geodesic flows on (not necessarily compact) uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points. We prove that the positivity of the Patterson-Sullivan measure of the Myrberg limit set is equivalent to the conservativity of the geodesic flow with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Moreover we show that the Myrberg limit set is a full Patterson-Sullivan measure subset of the conical limit set.</description>
