      <title>Ranging of a Moving Ship Using a Single Acoustic Receiver in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive acoustics is a versatile tool for maritime situational awareness, enabling applications such as source detection and localization, marine mammal tracking, and geoacoustic inversion. This study focuses on estimating the range between an acoustic receiver and a transiting ship in an acoustically range-independent shallow water environment. Here, acoustic propagation can be modeled by a set of normal modes that are determined by the shallow water waveguide and seabed characteristics. These modes are dispersive, with phase and group velocities varying with frequency, and their interference produces striation patterns that depend on range and frequency in single-hydrophone spectrograms. These patterns can often be characterized by the waveguide invariant, a single parameter describing the waveguide's properties. This paper presents a statistical waveguide invariant-based range estimation approach using a single hydrophone, leveraging broadband and tonal sounds from a transiting ship. Using data from the Seabed Characterization Experiment 2017 (SBCEX17), a large commercial ship's radiated acoustic signature within a 7 Hz bandwidth was processed to estimate its range up to 45 km with errors below three percent.</description>

      <title>Memory-less and Backscatter-less Tunnel Diode Harmonic Signatures for RFID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunnel diodes have traditionally been researched for extending backscatter read-ranges for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags as reflection amplifiers. This paper explores the natural harmonics that arise from biasing these diodes within their negative differential resistance regions and with no interrogating signal from a transmitting source, such as an RFID reader, to injection-lock these diodes. These harmonics are characterized for five tunnel diode boards, made with the same components and with each board's fundamental frequencies measuring at above -15 dBm at a biasing voltage of 200 mV when measured over-the-cable. The occurrence of these harmonics creates unique harmonic signatures for each board and demonstrates possible harmonic RFID applications that can help RFID readers discover and even identify RFID tags with backscatter-less and memory-less IDs generated by tunnel diodes.</description>

      <title>Embracing Diffraction: A Paradigm Shift in Wireless Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless signals are integral to modern society, enabling both communication and increasingly, environmental sensing. While various propagation models exist, ranging from empirical methods to full-wave simulations, the phenomenon of electromagnetic diffraction is often treated as a secondary effect or a correction factor. This paper positions diffraction as a fundamentally important and underutilized mechanism that is rich with information about the physical environment. Specifically, diffraction-inducing elements generate distinct signatures that are rich with information about their underlying properties such as their geometries. We then argue that by understanding and exploiting these relationships, diffraction can be harnessed strategically. We introduce a general optimization framework to formalize this concept, illustrating how diffraction can be leveraged for both inverse problems (sensing scene details such as object geometries from measured fields) and forward problems (shaping RF fields for communication objectives by configuring diffracting elements). Focusing primarily on edge diffraction and Keller's Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), we discuss specific applications in RF sensing for scene understanding and in communications for RF field programming, drawing upon recent work. Overall, this paper lays out a vision for systematically incorporating diffraction into the design and operation of future wireless systems, paving the way for enhanced sensing capabilities and more robust communication strategies.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Mechanisms Behind Structural Influences on Link Prediction: A Case Study on FB15k-237</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FB15k-237 mitigates the data leakage issue by excluding inverse and symmetric relationship triples, however, this has led to substantial performance degradation and slow improvement progress. Traditional approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness on FB15k-237, primarily because the underlying mechanism by which structural features of the dataset influence model performance remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we systematically investigate the impact mechanism of dataset structural features on link prediction performance. Firstly, we design a structured subgraph sampling strategy that ensures connectivity while constructing subgraphs with distinct structural features. Then, through correlation and sensitivity analyses conducted across several mainstream models, we observe that the distribution of relationship categories within subgraphs significantly affects performance, followed by the size of strongly connected components. Further exploration using the LIME model clarifies the intrinsic mechanism by which relationship categories influence link prediction performance, revealing that relationship categories primarily modulate the relative importance between entity embeddings and relationship embeddings and relationship embeddings, thereby affecting link prediction outcomes. These findings provide theoretical insights for addressing performance bottlenecks on FB15k-237, while the proposed analytical framework also offers methodological guidance for future studies dealing with structurally constrained datasets.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Structural State Estimation via Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided wave-based techniques have been used extensively in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Models using guided waves can provide information from both time and frequency domains to make themselves accurate and robust. Probabilistic SHM models, which have the ability to account for uncertainties, are developed when decision confidence intervals are of interest. Most active-sensing guided-wave methods rely on the assumption that a large dataset can be collected, making them impractical when data collection is constrained by time or environmental factors. Meanwhile, although simulation results may lack the accuracy of real-world data, they are easier to obtain. In this context, models that integrate data from multiple sources have the potential to combine the accuracy of experimental data with the convenience of simulated data, without requiring large and potentially costly experimental datasets. The goal of this work is to introduce and assess a probabilistic multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression framework for damage state estimation via the use of both experimental and simulated guided waves. The main differences from previous works include the integration of damage-sensitive features (damage indices, DIs) extracted from both experimental and numerical sources, as well as the use of a relatively small amount of real-world data. The proposed model was validated by two test cases where multiple data sources exist. For each test case, experimental data were collected from a piezoelectric sensor network attached to an aluminum plate with various structural conditions, while simulated data were generated using either multiphysics finite element model (FEM) or physics-based signal reconstruction approaches under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>A brain-inspired generative model for EEG-based cognitive state identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a brain-inspired generative (BIG) model that merges an impulsive-attention neural network and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for identifying cognitive states based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. A hybrid learning method is presented for training the model by integrating gradient-based learning and heteroassociative memory. The BIG model is capable of achieving multi-task objectives: classification, generating new EEG, and brain network interpretation, alleviating the limitations of excessive data training and high computational cost in conventional approaches. Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that the BIG model achieves a classification accuracy above 89\%, comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational cost by nearly 11\% over the baseline EEGNet. Incorporating the generated EEG data for training, the BIG model exhibits comparative performance in a few-shot pattern.Ablation studies justify the poised brain-inspired characteristic regarding the impulsive-attention module and the hybrid learning method. Thanks to the performance advantages with interpretable outputs, this BIG model has application potential for building digital twins of the brain.</description>

      <title>Real-Time, Single-Ear, Wearable ECG Reconstruction, R-Peak Detection, and HR/HRV Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biosignal monitoring, in particular heart activity through heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) tracking, is vital in enabling continuous, non-invasive tracking of physiological and cognitive states. Recent studies have explored compact, head-worn devices for HR and HRV monitoring to improve usability and reduce stigma. However, this approach is challenged by the current reliance on wet electrodes, which limits usability, the weakness of ear-derived signals, making HR/HRV extraction more complex, and the incompatibility of current algorithms for embedded deployment. This work introduces a single-ear wearable system for real-time ECG (Electrocardiogram) parameter estimation, which directly runs on BioGAP, an energy-efficient device for biosignal acquisition and processing. By combining SoA in-ear electrode technology, an optimized DeepMF algorithm, and BioGAP, our proposed subject-independent approach allows for robust extraction of HR/HRV parameters directly on the device with just 36.7 uJ/inference at comparable performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art architecture, achieving 0.49 bpm and 25.82 ms for HR/HRV mean errors, respectively and an estimated battery life of 36h with a total system power consumption of 7.6 mW. Clinical relevance: The ability to reconstruct ECG signals and extract HR and HRV paves the way for continuous, unobtrusive cardiovascular monitoring with head-worn devices. In particular, the integration of cardiovascular measurements in everyday-use devices (such as earbuds) has potential in continuous at-home monitoring to enable early detection of cardiovascular irregularities.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna-enabled ISAC Systems: Exploiting Look-Angle Dependence of RCS for Target Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system supported by pinching antennas (PAs), which can be dynamically activated along a dielectric waveguide to collect spatially diverse observations. This capability allows different PAs to view the same target from different angles across time, thereby introducing target diversity, which is a key advantage over conventional fixed antenna arrays. To quantify the sensing reliability, we adopt the outage probability as a performance metric, capturing the likelihood that the accumulated radar echo signal power falls below a detection threshold. In contrast to traditional ISAC models that assume deterministic sensing channels, we explicitly account for the look-angle dependence of radar cross-section (RCS) by modeling it as a random variable. We ensure the long-term quality-of-service (QoS) for communication users by enforcing an accumulated data rate constraint over time. We derive an exact closed-form expression for the sensing outage probability based on the distribution of weighted sums of exponentially distributed random variables. Since the resulting expression is highly non-convex and intractable for optimization, we use a tractable upper bound based on the Chernoff inequality and formulate a PA activation optimization problem. A successive convex approximation (SCA) framework is proposed to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Numerical results show that dynamically activating different PAs across time slots significantly enhances sensing reliability compared to repeatedly activating the same PA at a fixed position and conventional antenna selection schemes, respectively. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating outage-based reliability metrics and target diversity into ISAC systems using PAs.</description>

      <title>Spreading the Wave: Low-Complexity PAPR Reduction for AFDM and OCDM in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is still a common issue in multicarrier signal modulation systems such as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) and Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), which are envisioned to play a central role in 6G networks. To this end, this paper aims to investigate a novel and low-complexity solution towards minimizing the PAPR with the aid of a unified premodulation data spreading paradigm. It analyze four spreading techniques namely, Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT), Discrete Cosine transform (DCT), Zadoff-Chu transform (ZC), and Interleaved Discrete Fourier transform (IDFT), which assist in preallocating energy prior to OCDM and AFDM modulation. The proposed method takes advantage of the inherent characteristics of chirp-based modulation to achieve a notable reduction in PAPR at minimal computational load and no side information as compared to past solutions, such as Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) or Selected Mapping (SLM), which suffers with a high computational complexity. The proposed method has an additional benefit of achieving an improvement in phase selectivity by increasing chirp parameters of AFDM and quadratic phase of OCDM, which amplifies the robustness in doubly dispersive channels. It further reduces interference by smoothing the output spread signal. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate an improvement in the overall energy efficiency and scalability of large ioT sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed ISAC Systems: An Autoencoder Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.</description>

      <title>Near-field 5D Pose Estimation using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 6G is expected to enable many use cases which may rely on accurate knowledge of the location and orientation of user equipment (UE). The conventional localization methods suffer from limitations such as synchronization and high power consumption required for multiple active anchors. This can be mitigated by utilizing a large dimensional passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). This paper presents a novel low-complexity approach for the estimation of 5D pose (i.e. 3D location and 2D orientation) of a UE in near-field RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed approach exploits the symmetric arrangement of uniform planar array of RIS and uniform linear array of UE to decouple the 5D problem into five 1D sub-problems. Further, we solve these sub-problems using a total least squares ESPRIT inspired approach to obtain closed-form solutions.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence implementation of onboard flexible payload and adaptive beamforming using commercial off-the-shelf devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very High Throughput satellites typically provide multibeam coverage, however, a common problem is that there can be a mismatch between the capacity of each beam and the traffic demand: some beams may fall short, while others exceed the requirements. This challenge can be addressed by integrating machine learning with flexible payload and adaptive beamforming techniques. These methods allow for dynamic allocation of payload resources based on real-time capacity needs. As artificial intelligence advances, its ability to automate tasks, enhance efficiency, and increase precision is proving invaluable, especially in satellite communications, where traditional optimization methods are often computationally intensive. AI-driven solutions offer faster, more effective ways to handle complex satellite communication tasks. Artificial intelligence in space has more constraints than other fields, considering the radiation effects, the spaceship power capabilities, mass, and area. Current onboard processing uses legacy space-certified general-purpose processors, costly application-specific integrated circuits, or field-programmable gate arrays subjected to a highly stringent certification process. The increased performance demands of onboard processors to satisfy the accelerated data rates and autonomy requirements have rendered current space-graded processors obsolete. This work is focused on transforming the satellite payload using artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies over available commercial off-the-shelf chips for onboard processing. The objectives include validating artificial intelligence-driven scenarios, focusing on flexible payload and adaptive beamforming as machine learning models onboard. Results show that machine learning models significantly improve signal quality, spectral efficiency, and throughput compared to conventional payload.</description>

      <title>Securing 5G and Beyond-Enabled UAV Networks: Resilience Through Multiagent Learning and Transformers Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving resilience remains a significant challenge for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communications in 5G and 6G networks. Although UAVs benefit from superior positioning capabilities, rate optimization techniques, and extensive line-of-sight (LoS) range, these advantages alone cannot guarantee high reliability across diverse UAV use cases. This limitation becomes particularly evident in urban environments, where UAVs face vulnerability to jamming attacks and where LoS connectivity is frequently compromised by buildings and other physical obstructions. This paper introduces DET-FAIR- WINGS ( Detection-Enhanced Transformer Framework for AI-Resilient Wireless Networks in Ground UAV Systems), a novel solution designed to enhance reliability in UAV communications under attacks. Our system leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and transformer-based detection algorithms to identify attack patterns within the network and subsequently select the most appropriate mechanisms to strengthen reliability in authenticated UAV-Base Station links. The DET-FAIR-WINGS approach integrates both discrete and continuous parameters. Discrete parameters include retransmission attempts, bandwidth partitioning, and notching mechanisms, while continuous parameters encompass beam angles and elevations from both the Base Station (BS) and user devices. The detection part integrates a transformer in the agents to speed up training. Our findings demonstrate that replacing fixed retransmission counts with AI-integrated flexible approaches in 5G networks significantly reduces latency by optimizing decision-making processes within 5G layers.</description>

      <title>Predictive and Proactive Power Allocation For Energy Efficiency in Dynamic OWC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the exponential growth in data traffic and the limitations of Radio Frequency (RF) networks, Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for high data rate communication. However, the inherently dynamic nature of OWC environments resulting from user mobility, and time-varying user demands poses significant challenges for enhanced and sustainable performance. Energy efficiency (EE) is a critical metric for the sustainable operation of next generation wireless networks. Achieving high EE in dynamic OWC environments, especially under time-varying user distributions and heterogeneous service requirements, remains a complex task. In this work, we formulate a discrete-time EE optimisation problem in a dynamic OWC to maximise energy efficiency through determining user connectivity and power allocation. Solving this problem in real time is computationally demanding due to the coupling of user association and power allocation variables over discrete time slots. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Prediction and Optimised Power Allocation (PDP-OPA) framework which predicts user arrivals, departures, and traffic demands. Based on these predictions, the framework proactively determines AP-user associations and allocates power dynamically using a Lagrangian-based optimisation strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDP-OPA significantly enhances system performance, providing solutions close to the optimal ones. The proposed framework improves energy efficiency, sum rate, and bit error rate (BER) compared to distance-based user association and uniform power allocation, validating its effectiveness for real time and adaptive resource management in dynamic OWC systems.</description>

      <title>Spreading over OFDM for Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) Ranging: Multi-user Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform was proven to be optimal in minimizing ranging sidelobes when random signaling is used. A typical assumption in OFDM-based ranging is that the max target delay is less than the cyclic prefix (CP) length, which is equivalent to performing a \textit{periodic} correlation between the signal reflected from the target and the transmitted signal. In the multi-user case, such as in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), users are assigned disjoint subsets of subcarriers which eliminates mutual interference between the communication channels of the different users. However, ranging involves an aperiodic correlation operation for target ranges with delays greater than the CP length. Aperiodic correlation between signals from disjoint frequency bands will not be zero, resulting in mutual interference between different user bands. We refer to this as \textit{inter-band} (IB) cross-correlation interference. In this work, we analytically characterize IB interference and quantify its impact on the integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). We introduce an orthogonal spreading layer on top of OFDM that can reduce IB interference resulting in ISL levels significantly lower than for OFDM without spreading in the multi-user setup. We validate our claims through simulations, and using an upper bound on IB energy which we show that it can be minimized using our proposed spreading. However, for orthogonal spreading to be effective, a price must be paid in terms of spectral utilization, which is yet another manifestation of the trade-off between sensing accuracy and data communication capacity</description>

      <title>Tri-Hybrid Multi-User Precoding Based on Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tri-hybrid precoding architecture based on electromagnetically reconfigurable antennas (ERAs) is a promising solution for overcoming key limitations in multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. Aiming to further understand its potential, this paper investigates the tri-hybrid multi-user precoding problem using pattern reconfigurable ERAs. To reduce model complexity and improve practicality, we characterize each antenna's radiation pattern using a spherical harmonics decomposition. While mathematically tractable, this approach may lead to over-optimized patterns that are physically unrealizable. To address this, we introduce a projection step that maps the optimized patterns onto a realizable set. Simulation results demonstrate that spherical harmonics-based radiation pattern optimization significantly enhances sum rate performance. However, after projection onto a realizable set obtained from real ERA hardware, the performance gain is notably reduced or even negligible, underscoring the need for more effective projection techniques and improved reconfigurable antenna hardware.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Deep Learning-Empowered Beam Prediction in Future THz ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating at terahertz (THz) bands are envisioned to enable both ultra-high data-rate communication and precise environmental awareness for next-generation wireless networks. However, the narrow width of THz beams makes them prone to misalignment and necessitates frequent beam prediction in dynamic environments. Multimodal sensing, which integrates complementary modalities such as camera images, positional data, and radar measurements, has recently emerged as a promising solution for proactive beam prediction. Nevertheless, existing multimodal approaches typically employ static fusion architectures that cannot adjust to varying modality reliability and contributions, thereby degrading predictive performance and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient multimodal mixture-of-experts (MoE) deep learning framework for proactive beam prediction in THz ISAC systems. The proposed multimodal MoE framework employs multiple modality-specific expert networks to extract representative features from individual sensing modalities, and dynamically fuses them using adaptive weights generated by a gating network according to the instantaneous reliability of each modality. Simulation results in realistic vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MoE framework outperforms traditional static fusion methods and unimodal baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability, highlighting its potential in practical THz ISAC systems with ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Maximization for CR-NOMA based Smart Grid Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing massive data flows effectively and resolving spectrum shortages are two challenges that Smart Grid Communication Networks (SGCN) must overcome. To address these problems, we provide a combined optimization approach that makes use of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technologies. Our work focuses on using user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) techniques to maximize energy efficiency (EE) in SGCN, particularly within Neighbourhood Area Networks (NANs). We develop a joint optimization problem that takes into account the real-world limitations of a CR-NOMA setting. This problem is NP-hard, nonlinear, and nonconvex by nature. To address the computational complexity of the problem, we use the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, which breaks the problem into UP and PA subproblems. Initially, we proposed the Zebra-Optimization User Pairing (ZOUP) algorithm to tackle the UP problem, which outperforms both Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and non-optimized NOMA (UPWO) by 78.8\% and 13.6\%, respectively, at a SNR of 15 dB. Based on the ZOUP pairs, we subsequently proposed the PA approach, i.e., ZOUPPA, which significantly outperforms UPWO and ZOUP by 53.2\% and 25.4\%, respectively, at an SNR of 15 dB. A detailed analysis of key parameters, including varying SNRs, power allocation constants, path loss exponents, user density, channel availability, and coverage radius, underscores the superiority of our approach. By facilitating the effective use of communication resources in SGCN, our research opens the door to more intelligent and energy-efficient grid systems. Our work tackles important issues in SGCN and lays the groundwork for future developments in smart grid communication technologies by combining modern optimization approaches with CR-NOMA.</description>

      <title>Sensing Framework Design and Performance Optimization with Action Detection for ISCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) has been regarded as a prospective technology for the next-generation wireless network, supporting humancentric intelligent applications. However, the delay sensitivity of these computation-intensive applications, especially in a multidevice ISCC system with limited resources, highlights the urgent need for efficient sensing task execution frameworks. To address this, we propose a resource-efficient sensing framework in this paper. Different from existing solutions, it features a novel action detection module deployed at each device to detect the onset of an action. Only time windows filled with signals of interest are offloaded to the edge server and processed by the edge recognition module, thus reducing overhead. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the sensing performance of the proposed sensing framework and formulate a sensing accuracy maximization problem under power, delay, and resource limitations for the multi-device ISCC system. By decomposing it into two subproblems, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed algorithm. It alternatively solves a sensing accuracy maximization subproblem at each device and employs a closed-form computation resource allocation strategy at the edge server till convergence. Finally, a real-world test is conducted using commodity wireless devices to validate the sensing performance analysis. Extensive test results demonstrate that our proposal achieves higher sensing accuracy under the limited resource compared to two baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the channel estimation problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided broadband systems by proposing a dual-structure and multi-dimensional transformations (DS-MDT) algorithm. The proposed approach leverages the dual-structure features of the channel parameters to assist users experiencing weaker channel conditions, thereby enhancing estimation performance. Moreover, given that the channel parameters are distributed across multiple dimensions of the received tensor, the proposed algorithm employs multi-dimensional transformations to effectively isolate and extract distinct parameters. The numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm reduces the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by up to 10 dB while maintaining lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Sensing Safety Analysis for Vehicular Networks with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerged as a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing safety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically adjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular user (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve spoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the RIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect to the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly misled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity estimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can cause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\circ} with only a 5^{\circ} beam misalignment.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Resilient Distributed Single Time-Scale Estimators: A Graph-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed estimation in interconnected systems has gained increasing attention due to its relevance in diverse applications such as sensor networks, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. In real practice, the sensor network may suffer from communication and/or sensor failures. This might be due to cyber-attacks, faults, or environmental conditions. Distributed estimation resilient to such conditions is the topic of this paper. By representing the sensor network as a graph and exploiting its inherent structural properties, we introduce novel techniques that enhance the robustness of distributed estimators. As compared to the literature, the proposed estimator (i) relaxes the network connectivity of most existing single time-scale estimators and (ii) reduces the communication load of the existing double time-scale estimators by avoiding the inner consensus loop.
  On the other hand, the sensors might be subject to faults or attacks, resulting in biased measurements. Removing these sensor data may result in observability loss. Therefore, we propose resilient design on the definitions of $q$-node-connectivity and $q$-link-connectivity, which capture robust strong-connectivity under link or sensor node failure. By proper design of the sensor network, we prove Schur stability of the proposed distributed estimation protocol under failure of up to $q$ sensors or $q$ communication links.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic ODMA Receiver with Low-Complexity Algorithm for MIMO Unsourced Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the design for both pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free on-off multiple access (ODMA) receivers in unsourced random access (URA) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike pilot-coupled ODMA, where on-off patterns are linked to pilot selection, pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free ODMA reduce transmission redundancy but face challenges in processing complexity and capacity performance. The joint pattern and data detector (JPDD) design is critical for these schemes, but the current JPDD algorithm has high complexity with quadratic computational costs. To address this, we propose a low-complexity detector based on approximate message passing (AMP), which offers linear complexity, providing reduced cost and improved performance in the under-determined linear regression case. Decoding is initialized via pilot-free matrix factorization through alternating minimization, resolving phase and scalar ambiguities. Compared to existing pilot-free schemes, the proposed method achieves a 13 dB improvement and favorable trade-offs in complexity and capacity performance when compared to benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Network for Off-Grid Imaging-based Low-Altitude Surveillance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy has emerged as a critical focus for future economic development, emphasizing the urgent need for flight activity surveillance utilizing the existing sensing capabilities of mobile cellular networks. Traditional monostatic or localization-based sensing methods, however, encounter challenges in fusing sensing results and matching channel parameters. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that directly draws the radio images of the low-altitude space, leveraging its inherent sparsity with compressed sensing (CS)-based algorithms and the cooperation of multiple base stations. Furthermore, recognizing that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are randomly distributed in space, we introduce a physics-embedded learning method to overcome off-grid issues inherent in CS-based models. Additionally, an online hard example mining method is incorporated into the design of the loss function, enabling the network to adaptively concentrate on the samples bearing significant discrepancy with the ground truth, thereby enhancing its ability to detect the rare UAVs within the expansive low-altitude space. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the imaging-based low-altitude surveillance approach, with the proposed physics-embedded learning algorithm significantly outperforming traditional CS-based methods under off-grid conditions.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Integrated Communication and Localization with a Single Access Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) not only assist communication but also help the localization of user equipment (UE). This study focuses on the indoor localization of UE with a single access point (AP) aided by multiple RISs. First, we propose a two-stage channel estimation scheme where the phase shifts of RIS elements are tuned to obtain multiple channel soundings. In the first stage, the newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm extracts the parameters of multiple paths from the received signals. Then, the LOS path and RIS-reflected paths are identified. In the second stage, the estimated path gains of RIS-reflected paths with different phase shifts are utilized to determine the angle of arrival (AOA) at the RIS by obtaining the angular pseudo spectrum. Consequently, by taking the AP and RISs as reference points, the linear least squares estimator can locate UE with the estimated AOAs. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can realize centimeter-level localization accuracy in the discussed scenarios. Moreover, the higher accuracy of pseudo spectrum, a larger number of channel soundings, and a larger number of reference points can realize higher localization accuracy of UE.</description>

      <title>Learned Intelligent Recognizer with Adaptively Customized RIS Phases in Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an advanced wireless system that embeds target recognition within reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communication systems, powered by cuttingedge deep learning innovations. Such a system faces the challenge of fine-tuning both the RIS phase shifts and neural network (NN) parameters, since they intricately interdepend on each other to accomplish the recognition task. To address these challenges, we propose an intelligent recognizer that strategically harnesses every piece of prior action responses, thereby ingeniously multiplexing downlink signals to facilitate environment sensing. Specifically, we design a novel NN based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture and the physical channel model. The NN iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements and adaptively customizes RIS configurations to acquire the most relevant information for the recognition task in subsequent moments. Tailored dynamically, these configurations adapt to the scene, task, and target specifics. Simulation results reveal that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, while resulting in minimal impacts on communication performance, even as sensing is performed simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of personalized priors from past MRI scans enables fast, quality-enhanced point-of-care MRI with low-cost systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superb-quality images, but its accessibility is limited by high costs, posing challenges for patients requiring longitudinal care. Low-field MRI provides affordable imaging with low-cost devices but is hindered by long scans and degraded image quality, including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast. We propose a novel healthcare paradigm: using deep learning to extract personalized features from past standard high-field MRI scans and harnessing them to enable accelerated, enhanced-quality follow-up scans with low-cost systems. To overcome the SNR and contrast differences, we introduce ViT-Fuser, a feature-fusion vision transformer that learns features from past scans, e.g. those stored in standard DICOM CDs. We show that \textit{a single prior scan is sufficient}, and this scan can come from various MRI vendors, field strengths, and pulse sequences. Experiments with four datasets, including glioblastoma data, low-field ($50mT$), and ultra-low-field ($6.5mT$) data, demonstrate that ViT-Fuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing enhanced-quality images from accelerated low-field scans, with robustness to out-of-distribution data. Our freely available framework thus enables rapid, diagnostic-quality, low-cost imaging for wide healthcare applications.</description>

Abstract: Advanced neural interfaces are transforming applications ranging from neuroscience research to diagnostic tools (for mental state recognition, tremor and seizure detection) as well as prosthetic devices (for motor and communication recovery). By integrating complex functions into miniaturized neural devices, these systems unlock significant opportunities for personalized assistive technologies and adaptive therapeutic interventions. Leveraging high-density neural recordings, on-site signal processing, and machine learning (ML), these interfaces extract critical features, identify disease neuro-markers, and enable accurate, low-latency neural decoding. This integration facilitates real-time interpretation of neural signals, adaptive modulation of brain activity, and efficient control of assistive devices. Moreover, the synergy between neural interfaces and ML has paved the way for self-sufficient, ubiquitous platforms capable of operating in diverse environments with minimal hardware costs and external dependencies. In this work, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and energy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation miniaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for developing intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in scalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.</description>

      <title>Spacing and Wavelength Tunable Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs are increasingly used in applications such as optical communications, radio signal processing, and dual-comb spectroscopy. Many of these applications require a broad, flat spectrum with tunable center wavelength and tone spacing, while maintaining a consistent spectral profile. However, most existing OFC generators either lack tunability or cannot preserve their spectral shape during tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate a cavity-less OFC system based on an electro-optic comb combined with parametric spectral broadening, achieving tone spacing tunability from 25 to 32 GHz and wavelength tunability from 1548 to 1568 nm. Our OFC features high output power (greater than 2 W), broad bandwidth (greater than 90 nm), high optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR greater than 25 dB), and, critically, a preserved spectral profile. We show that this consistent spectral shape can be maintained by primarily adjusting the RF drive power and the gain of the optical amplifiers. We also provide a quantitative analysis of the spectral profile variations during tuning.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted SWIPT for IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</description>

      <title>Structured Estimators: A New Perspective on Information Freshness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent literature, when modeling for information freshness in remote estimation settings, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators, meaning the remote estimate at any time is equal to the most recently received update. This is mainly due to its simplicity and ease of analysis. However, these martingale estimators are far from optimal in some cases, especially in pull-based update systems. For such systems, maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimum, but can be challenging to analyze. Here, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which retain useful characteristics from a MAP estimate while still being analytically tractable. Our proposed estimators move seamlessly from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator.</description>

      <title>Exploring Challenges in Deep Learning of Single-Station Ground Motion Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have demonstrated promising results across various applications within seismology and earthquake engineering. These models rely primarily on utilizing ground motion records for tasks such as earthquake event classification, localization, earthquake early warning systems, and structural health monitoring. However, the extent to which these models truly extract meaningful patterns from these complex time-series signals remains underexplored. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. Our experimental results reveal a strong dependence on the highly correlated Primary (P) and Secondary (S) phase arrival times. These findings expose a critical gap in the current research landscape, highlighting the lack of robust methodologies for deep learning from single-station ground motion recordings that do not rely on auxiliary inputs.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Design and Bit Allocation in Massive MIMO with Resolution-Adaptive ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as a promising technology for reducing power consumption and complexity in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems while maintaining satisfactory spectral and energy efficiencies (SE/EE). In this work, we first identify the essential properties of optimal quantization and leverage them to derive a closed-form approximation of the covariance matrix of the quantization distortion. The theoretical finding facilitates the system SE analysis in the presence of low-resolution ADCs. We then focus on the joint optimization of the transmit-receive beamforming and bit allocation to maximize the SE under constraints on the transmit power and the total number of active ADC bits. To solve the resulting mixed-integer problem, we first develop an efficient beamforming design for fixed ADC resolutions. Then, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm to iteratively optimize the ADC resolutions and beamforming matrices. Numerical results for a $64 \times 64$ MIMO system demonstrate that the proposed design offers $6\%$ improvement in both SE and EE with $40\%$ fewer active ADC bits compared with the uniform bit allocation. Furthermore, we numerically show that receiving more data streams with low-resolution ADCs can achieve higher SE and EE compared to receiving fewer data streams with high-resolution ADCs.</description>

      <title>Sliding DFT-based Signal Recovery for Modulo ADC with 1-bit Folding Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modulo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to resolve the limited dynamic range (DR) issue of conventional ADCs and achieve an enhanced digital resolution given a fixed quantization bit budget. However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.</description>

      <title>Rotatable and Movable Antenna-Enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the performance of near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems using rotatable movable antennas (RMAs). In the proposed RMA-enabled system, the positions and rotations of antennas at the base station (BS) are dynamically adjusted to enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. Two designs are explored: i) a sensing-centric design that minimizes the Cram$\text{\'e}$r-Rao bound (CRB) with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and ii) a communication-centric design that maximizes the sum-rate with a CRB constraint. To solve the formulated optimization problems, two alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms are proposed capitalizing on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed RMA-enabled system outperforms the conventional fixed-position antenna and non-rotatable movable antenna systems in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs and RMAs' rotations show a higher performance gain in communication-centric design; ii) the proposed optimization methods achieve the Pareto boundary in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a deep learning model based on the U-net architecture to reconstruct missing leads in electrocardiograms (ECGs). The model was trained to reconstruct 12-lead ECG data from reduced lead configurations using publicly available datasets. The results highlight the ability of the model to quantify the information content of each ECG lead and its inter-lead correlations. This has significant implications for optimizing lead selection in diagnostic scenarios, particularly in settings where complete 12-lead ECGs are impractical. In addition, the study provides insights into the physiological underpinnings of ECG signals and their propagation. The findings pave the way for advances in telemedicine, portable ECG devices, and personalized cardiac diagnostics by reducing redundancy and improving signal interpretation.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural OFDM Receivers: Two Novel Architectures for BER-BLER Optimization and Comparison with State-of-the-Art Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural receivers have recently become a popular topic, where the received signals can be directly decoded by data driven mechanisms such as machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models. The computational efficiency of the proposed neural receivers supports their feasibility for next generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Precision yield estimation and mapping in manual strawberry harvesting with instrumented picking carts and a robust data processing pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution yield maps for manually harvested crops are impractical to generate on commercial scales because yield monitors are available only for mechanical harvesters. However, precision crop management relies on accurately determining spatial and temporal yield variability. This study presents the development of an integrated system for precision yield estimation and mapping for manually harvested strawberries. Conventional strawberry picking carts were instrumented with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and load cells to record real-time geo-tagged harvest data and cart motion. Extensive data were collected in two strawberry fields in California, USA, during a harvest season. To address the inconsistencies and errors caused by the sensors and the manual harvesting process, a robust data processing pipeline was developed by integrating supervised deep learning models with unsupervised algorithms. The pipeline was used to estimate the yield distribution and generate yield maps for season-long harvests at the desired grid resolution. The estimated yield distributions were used to calculate two metrics: the total mass harvested over specific row segments and the total mass of trays harvested. The metrics were compared to ground truth and achieved accuracies of 90.48% and 94.05%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy of the estimated yield based on the number of trays harvested per cart for season-long harvest was better than 94%. It showed a strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.99) with the actual number of counted trays in both fields. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical solution for specialty crops, assisting in efficient yield estimation and mapping, field management, and labor management for sustainable crop production.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform Rectangular Index Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In~\cite{sic-magazine-2025}, the authors show that the square index coefficients (SICs) of the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) -- that is, the coefficients $X_{k\sqrt{N}}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, \sqrt{N} - 1$ -- can be losslessly compressed from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$ points, thereby accelerating the computation of these specific DFT coefficients accordingly. Following up on that, in this article we generalize SICs into what we refer to as rectangular index coefficients (RICs) of the DFT, formalized as $X_{kL}, k=0,1,\cdots,C-1$, in which the integers $C$ and $L$ are generic roots of $N$ such that $N=LC$. We present an algorithm to compress the $N$-point input signal $\mathbf{x}$ into a $C$-point signal $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ at the expense of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complex sums and no complex multiplication. We show that a DFT on $\mathbf{\hat{x}}$ is equivalent to a DFT on the RICs of $\mathbf{x}$. In cases where specific frequencies of $\mathbf{x}$ are of interest -- as in harmonic analysis -- one can conveniently adjust the signal parameters (e.g., frequency resolution) to align the RICs with those frequencies, and use the proposed algorithm to compute them significantly faster. If $N$ is a power of two -- as required by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm -- then $C$ can be any power of two in the range $[2, N/2]$ and one can use our algorithm along with FFT to compute all RICs in $\mathcal{O}(C\log C)$ time complexity.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Self-Evolving Channel Twinning: An Ensemble DMD-Assisted Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional channel acquisition faces significant limitations due to ideal model assumptions and scalability challenges. A novel environment-aware paradigm, known as channel twinning, tackles these issues by constructing radio propagation environment semantics using a data-driven approach. In the spotlight of channel twinning technology, a radio map is recognized as an effective region-specific model for learning the spatial distribution of channel information. However, most studies focus on static channel map construction, with only a few collecting numerous channel samples and using deep learning for radio map prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic radio map twinning framework with a substantially small dataset. Specifically, we present an innovative approach that employs dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to model the evolution of the dynamic channel gain map as a dynamical system. We first interpret dynamic channel gain maps as spatio-temporal video stream data. The coarse-grained and fine-grained evolving modes are extracted from the stream data using a new ensemble DMD (Ens-DMD) algorithm. To mitigate the impact of noisy data, we design a median-based threshold mask technique to filter the noise artifacts of the twin maps. With the proposed DMD-based radio map twinning framework, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the low-complexity reproduction and evolution of the channel gain maps. Furthermore, we consider four radio map twin performance metrics to confirm the superiority of our framework compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution Wideband Beam Training for Near-field Communications with Ultra-low Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a super-resolution wideband beam training method for near-field communications, which is able to achieve ultra-low overhead. To this end, we first study the multi-beam characteristic of a sparse uniform linear array (S-ULA) in the wideband. Interestingly, we show that this leads to a new beam pattern property, called rainbow blocks, where the S-ULA generates multiple grating lobes and each grating lobe is further splitted into multiple versions in the wideband due to the well-known beam-split effect. As such, one directional beamformer based on S-ULA is capable of generating multiple rainbow blocks in the wideband, hence significantly extending the beam coverage. Then, by exploiting the beam-split effect in both the frequency and spatial domains, we propose a new three-stage wideband beam training method for extremely large-scale array (XL-array) systems. Specifically, we first sparsely activate a set of antennas at the central of the XL-array and judiciously design the time-delay (TD) parameters to estimate candidate user angles by comparing the received signal powers at the user over subcarriers. Next, to resolve the angular ambiguity introduced by the S-ULA, we activate all antennas in the central subarray and design an efficient subcarrier selection scheme to estimate the true user angle. In the third stage, we resolve the user range at the estimated user angle with high resolution by controlling the splitted beams over subcarriers to simultaneously cover the range domain. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed wideband beam training scheme, which only needs three pilots in near-field beam training, while achieving near-optimal rate performance.</description>

Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology to improve the spectrum efficiency and spatial resolution of future wireless systems. Different from existing works that mostly considered physical layer security (PLS) in either the far-field or near-field, we consider in this paper a new and practical scenario, where legitimate users (Bobs) are located in the far-field of a base station (BS) while eavesdroppers (Eves) are located in the near-field for intercepting confidential information at short distance, referred to as the mixed near-field and far-field PLS. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-secrecy-rate of all Bobs by optimizing the power allocation of the BS, subject to the constraint on the total BS transmit power. To shed useful insights, we first consider a one-Bob-one-Eve system and characterize the insecure-transmission region of the Bob in closed form. Interestingly, we show that the insecure-transmission region is significantly \emph{expanded} as compared to that in conventional far-field PLS systems, due to the energy-spread effect in the mixed-field scenario. Then, we further extend the analysis to a two-Bob-one-Eve system. It is revealed that as compared to the one-Bob system, the interferences from the other Bob can be effectively used to weaken the capability of Eve for intercepting signals of target Bobs, thus leading to enhanced secrecy rates. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution to the formulated non-convex problem by leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves a higher sum-secrecy-rate than the benchmark scheme where the power allocation is designed based on the (simplified) far-field channel model.</description>

      <title>Enhanced RMT estimator for signal number estimation in the presence of colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subspace-based techniques are widely utilized in various scientific fields, and they need accurate estimation of the signal subspace dimension. The classic RMT estimator for model order estimation based on random matrix theory assumes that the noise is white Gaussian, and performs poorly in the presence of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. In the presence of colored noise, the multivariate regression (MV-R) algorithm models the source detection as a multivariate regression problem and infers the model order from the covariance matrix of the residual error. However, the MV-R algorithm requires that the noise is sufficiently weaker than the signal. In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel signal number estimation algorithm in the presence of colored noise based on the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Moreover, a second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the next value of the first criterion, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel enhanced RMT estimator is proposed for signal number estimation by analyzing the detection properties among the signal number estimates obtained by these two criteria, the MV-R estimator and the RMT estimator to sequentially determine whether the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from noise. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the proposed enhanced RMT estimator has better estimation performance than the existing methods.</description>

      <title>GenAINet: Enabling Wireless Collective Intelligence via Knowledge Transfer and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and communication networks are expected to have groundbreaking synergies for 6G. Connecting GenAI agents via a wireless network can potentially unleash the power of Collective Intelligence (CI) and pave the way for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, current wireless networks are designed as a "data pipe" and are not suited to accommodate and leverage the power of GenAI. In this paper, we propose the GenAINet framework in which distributed GenAI agents communicate knowledge (facts, experiences, and methods) to accomplish arbitrary tasks. We first propose an architecture for a single GenAI agent and then provide a network architecture integrating GenAI capabilities to manage both network protocols and applications. Building on this, we investigate effective communication and reasoning problems by proposing a semantic-native GenAINet. Specifically, GenAI agents extract semantics from heterogeneous raw data, build and maintain a knowledge model representing the semantic relationships among pieces of knowledge, which is retrieved by GenAI models for planning and reasoning. Under this paradigm, different levels of collaboration can be achieved flexibly depending on the complexity of targeted tasks. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies in which, through wireless device queries, we demonstrate that extracting, compressing and transferring common knowledge can improve query accuracy while reducing communication costs; and in the wireless power control problem, we show that distributed agents can complete general tasks independently through collaborative reasoning without predefined communication protocols. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research directions in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Time-Constrained Erasure Correction for Data Recovery in UAV-LoRa-WuR Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We described two erasure-correction schemes for data recovery in UAV-LoRa-WuR networks. Our results show that unless the maximum number for redundant frames a sensor can send per data-collection cycle is very small, erasure coding provides noticeable improvements over an uncoded transmissions. Whether to employ coding -- and if so, which type -- should be determined based on the sensors' energy budget (which dictates the maximum redundancy), the UAV's hovering time, and the node density. The analytical framework presented above aids in this decision making.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</description>

      <title>AFDM Channel Estimation in Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) is a brand new chirp-based multi-carrier (MC) waveform for high mobility communications, with promising advantages over Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and other MC waveforms. Existing AFDM research focuses on wireless communication at high carrier frequency (CF), which typically considers only Doppler frequency shift (DFS) as a result of mobility, while ignoring the accompanied Doppler time scaling (DTS) on waveform. However, for underwater acoustic (UWA) communication at much lower CF and propagating at speed of sound, the DTS effect could not be ignored and poses significant challenges for channel estimation. This paper analyzes the channel frequency response (CFR) of AFDM under multi-scale multi-lag (MSML) channels, where each propagating path could have different delay and DFS/DTS. Based on the newly derived input-output formula and its characteristics, two new channel estimation methods are proposed, i.e., AFDM with iterative multi-index (AFDM-IMI) estimation under low to moderate DTS, and AFDM with orthogonal matching pursuit (AFDM-OMP) estimation under high DTS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods against the original AFDM channel estimation method. Moreover, the resulted AFDM system outperforms OFDM as well as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) in terms of channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER), which is consistent with our theoretical analysis based on CFR overlap probability (COP), mutual incoherent property (MIP) and channel diversity gain under MSML channels.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</description>

      <title>Freezing of Gait Detection Using Gramian Angular Fields and Federated Learning from Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease that impairs mobility and safety by increasing the risk of falls. An effective FOG detection system must be accurate, real-time, and deployable in free-living environments to enable timely interventions. However, existing detection methods face challenges due to (1) intra- and inter-patient variability, (2) subject-specific training, (3) using multiple sensors in FOG dominant locations (e.g., ankles) leading to high failure points, (4) centralized, non-adaptive learning frameworks that sacrifice patient privacy and prevent collaborative model refinement across populations and disease progression, and (5) most systems are tested in controlled settings, limiting their real-world applicability for continuous in-home monitoring. Addressing these gaps, we present FOGSense, a real-world deployable FOG detection system designed for uncontrolled, free-living conditions using only a single sensor. FOGSense uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and privacy-preserving federated deep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by traditional methods with a low false positive rate. We evaluated our system using a public Parkinson's dataset collected in a free-living environment. FOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces failure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to missing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation and efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it effective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense achieved a 22.2% improvement in F1-score and a 74.53% reduction in false positive rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced sensitivity for FOG episode detection.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.</description>

      <title>AoI in Context-Aware Hybrid Radio-Optical IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the surge in IoT devices ranging from wearables to smart homes, prompt transmission is crucial. The Age of Information (AoI) emerges as a critical metric in this context, representing the freshness of the information transmitted across the network. This paper studies hybrid IoT networks that employ Optical Communication (OC) as a reinforcement medium to Radio Frequency (RF). We formulate a non-linear convex optimization that adopts a multi-objective optimization strategy to dynamically schedule the communication between devices and select their corresponding communication technology, aiming to balance the maximization of network throughput with the minimization of energy usage and the frequency of switching between technologies. To mitigate the impact of dominant sub-objectives and their scale disparity, the designed approach employs a regularization method that approximates adequate sub-objective scaling weights. Simulation results show that the OC supplementary integration alongside RF enhances the network's overall performances and significantly reduces the Mean AoI and Peak AoI, allowing the collection of the freshest possible data using the best available communication technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.</description>

      <title>Mind2Matter: Creating 3D Models from EEG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of 3D objects from brain signals has gained significant attention in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Current research predominantly utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its excellent spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of fMRI is limited by its prohibitive costs and inability to support real-time operations. In comparison, electroencephalography (EEG) presents distinct advantages as an affordable, non-invasive, and mobile solution for real-time brain-computer interaction systems. While recent advances in deep learning have enabled remarkable progress in image generation from neural data, decoding EEG signals into structured 3D representations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that translates EEG recordings into 3D object reconstructions by leveraging neural decoding techniques and generative models. Our approach involves training an EEG encoder to extract spatiotemporal visual features, fine-tuning a large language model to interpret these features into descriptive multimodal outputs, and leveraging generative 3D Gaussians with layout-guided control to synthesize the final 3D structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model captures salient geometric and semantic features, paving the way for applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), virtual reality, and neuroprosthetics.

      <title>SA-MIMO: Scalable Quantum-Based Wireless Communications</title>

Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers offer a quantum-native alternative to conventional RF front-ends by directly detecting electromagnetic fields via highly excited atomic states. While their quantum-limited sensitivity and hardware simplicity make them promising for future wireless systems, extending their use to scalable multi-antenna and multi-carrier configurations, termed Scalable Atomic-MIMO (SA-MIMO), remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel RF transmitter-atomic receiver architecture that addresses this gap. The core idea lies in a novel modulation technique called Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading (PRSS), which transforms the nonlinear phase retrieval problem inherent to atomic detection into a tractable linear demultiplexing task. PRSS enables efficient signal processing and supports scalable MUX/DeMUX operations in both atomic MIMO and atomic OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves up to 2.5 dB gain under optimal maximum-likelihood detection and over 10 dB under suboptimal detection in MIMO settings. These results establish PRSS assisted SA-MIMO as a promising architecture for realizing high-sensitivity, interference-resilient atomic wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.</description>
