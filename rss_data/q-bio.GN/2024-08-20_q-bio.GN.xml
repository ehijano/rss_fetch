      <title>Meta-Learning on Augmented Gene Expression Profiles for Enhanced Lung Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene expression profiles obtained through DNA microarray have proven successful in providing critical information for cancer detection classifiers. However, the limited number of samples in these datasets poses a challenge to employ complex methodologies such as deep neural networks for sophisticated analysis. To address this "small data" dilemma, Meta-Learning has been introduced as a solution to enhance the optimization of machine learning models by utilizing similar datasets, thereby facilitating a quicker adaptation to target datasets without the requirement of sufficient samples. In this study, we present a meta-learning-based approach for predicting lung cancer from gene expression profiles. We apply this framework to well-established deep learning methodologies and employ four distinct datasets for the meta-learning tasks, where one as the target dataset and the rest as source datasets. Our approach is evaluated against both traditional and deep learning methodologies, and the results show the superior performance of meta-learning on augmented source data compared to the baselines trained on single datasets. Moreover, we conduct the comparative analysis between meta-learning and transfer learning methodologies to highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges associated with limited sample sizes. Finally, we incorporate the explainability study to illustrate the distinctiveness of decisions made by meta-learning.</description>

      <title>On the importance of assessing topological convergence in Bayesian phylogenetic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern phylogenetics research is often performed within a Bayesian framework, using sampling algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior distribution. These algorithms require careful evaluation of the quality of the generated samples. Within the field of phylogenetics, one frequently adopted diagnostic approach is to evaluate the effective sample size (ESS) and to investigate trace graphs of the sampled parameters. A major limitation of these approaches is that they are developed for continuous parameters and therefore incompatible with a crucial parameter in these inferences: the tree topology. Several recent advancements have aimed at extending these diagnostics to topological space. In this reflection paper, we present two case studies - one on Ebola virus and one on HIV - illustrating how these topological diagnostics can contain information not found in standard diagnostics, and how decisions regarding which of these diagnostics to compute can impact inferences regarding MCMC convergence and mixing. Our results show the importance of running multiple replicate analyses and of carefully assessing topological convergence using the output of these replicate analyses. To this end, we illustrate different ways of assessing and visualizing the topological convergence of these replicates. Given the major importance of detecting convergence and mixing issues in Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, the lack of a unified approach to this problem warrants further action, especially now that additional tools are becoming available to researchers.</description>
