      <title>Increased lifespan for 3D compressible Euler flows with rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Euler equation with a Coriolis term and prove a lower bound on the time of existence of solutions in terms of the speed of rotation, sound speed and size of the initial data. Along the way, we obtain precise dispersive decay estimates for the linearized equation. In the incompressible limit, this improves current bounds for the incompressible Euler-Coriolis system as well.</description>

      <title>On the Landis Conjecture for Positive Quasi-linear Operators on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Landis type unique continuation result for positive quasi-linear operators on graphs. Specifically, we give decay criteria that ensures when a harmonic function for a positive quasilinear Schr\"odinger operator with potential less than 1 is trivially zero. The assumption of positivity of the operator allows the application of criticality theory such as the Liouville comparison theorem. Furthermore, our results fundamentally build on the so called simplified energy. As an application we discuss the case of model graphs and in particular regular trees.</description>

      <title>Extended Sobolev Scale on Non-Compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting the definition of ``extended Sobolev scale" on compact manifolds by Mikhailets and Murach to the setting of a (generally non-compact) manifold of bounded geometry $X$, we define the ``extended Sobolev scale" $H^{\varphi}(X)$, where $\varphi$ is a function which is $RO$-varying at infinity. With the help of the scale $H^{\varphi}(X)$, we obtain a description of all Hilbert function-spaces that serve as interpolation spaces with respect to a pair of Sobolev spaces $[H^{(s_0)}(X), H^{(s_1)}(X)]$, with $s_0&lt;s_1$. We use this interpolation property to establish a mapping property of proper uniform pseudo-differential operators (PUPDOs) in the context of the scale $H^{\varphi}(X)$. Additionally, using a first-order positive-definite PUPDO $A$ of elliptic type we define the ``extended $A$-scale" $H^{\varphi}_{A}(X)$ and show that it coincides, up to norm equivalence, with the scale $H^{\varphi}(X)$. Besides the mentioned results, we show that further properties of the $H^{\varphi}$-scale, originally established by Mikhailets and Murach on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on compact manifolds, carry over to manifolds of bounded geometry.</description>

      <title>State-Constrained Chemical Reactions: Discrete-to-Continuous Hamilton--Jacobi Equations and Large Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the macroscopic behavior of chemical reactions modeled as random time-changed Poisson processes on discrete state spaces. Using the WKB reformulation, the backward equation of the rescaled process leads to a discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equation with state constraints. As the grid size tends to zero, the limiting solution and its associated variational representation are closely connected to the good rate function of the large deviation principle for state-constrained chemical reactions in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we focus on the limiting behavior of discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equations defined on bounded domains with state-constraint boundary conditions. For a single chemical reaction, we show that, under a suitable reparametrization, the solution of the discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equation converges to the solution of a continuous Hamilton--Jacobi equation with a Neumann boundary condition. Building on this convergence result and the associated variational representation, we establish the large deviation principle for the rescaled chemical reaction process in bounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac operator with MIT bag boundary condition in a bounded convex domain is shown to be always self-adjoint in the $H^1$-setting. This allows one to show that such operators appear as limit of Dirac operators with large positive mass outside the domain. Similar results were previously known for smooth domains only.</description>

      <title>A nonlocal Aw-Rascle-Zhang system with linear pressure term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlocal extension of the Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model, where the pressure-like term is modeled as a convolution between vehicle density and a kernel function. This formulation captures nonlocal driver interactions and aligns structurally with the Euler-alignment system studied in [23]. Using a sticky particle approximation, we construct entropy solutions to the equation for the cumulative density and prove convergence of approximate solutions to weak solutions of the nonlocal system. The analysis includes well-posedness, stability estimates, and an entropic selection principle.</description>

      <title>Graphical Willmore Problems with Low-Regularity Boundary and Dirichlet Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish existence and regularity results for boundary value problems arising from the first variation of the Willmore energy in the graphical setting. Our focus lies on two-dimensional surfaces with fixed clamped boundary conditions, embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and represented as graphs of height functions over domains with non-smooth boundaries. Our approach involves constructing solutions through linearization and a fixed-point argument, requiring small boundary data in suitable functional spaces. Building on the results of Koch and Lamm \cite{koch2012geometric}, we rewrite the Willmore equation for graphs in a divergence form that allows the application of weighted second-order Sobolev spaces. This reformulation significantly weakens the regularity assumptions on both the boundary and the Dirichlet data, reducing them to the $C^{1+\alpha}$-class, while the solution remains smooth in the interior. Moreover, we extend the existence theory to domains with merely Lipschitz boundaries within a purely weighted Sobolev framework. Our approach is also applicable to other higher-order geometric PDEs, including the graphical Helfrich and surface diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>The Incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier Limits from Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac Equation for Low Regularity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic limits of the quantum Boltzmann equation with Fermi-Dirac statistics for hard sphere and hard potentials in the whole space. By analyzing the spectrum of the linearized collision operator combined with the transport operator and its associated semigroup, the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier limits from the BFD equation is verified rigorously. Compared to the results in [Jiang-Xiong-Zhou,J. Differ. Equ.,2022], this paper works with a lower regularity for the initial data. In addition, the fixed-point arguments together with a time iteration ensure us to obtain the lifespan of kinetic solution coincides with those of limiting fluid solution.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic instability for the forced Navier--Stokes equations in critical Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic stability is one of the classical problems in the field of mathematical analysis of fluid mechanics. In $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 3$, it is easily proved by the standard argument that if the given small external force decays at temporal infinity, then the small forced Navier--Stokes flow also strongly converges to zero as time tends to infinity in the framework of the critical Besov spaces $\dot{B}_{p,q}^{n/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $1 \leq p &lt; n$ and $1 \leq q &lt; \infty$. In the present paper, we show that this asymptotic stability fails for $p \geq n$ with $n \geq 3$ in the sense that there exist arbitrary small external forces whose critical Besov norm decays in large time, whereas the corresponding Navier--Stokes flows oscillate and do not strongly converge as $t \to \infty$ in the framework of the critical Besov spaces $\dot{B}_{p,q}^{n/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Moreover, we find that the situation is different in the two-dimensional case $n=2$ and show the forced Navier--Stokes flow is asymptotically unstable in $\dot{B}_{p,1}^{2/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for all $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Our instability does not appear in the linear level but is caused by the nonlinear interaction from external forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A case can be made that the utility of quasi-linear systems of conservation laws as physical models is largely limited to Euler system models of fluid flow, at least in higher dimensions. Qualified corroboration of this conjecture is obtained here, by attempt to extend the class of systems attractive as physical models via the associated symmetry group.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to equilibrium of conservative dynamics II: non-gradient exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the speed-change exclusion process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ reversible with respect to the product Bernoulli measure, we prove that its semigroup $P_t$ satisfies a variance decay $\operatorname{Var}[P_t u] = C_u t^{-\frac{d}{2}} + o(t^{-\frac{d+\delta}{2}})$ for every local function $u$, with the constant $C_u$ explicitly characterized. This extends the result of Janvresse, Landim, Quastel and Yau in [Ann. Probab. 27(1) 325--360, 1999] to a non-gradient model. The proof combines the regularization argument in the previous work, and the chaos expansion in [Markov Process. Related Fields, 5(2) 125--162, 1999] by Bertini and Zegarlinski, via a new input from the homogenization theory.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulation of a Fluid-Heat System in a Thin, Rough Layer in Contact With a Solid Bulk Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effective coupling between heat and fluid dynamics within a thin fluid layer in contact with a solid structure via a rough surface. Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Equation for the Lorenz Curve: Dynamics of incomplete moments of probability distributions arising from Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.</description>

Abstract: We study elliptic and parabolic systems in divergence form with degenerate or singular coefficients. Under the conormal boundary condition on the flat boundary, we establish boundary Schauder type estimates when the coefficients have partially Dini mean oscillation. Moreover, as an application, we achieve $k^{\text{th}}$ higher-order boundary Harnack principles for uniformly parabolic equations with H\"older coefficients, extending a recent result in [Audrito-Fioravanti-Vita 25] from $k\ge2$ to any $k\ge1$.</description>

      <title>A new asymptotic regime for the KdV equation with Wigner-von Neumann type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the KdV equation, focusing on the evolution of the radiant wave associated with a Wigner-von Neumann (WvN) resonance induced by the initial data (potential). A WvN resonance refers to an energy level where the potential exhibits zero transmission (complete reflection). The corresponding Jost solution at such energy becomes singular, and in the NLS context, this is referred to as a spectral singularity. A WvN resonance represents a long-range phenomenon, often introducing significant challenges, such as an infinite negative spectrum, when employing the inverse scattering transform (IST). To avoid some of these issues, we consider a restricted class of initial data that generates a WvN resonance but for which the IST framework can be suitably adapted. For this class of potentials, we demonstrate that each WvN resonance produces a distinct asymptotic regime -- termed the resonance regime -- characterized by a slower decay rate for large time compared to the radiant waves associated with short-range initial data.</description>

      <title>Mass-Critical Neutron Stars in the Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states of neutron stars and white dwarfs in the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theories. It is known that the system is stable below a critical mass, which depends on the gravitational constant, while it becomes unstable if the total mass exceeds the critical mass. We prove that if the total mass is at the critical mass, then the HFB minimizers do not exist for any gravitational constant, while the HF minimizers exist for every gravitational constant except for a countable set, which is fully characterized by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for orthonormal systems. Our results complement the existence results in the sub-critical mass case established in [E. Lenzmann and M. Lewin, Duke Math. J., 2010].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the essential connection of the parabolic inertia Lam\'{e} equations and Navier-Stokes equations, we prove the existence of smooth solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ by showing the existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions of the parabolic inertia Lam\'{e} equations and by letting a Lam\'{e} constant $\lambda$ tends to infinity (the other Lam\'{e} constant $\mu&gt;0$ is fixed).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the approach of Brezis and Lieb, we prove the existence of a ground state solution for the biharmonic nonlinear vector field equations in the limiting case of space dimension $4$. Our results complete those obtained by Mederski and Siemianowski for dimensions $d\geq 5$. We also extend the biharmonic logarithmic Sobolev inequality to dimension $4$.</description>

      <title>Global existence of the irrotational Euler-Norstrom equations with a positive cosmological constant: The gravitational field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our objective is to demonstrate the global existence of classical solutions for the nonlinear irrotational Euler-Nordstroem system, which includes a linear equation of state and a cosmological constant. In this framework, the gravitational field is represented by a single scalar function that satisfies a specific semi-linear wave equation. We focus on spatially periodic deviations from the background metric, which is why we study the semi-linear wave equation on the three-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ within the Sobolev spaces $H^m(\mathbb{T}^3)$. This work is divided into two parts. First, we examine the Nordstroem equation with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid governed by a linear equation of state. In the second part, we analyze the full coupled system. One reason for this separation is that an irrotational fluid with a linear equation of state introduces a source term for the Nordstroem equation containing a nonlinear term of fractional order. This nonlinearity precludes the direct application of the techniques used in our earlier work \cite{Brauer_Karp_23}, where we relied on symmetric hyperbolic systems, energy estimates, and homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Instead, we develop an appropriate energy functional and establish the corresponding energy estimates tailored to the wave equation under consideration.</description>

      <title>Compactness and least energy solutions to the super-Liouville equation on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.</description>

      <title>Long-wave instability of periodic shear flows for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1959, Kolmogorov proposed to study the instability of the shear flow $(\sin(y),0)$ in the vanishing viscosity regime in tori $\mathbb{T}_{\alpha}\times \mathbb{T}$. This question was later resolved by Meshalkin and Sinai. We extend the problem to general shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and show that every $U(y)$ exhibits long-wave instability whenever $\|\partial_y^{-1} U\|_{L^2} &gt; \nu$ and $\alpha\ll \nu$, with $\nu$ being the kinematic viscosity. This instability mechanism confirms previous findings by Yudovich in 1966, supported also by several numerical results, and is established through two independent approaches: one via the construction of Kato's isomorphism and one via normal forms. Unlike in many other applications of the latter methods, both proofs deal with the presence of a delicate term in the linearized operator that becomes singular as $\alpha$ approaches $0$.</description>
