      <title>Classical periodic orbits in extended phase space for spherical harmonic oscillator with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete analysis of classical periodic orbits (POs) and their bifurcations was conducted in spherical harmonic oscillator system with spin-orbit coupling. The motion of the spin is explicitly considered using the spin canonical variables derived by semiclassical approximation to the spin coherent state path integral representation. In addition to the diametric and two circular PO families with frozen spin, solutions that bridge two circular POs are found in which orbital motion is coupled to spin precession. In addition, each bridge encounters a secondary bifurcation on the way from one circular PO to the other and generates a new PO, that survives at higher energies while maintaining a constant period. The generic expressions for those POs are obtained explicitly, and all the above peculiar bifurcation scenarios are described fully analytically.</description>

      <title>Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.</description>

      <title>ComplexityMeasures.jl: scalable software to unify and accelerate entropy and complexity timeseries analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the nonlinear timeseries analysis literature, countless quantities have been presented as new ``entropy'' or ``complexity'' measures, often with similar roles. The ever-increasing pool of such measures makes creating a sustainable and all-encompassing software for them difficult both conceptually and pragmatically. Such a software however would be an important tool that can aid researchers make an informed decision of which measure to use and for which application, as well as accelerate novel research. Here we present {ComplexityMeasures.jl}, an easily extendable and highly performant open-source software that implements a vast selection of complexity measures. The software provides 1638 measures with 3,841 lines of source code, averaging only 2.3 lines of code per exported quantity (version 3.7). This is made possible by its mathematically rigorous composable design. In this paper we discuss the software design and demonstrate how it can accelerate complexity-related research in the future. We carefully compare it with alternative software and conclude that {ComplexityMeasures.jl} outclasses the alternatives in several objective aspects of comparison, such as computational performance, overall amount of measures, reliability, and extendability. {ComplexityMeasures.jl} is also a component of the {DynamicalSystems.jl} library for nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear timeseries analysis and follows open source development practices for creating a sustainable community of developers and contributors.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaos on the excited-state quantum phase transition of the Kerr parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The driven Kerr parametric oscillator, of interest to fundamental physics and quantum technologies, exhibits an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) originating in an unstable classical periodic orbit. The main signature of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are useful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the cat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of theoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever larger nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>An Analysis Framework for Understanding Deep Neural Networks Based on Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancing artificial intelligence demands a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying deep learning. Here, we propose a straightforward analysis framework based on the dynamics of learning models. Neurons are categorized into two modes based on whether their transformation functions preserve order. This categorization reveals how deep neural networks (DNNs) maximize information extraction by rationally allocating the proportion of neurons in different modes across deep layers. We further introduce the attraction basins of the training samples in both the sample vector space and the weight vector space to characterize the generalization ability of DNNs. This framework allows us to identify optimal depth and width configurations, providing a unified explanation for fundamental DNN behaviors such as the "flat minima effect," "grokking," and double descent phenomena. Our analysis extends to networks with depths up to 100 layers.</description>
