      <title>200,000+ Deep Learning Inferred Periods of Stellar Variability from The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions, however these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1-30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giants stars which correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry and may prove useful for upcoming observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</description>

      <title>The effect of collisional cooling of energetic electrons on radio emission from the centrifugal magnetospheres of magnetic hot stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends our previous study of gyro-emission by energetic electrons in the magnetospheres of rapidly rotating, magnetic massive stars, through a quantitative analysis of the role of Coulomb collisions with thermal electrons from stellar wind material trapped within the centrifugal magnetosphere (CM). For a dipolar field with aligned magnetic and rotational axes, we show that both gyro-cooling along magnetic loops and Coulomb cooling in the CM layer have nearly the same dependence on the magnitude and radial variation of magnetic field, implying that their ratio is a global parameter that is largely independent of the field. Analytic analysis shows that, for electrons introduced near the CM layer around a magnetic loop apex, collisional cooling is more important for electrons with high pitch angle, while more field-aligned electrons cool by gyro-emission near their mirror point close to the loop base. Numerical models that assume a gyrotropic initial deposition with a gaussian distribution in both radius and loop co-latitude show the residual gyro-emission is generally strongest near the loop base, with highly relativistic electrons suffering much lower collisional losses than lower-energy electrons that are only mildly relativistic. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential applicability of this formalism to magnetic ultracool dwarfs, for which VLBI observations indicate incoherent radio emission to be concentrated around the magnetic equator, in contrast to our predictions here for magnetic hot stars. We suggest that this difference could be attributed to either a lower ambient density of thermal electrons, or more highly relativistic non-thermal electrons, both of which would reduce the relative importance of the collisional cooling explored here.</description>

      <title>The first stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic activity and differential rotation of HIP12653</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of HIP12653 to investigate its magnetic cycle and differential rotation. Using HARPS archival spectra matched with MARCS-AMBER theoretical templates, we derive the stellar parameters (Teff, logg, FeH, and vsini) of the target. The S-index, an activity indicator based on the emission of the CaII H&amp;K lines, is fitted to determine the magnetic cycle and rotation periods. We refine the magnetic cycle period to 5799.20 \pm 0.88 d and suggest the existence of a secondary, shorter cycle of 674.6922 \pm 0.0098 d, making HIP12653 the youngest star known to exhibit such a short activity cycle. During the minimum activity phase, a rotation period of 4.8 d is estimated. This is notably different from the 7-day period obtained when measurements during minimum activity are excluded, suggesting that these two periods are rotation periods at different latitudes. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce a novel light curve fitting method that incorporates multiple harmonics to model different spot configurations. Applied to synthetic light curves, the method recovers at least two rotation periods close to the true input values in 92.1% of cases. The inferred rotation shear shows a median deviation of 0.0011 \pm 0.0003 and a standard deviation of 0.0177 \pm 0.0002 from the true value. Applying this approach to TESS photometric data from 2018 to 2023, we detect three distinct rotation periods, 4.8 d, 5.7 d, and 7.7 d, (along with a signal at 3.75 d interpreted as its first harmonic), consistent with spots located at different latitudes. Assuming a solar-like differential rotation, we estimate an inclination of 34.0 \pm 1.8^\circ and a rotational shear of \alpha = 0.38 \pm 0.01. These results confirm the 4.8-d period and demonstrate that differential rotation can be constrained by tracking rotation period changes across different phases of the magnetic cycle.</description>

      <title>Radial pulsation runaway in massive red supergiants in late evolutionary stage and implications to hydrogen-rich supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing a series of hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary simulations with \textsc{Mesa} (Module for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we investigate the excitation and growth of radial pulsations of massive red supergiants (RSGs) with the initial mass range of $M_\mathrm{ini}=13$--$18\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We show that strong radial pulsations develop in the hydrogen-rich envelope in their late evolutionary stages, and eventually the surface radial velocity exceeds the escape velocity for higher-mass models. On the other hand, lower-mass models exhibit more moderate pulsations with finite velocity amplitudes and are expected to keep massive hydrogen-rich envelopes when they evolve toward the gravitational collapse of the iron core. While the latter group ends up as a familiar transient population of exploding RSGs, i.e., type IIP supernovae (SNe), the former group may expel a part of their envelopes and explode as different transients population. We investigate how the energy of the oscillating envelope is dissipated and released as radiation. We also empirically determine the condition for the pulsation-driven mass ejection in terms of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M&gt;10^{3.9}\mathrm{L}_\odot/\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The corresponding luminosity threshold for the explored mass range may explain the observationally inferred constraints on type IIP SN progenitors.</description>

      <title>Turn up the light: Radiative efficiency of protostars at birth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early stages of stellar birth comprise of a two-step process involving the formation of two hydrostatic cores. The second step of gravitational collapse sets the radiative efficiency and accretion rate of the young protostar. These two parameters, of prime importance for protostellar evolution, dictate the luminosities and thus play a key role in deciphering the current discrepancy between observational surveys and theoretical models. In this letter, we provide quantitative estimates on the evolution of the radiative efficiency and accretion rate obtained from self-consistent, high-resolution, radiative hydrodynamic simulations performed using the codes PLUTO and RAMSES. The main highlight of our result is that the radiative efficiency reaches unity, that is, supercriticality, relatively quickly after protostellar birth. Supercriticality at the accretion shock is a necessary condition for cold accretion. Our results thus support a rapid transition to the cold accretion scenario, which is one of the assumptions used in Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) models working towards solutions to explain observational data. We briefly discuss the implications of the time evolution of the radiative efficiency factor in the context of the luminosity problem, the Protostellar Luminosity Function (PLF), PMS evolution, accurate sink properties, and the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).</description>

      <title>Detection of kink oscillations in solar coronal loops by a CNN-LSTM neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid machine learning model which combines a shallow convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network (CNN--LSTM), has been developed to automate the detection of kink oscillations in coronal plasma loops within large volumes of high-cadence sequences of imaging data. The network was trained on a set of 10,000 synthetic data cubes designed to mimic sequences of coronal images, achieving an accuracy greater than 98\% on this synthetic dataset. The model was then applied to detect kink oscillations in real data cubes of coronal active regions observed with SDO/AIA in the 171~\AA\ channel. This dataset consisted of 50 samples with visually detected kink oscillations and 128 samples without. Each sample covered an area of 260$\times$260~pixels in the spatial domain and a duration of 30~min with a 12~s cadence in the time domain. Both off-limb and on-disk regions of interest were used. The data were pre-processed by median filtering in the time domain, and Gaussian smoothing and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization in the spatial domain. In the real dataset, the performance of the model was 83.7\%.The model is fully available in open access. We regard the CNN--LSTM model developed as a first step toward creating robust tools for routine solar coronal data mining in the context of coronal oscillation study.</description>

      <title>V659 Cen: System Parameters Updated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V659 Cen is a classical Cepheid which is part of a multiple system. Previous observations have shown that a hot companion dominates an ultraviolet spectrum and a cooler main sequence star dominates an XMM-Newton spectrum. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra discussed here spatially resolve the components and show that the secondary in the spectroscopic binary with the Cepheid is the low mass star, and the hottest star in the system is the outer companion. In addition a fourth star is a likely member of the system based on Gaia data. A new orbit is derived which includes new radial velocities.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES). IV. Surface Gravity Estimation and Giant-Dwarf Separation with the DDO51 Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable estimation of stellar surface gravity (log $g$) for a large sample is crucial for evaluating stellar evolution models and understanding galactic structure; However, it is not easy to accomplish due to the difficulty in gathering a large spectroscopic data set. Photometric sky survey using a specific filter, on the other hand, can play a substantial role in the assessment of log $g$. The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) utilizes eight filters to provide accurate stellar parameters for $\sim10^{7}$ stars, with its DDO51 intermediate-band filter specifically designed for robust log $g$ determination. In this work, the observed SAGES $u_{\rm SC}$ and $v_{\rm SAGES}$ photometry, the synthetic photometry in $g$, $r$, $i$, and DDO51 bands derived from \textit{Gaia} XP spectra are employed to investigate the importance of the DDO51 filter in the determination of log $g$. We applied machine-learning-based extinction correction and employed XGBoost models, trained on stellar parameters from LAMOST, to predict log $g$ using photometric data. By comparing model predicted log $g$ with LAMOST values, we find that including DDO51 filter improve the accuracies of log $g$ estimates by 21.0\% (from 0.224\,dex to 0.177\,dex) overall, and by 26.5\% (from 0.302\,dex to 0.222\,dex ) for GK-type stars, as compared to those obtained without DDO51. The DDO51 filter is also validated to be particularly effective for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$&lt;$-1.0), where it significantly mitigates systematic biases. Our findings highlight the diagnostic power of the SAGES DDO51 filter, providing enhanced stellar characterization vital for future in-depth studies of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission is a NASA Small Explorer to determine the cross-scale processes that unify the solar corona and heliosphere. PUNCH has two science objectives: (1) understand how coronal structures become the ambient solar wind, and (2) understand the dynamic evolution of transient structures, such as coronal mass ejections, in the young solar wind. To address these objectives, PUNCH uses a constellation of four small spacecraft in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, to collect linearly polarized images of the K corona and young solar wind. The four spacecraft each carry one visible-light imager in a 1+3 configuration: a single Narrow Field Imager solar coronagraph captures images of the outer corona at all position angles, and at solar elongations from 1.5{\deg} (6 R$_\odot$) to 8{\deg} (32 R$_\odot$); and three separate Wide Field Imager heliospheric imagers together capture views of the entire inner solar system, at solar elongations from 3{\deg} (12 R$_\odot$) to 45{\deg} (180 R$_\odot$) from the Sun. PUNCH images include linear-polarization data, to enable inferring the three-dimensional structure of visible features without stereoscopy. The instruments are matched in wavelength passband, support overlapping instantaneous fields of view, and are operated synchronously, to act as a single ``virtual instrument'' with a 90{\deg} wide field of view, centered on the Sun. PUNCH launched in March of 2025 and began science operations in June of 2025. PUNCH has an open data policy with no proprietary period, and PUNCH Science Team Meetings are open to all.</description>

      <title>Gaia DR3 Variable White Dwarfs vetted by ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The publications of Gaia DR2 and DR3 have brought major improvements in stellar astrometry and photometry, particularly regarding the description of the white dwarf sequence. Notably, Gaia DR2 enabled the detection of variability in white dwarfs based solely on averaged astrometric and photometric quantities, i.e. the astrometric 5 parameters (positions, proper motion, and parallax) and general photometry properties in the G, BP and RP bands (mean, standard deviation and number of measurements). We identify and classify variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 data and Zwicky Transient Facility DR23 observations. The objective is to construct a catalogue of pulsating white dwarf candidates with robust selection criteria. We define a new sample of candidate variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data. We cross-match this sample with the ZTF DR23 catalogue and apply a multiband Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to detect periodic variability. We then use the OPTICS unsupervised clustering algorithm to to group and classify the confirmed periodic stars. We identify 1423 variable white dwarfs candidates from Gaia DR3, with 864 having ZTF time series. 141 present significant periodicity. We classify these objects into known categories, including ZZ Ceti stars, GW Vir, V777 Her, and white dwarf-main sequence binaries. Our analysis yields several periodic stars, including three ZZ Ceti, 15 GW Vir, one V777 Her, and 24 WD-MS binaries. Furthermore, it reveals a significant population of potentialy variable stars, though without confirmed periodicity. Finally we publish our catalogue of candidate variable white dwarfs including variability status, periodicity, and classification information for the 864 sources with ZTF time series, 519 of them newly identified (including 83 new periodic stars).</description>

Abstract: In this study, we examined the nearby open clusters (OCs) Alessi 36 and Collinder 135. Their spatial proximity was assessed using photometric and astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR3. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), yielding 230 members for Alessi 36 and 342 members for Collinder 135. The mean proper-motion components ($\mu_\alpha \cos\delta, \mu_\delta$) were determined as $(-9.681 \pm 0.072, 7.021 \pm 0.081)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Alessi 36 and $(-10.061 \pm 0.083, 6.256 \pm 0.095)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Collinder 135. The parallax-based distances ($d$) were found to be $278 \pm 7$ and $299 \pm 11$ pc, while their estimated ages ($t$) were $39 \pm 5$ and $36 \pm 5$ Myr for Alessi 36 and Collinder 135, respectively. The Galactic orbital analysis of Alessi 36 and Collinder 135 reveals nearly circular orbits with low eccentricities and minor fluctuations in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. The maximum heights they attain above the Galactic plane are $0.035 \pm 0.001$ kpc for Alessi 36 and $0.074 \pm 0.003$ kpc for Collinder 135, supporting their classification as part of the young stellar disc population.</description>

      <title>The cosmic journey of dust grains - from nucleation to planetary system</title>

Abstract: Dust is essential to the evolution of galaxies and drives the formation of planetary systems. The challenge of inferring the origin of different presolar dust grains from meteoritic samples motivates forward modelling to understand the contributions of low- and high-mass stars to dust in our Solar System. In this work we follow the evolution of dust with tracer particles within a hydrodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-like isolated disc galaxy. We find that nearly half of the grains released from stars lose less than $10\%$ of their initial mass due to thermal sputtering in the interstellar medium (ISM), with an average degree of atomisation $\sim$$10\%$ higher for dust grains released by supernovae relative to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star grains. We show through supernova remnant model variations that supernova (SN) dust survival is primarily shaped by the supernova bubble environment in the first million years (Myr) after the explosion rather than by its evolution during $10^2-10^3$ Myr in the ISM. The AGB/SN ratio of dust grains incorporated into newly formed stars approaches $0.8$ after a few hundred Myr of galactic evolution. Our analysis also shows that star-forming particles with short ($&lt;$$10$ Myr) free-floating time-scales in the ISM are predominantly released from supernovae rather than AGB stars. This implies that the Solar System budget of short-lived radioactive isotopes such as $^{26}$Al, whose decay contributed to melting and differentiating planetesimals, should have been provided by massive stars with masses $M \gtrsim 8$ M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence of any other non-ideal effect in a magnetic evolution. It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (m_e/n e^2) \vec{j} \right)$ with $m_e$ the electron mass, $n$ the electron number density, and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although the magnetic field is modified from its ideal evolution form by the electron inertia, the effect on particle trajectories, even electron trajectories, is small unless the current lies in thin sheets, which make $\vec{j}$ extremely large. The field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is closely related to Voigt normalized magnetic field, which is defined by a Laplacian smoothing of $\vec{B}$. The difference between $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\vec{B}$ involves the relativistically invariant four-space Laplacian acting on $\vec{B}$ with a $c/\omega_{pe}$ smoothing distance; $\omega_{pe}$ is the plasma frequency.</description>

      <title>H-Alpha Anomalyzer: An Explainable Anomaly Detector for Solar H-Alpha Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream, producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling qualitative evaluation by domain experts.</description>

Abstract: How do planetary systems, in general, and our own Solar System (SS), in particular, form? In conjunction, Astronomy and Isotope Cosmochemistry provide us with powerful tools to answer this age-old question. In this contribution, we review recent advances in our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution, including infall and disk processes, as explored through astrophysical models and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of SS materials.
  Astronomically, filamentary structures and anisotropy are observed across the dynamic range of star formation and disk substructures are found to be ubiquitous, highlighting how star- and planet-forming environments are far more complex and dynamic than previously thought. Isotopically, two decades of investigation of nucleosynthetic anomalies in bulk meteorites and refractory inclusions have produced a rich dataset, revealing the existence of pervasive heterogeneity in the early SS, both at the large- (i.e., NC-CC dichotomy) and fine-scale (i.e., trends within the NC group). Using an updated data compilation, we review the systematics and emerging structures of these anomalies as a function of their nucleosynthetic origin. We present the two main families of models - inheritance vs. unmixing - that have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed isotope heterogeneities, and discuss their respective implications for cloud infall and thermal processing in the disk. We also discuss how the extension of nucleosynthetic anomaly analyses to other chondritic components (Ameboid Olivine Aggregates, chondrules, matrix) has started to yield insights into transport, processing and mixing of dust in the disk. Limitations, open questions and key avenues for future work are presented in closing.</description>

      <title>Systematic Bayesian Evaluation of Resonance Parameters in 19Ne for the 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne and 18F(p,alpha)15O Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the nuclear structure properties of 19Ne using a novel and rigorous Bayesian statistical framework. Precise characterization of 19Ne resonance parameters is critical for accurately determining reaction rates of the astrophysically significant 15O(alpha, gamma)19Ne and 18F(p, alpha)15O reactions, which govern breakout from the hot CNO cycle in X-ray bursts and influence gamma-ray emission in novae, respectively. By reconstructing likelihood functions from published experimental data, including asymmetric uncertainties and upper or lower limits, we derive posterior distributions for resonance energies, decay widths, and branching ratios. Our Bayesian approach systematically incorporates previously reported discrepancies among measurements, providing a statistically robust and consistent treatment of these uncertainties. The evaluated resonance parameters and associated uncertainties provide crucial input for stellar nucleosynthesis modeling, contributing to a refined understanding of explosive astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>MCI: Multi-Channel Imager on the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Optical-blue channel and the Optical-red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. The three channels can target the same field simultaneously. Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and $\sim$7.5 x 7.5 arcmin$^2$ field of view. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views, as well as rich filter sets, which complements the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for the high-precision photometry, the weak-signal detection, and the related sciences. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.</description>

      <title>Refining the deep sub-barrier 12C+12C excitation function with STELLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: We have investigated the cross section around the lowest direct coincident gamma-particle measurements, where previously only limits could be established with the aim of obtaining a detailed description of the excitation function. We have furthermore analysed the ratio of extreme decay branching into the first excited state of daughter nuclei with alpha or proton emission at relative kinetic energies where previous measurements are in disagreement with each other. Conclusions: Our findings in the astrophysics RoI support reaction-rate models with a lower average S-factor trend, that deviates significantly from standard extrapolations between 2.2 MeV and 2.6 MeV, for stellar carbon burning simulations of up to 25 Msol stars. Based on our data, an overall increase of the S-factor at deep subbarrier energy cannot be confirmed. The extremely low ratio of the branching into the first excited state with proton over alpha emission of ~ 2% at 3.23 MeV might indicate the presence of alpha cluster compound states in 24Mg. This highly favours {\alpha} emission with fundamental consequences in possible stellar carbon burning sites.</description>

      <title>The evolution of complex organic molecules during star formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to be the precursors of pre-biotic molecules and are observed in many protostellar sources. For this paper we studied the formation of COMs during star formation and their evolution in the midplane of the circumstellar disk up to the end of the Class I stage. We used the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code to perform analytical simulations of star formation and the Nautilus code to model the chemical evolution. Most COMs mainly form during the collapse or in the disk, except the lightest (CH3CCH, C3H6, CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CN, CH3NC, C2H3CN, and CH3SH), which are significantly inherited by the disk from the prestellar phase. Over the first 150 kyr of the disk, the abundances of several COMs in the midplane vary negligibly (e.g., CH3CCH, CH3OH, and CH3CN), while others experience a variation of one order of magnitude (e.g., C2H3CHO HOCH2CHO, and CH3COCH2OH). Changing physical conditions also have an impact on the abundance profiles of COMs in the disk, and their inheritance. For example, increasing the temperature of the molecular cloud from 10 K to 15 K significantly promotes the formation of COMs in the prestellar phase, notably c-C2H4O and N-bearing species. Conversely, increasing the cloud mass from 2 Msol to 5 Msol only has a minor effect on the disk abundances in the early stages.</description>

      <title>Variability of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae with the Zwicky Transient Facility. II. Long-Timescale Variables including Wide Binary and Late Thermal Pulse Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second paper on our variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we report 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a $980$ day periodic variability with strange characteristics: `triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. The most plausible explanation is a wide binary with the photometric period being the orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of $700$ days and $230$ days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at $1.18$ hours. We then present CTSS 2 and K 3-5, which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPNe known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. We propose these to be late-thermal-pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1, showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. Similar to this object, LoTr 1 also has a fast-rotating wide subgiant companion. We suggest that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.</description>

      <title>A magnetic field detection in the massive O-type bright giant 63 Oph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface magnetic fields are detected in less than $10\%$ of the massive O-type star population and even less frequently among `old' massive stars approaching the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). It is unclear to what extent the rarity of magnetic detections in massive stars near the TAMS is due to magnetic field decay or observational biases. We report the detection of a weak surface magnetic field in the O-type giant 63~Oph ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}=35.0\pm0.3\,$kK, $\log g=3.51\pm0.03$) from new ESPaDOnS circularly polarized spectra. The mean longitudinal field strength associated with the magnetic detection is $\langle B_{z}\rangle=84\pm14\,$G, which we use to set a lower limit on the dipolar field strength of $B_{\mathrm{p}}\geq300\pm50\,$G. We report Balmer line equivalent widths (EW) and radial velocity (RV) measurements from the analysis of spectra primarily obtained by the IACOB project with the FEROS, FIES and HERMES spectrographs. We identify a dominant period of $\sim19.8\,$d in the EWs which we attribute to the effects of a rotating magnetosphere under the Oblique Rotator Model. We do not identify any coherent signals in a time-series analysis of archival Hipparcos, ASAS-SN and K2 photometry. Our findings show that 63~Oph may be a rare link between strongly magnetic massive stars detected on or near the zero-age main sequence and weakly-magnetic O-type supergiants. Additional observations are needed to fully constrain 63~Oph's magnetic field geometry and magnetospheric properties.</description>

      <title>Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.</description>

Abstract: We present lithium abundances for 119 main-sequence stars in the old open cluster NGC 188 (age = 6.3 Gyr), using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra from WIYN/Hydra. We observe the stars over multiple nights and measure radial velocities for each night, which we combine with Gaia proper motions to identify multiplicity and cluster membership. We identify 95 single members, 14 binary members, 9 members with uncertain multiplicity, and 1 single likely member. We determine effective temperatures using empirical color-temperature relations, surface gravities from isochrones, and microturbulence from empirical relations for main-sequence stars. Our sample includes G and K dwarfs with temperatures between 6000 and 5300 K, which expands significantly on earlier observations. We find that lithium abundances in NGC 188 are lower than predictions from standard stellar evolution theory. As expected, stars in NGC 188 are more lithium-depleted than those in the younger Hyades and Praesepe clusters (650 Myr). However, their abundances are higher, or at least comparable, to those in the slightly younger cluster M67 (4.5 Gyr), challenging the idea that older stars have lower lithium than younger ones. Lithium depletion may depend on factors beyond age and mass, such as metallicity.</description>
