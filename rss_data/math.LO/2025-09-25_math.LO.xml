      <title>Properties of Selector Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A serial property is a suitably enumerated sequence $\{F_n\}$ of formulas and is called selector provable in PA if there is a PA-recursive function $s(x)$ such that PA $\vdash \forall x (s(x){:}_{\text{PA}} \ulcorner F_x\urcorner)$ where $x{:}_{\text{PA}} y$ is a suitable proof predicate. These notions were introduced by Artemov in his analysis of consistency and the formalisation of metamathematics. These matters aside, the notion is intimately connected with that of relative consistency.
  This paper will give an overview of the mathematical properties of selector proofs. Topics include: the relationship between selector proofs, ordinary provability and the omega rule, the relationship between selector proofs and relative consistency, iterated selector proofs, and the complexity of selectors.</description>

      <title>Property B: A Baumgartner-style Property that Applies to Preservation of $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_2$ under Iterations with Supports of Size $\aleph_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a theorem on iterated forcing that can be used for preservation of $\aleph_2$ and $\aleph_1$ in iterations with supports of size $\aleph_1$ of forcings that have amalgamation properties similar to those present in the perfect set forcing. The work is modelled after Baumgartner's Axiom A and his proof that iterations with countable support of the same preserve $\aleph_1$. In honour of James E. Baumgartner, the property introduced here is called Property B$(\kappa)$. The known additional difficulties when forcing at cardinals higher than $\aleph_1$ make for a less general theorem and a more complex theorem on the iteration, which is not an iteration theorem in the classical sense.
  The results extend to other cardinals $\kappa$ such that $\kappa^{&lt;\kappa}=\kappa$, in place of $\aleph_1$. We give examples of individual forcings that have Property B$(\kappa)$ and their products. In particular, we introduce a correct version of the generalised Prikry forcing, which we call Perfect Set Forcing with Respect to a Filter and give its basic properties.</description>

      <title>Effective bases and notions of effective second countability in computable analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate different notions of "computable topological base" for represented spaces. We show that several non-equivalent notions of bases become equivalent when we consider computably enumerable bases. This indicates the existence of a robust notion of computably second countable represented space. These spaces are precisely those introduced by Grubba and Weihrauch under the name "computable topological spaces". The present work thus clarifies the articulation between Schr\"oder's approach to computable topology based on the Sierpinski representation and other approaches based on notions of computable bases. These other approaches turn out to be compatible with the Sierpinski representation approach, but also strictly less general. We revisit Schr\"oder's Effective Metrization Theorem, by showing that it characterizes those represented spaces that embed into computable metric spaces: those are the computably second countable strongly computably regular represented spaces. Finally, we study different forms of open choice problems. We show that having a computable open choice is equivalent to being computably separable, but that the "non-total open choice problem", i.e., open choice restricted to open sets that have non-empty complement, interacts with effective second countability in a satisfying way.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy problem in T-RAAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an implementable algorithm which solves the conjugacy problem in twisted right-angled Artin groups (T-RAAGs). In certain cases, the complexity is known to be linear, by reducing the problem to the twisted conjugacy problem in right-angled Artin groups. We also show that T-RAAGs are biautomatic, providing an alternative solution to the conjugacy problem.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of Boolean powers with ample generics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a finite non-abelian simple Mal'cev algebra, such as for example a finite simple non-abelian group or a finite simple non-zero ring. We show that the automorphism group of a filtered Boolean power of $A$ by the countable atomless Boolean algebra $A$ has ample generics. This uses the decomposition of that automorphism group as a semidirect product of a certain closure of a Boolean power of the automorphism group of $A$ by $B$ and the stabiliser of finitely many points in the homeomorphism group Homeo$2^\omega$ of the Cantor space $2^\omega$ by the authors. As an intermediate step, we show that pointwise stabilisers in Homeo$2^\omega$ have ample generics, which extends the result of Kwiatkowska that Homeo$2^\omega$ has ample generics.</description>

      <title>Degree of Kripke-incompleteness of Tense Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree of Kripke-incompleteness of a logic $L$ in some lattice $\mathcal{L}$ of logics is the cardinality of logics in $\mathcal{L}$ which share the same class of Kripke-frames with $L$. A celebrated result on Kripke-incompleteness is Blok's dichotomy theorem for the degree of Kripke-incompleteness in $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$: every modal logic $L\in\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$ is of the degree of Kripke-incompleteness $1$ or $2^{\aleph_0}$. In this work, we show that the dichotomy theorem for $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$ can be generalized to the lattices $\K$, $\LT$ and $\NExt(\ST)$ of tense logics. We also prove that in $\K$, $\LT$ and $\NExt(\ST)$, iterated splittings are exactly the strictly Kripke-complete logics.</description>

      <title>Logics with the axiom of convergence: complexity with a small number of variables in the language (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that many modal and superintuitionistic logics are PSPACE-hard in languages with a small number of variables; however, questions about the complexity of similar fragments of many logics obtained by adding various axioms to "standard" ones remain unexplored. We investigate the complexity of fragments of modal logics obtained by adding an axiom requiring the convergence of the accessibility relation in Kripke frames: S4.2, K4.2, Grz.2, and GL.2. The main result is that S4.2 and Grz.2 are PSPACE-complete in a language with two variables, while K4.2 and GL.2* (a logic near to GL.2) are PSPACE-complete in a language with one variable. The obtained results are extended to infinite classes of logics.</description>
