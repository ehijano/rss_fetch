      <title>Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Joint On-Off Selection and Beamforming with Discrete Phase Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) paradigm, extending the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to incorporate position reconfigurability of the elements. In our model, a `fluid' element is realized by a dense matrix of subelements over a given space and dynamically selecting specific elements for signal modulation based on channel conditions. Specifically, we consider a FRIS-assisted single-user single-input single-output (SU-SISO) system and formulate an optimization problem that can jointly optimize element selection and their discrete phase shifts to maximize the achievable rate. To address this problem efficiently, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) framework. Simulation results reveal that FRIS achieves significant performance gains over traditional RIS.</description>

      <title>Dual-Source SPIR over a noiseless MAC without Data Replication or Shared Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-theoretically secure Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) is known to be infeasible over noiseless channels with a single server. Known solutions to overcome this infeasibility involve additional resources such as database replication, shared randomness, or noisy channels. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for achieving SPIR with information-theoretic security guarantees, without relying on shared randomness, noisy channels, or data replication. Specifically, we demonstrate that it is sufficient to use a noiseless binary adder multiple-access channel, where inputs are controlled by two non-colluding servers and the output is observed by the client, alongside a public noiseless communication channel between the client and the servers. Furthermore, in this setting, we characterize the optimal file rates, i.e., the file lengths normalized by the number of channel uses, that can be transferred.</description>

      <title>Integrating Sensing and Communications in 6G? Not Until It Is Secure to Do So</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a cornerstone technology for forthcoming 6G systems, significantly improving spectrum and energy efficiency. However, the commercial viability of ISAC hinges on addressing critical challenges surrounding security, privacy, and trustworthiness. These challenges necessitate an end-to-end framework to safeguards both communication data and sensing information, particularly in ultra-low-latency and highly connected environments. Conventional solutions, such as encryption and key management, often fall short when confronted with ISAC's dual-functional nature. In this context, the physical layer plays a pivotal role: this article reviews emerging physical-layer strategies, including artificial noise (AN) injection, cooperative jamming, and constructive interference (CI), which enhance security by mitigating eavesdropping risks and safeguarding both communication data and sensing information. We further highlight the unique privacy issues that ISAC introduces to cellular networks and outline future research directions aimed at ensuring robust security and privacy for efficient ISAC deployment in 6G.</description>

      <title>The broken sample problem revisited: Proof of a conjecture by Bai-Hsing and high-dimensional extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical broken sample problem: Two samples of i.i.d. data points $\mathbf{X}=\{X_1,\cdots, X_n\}$ and $\mathbf{Y}=\{Y_1,\cdots,Y_m\}$ are observed without correspondence with $m\leq n$. Under the null hypothesis, $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are independent. Under the alternative hypothesis, $\mathbf{Y}$ is correlated with a random subsample of $\mathbf{X}$, in the sense that $(X_{\pi(i)},Y_i)$'s are drawn independently from some bivariate distribution for some latent injection $\pi:[m] \to [n]$. Originally introduced by DeGroot, Feder, and Goel (1971) to model matching records in census data, this problem has recently gained renewed interest due to its applications in data de-anonymization, data integration, and target tracking. Despite extensive research over the past decades, determining the precise detection threshold has remained an open problem even for equal sample sizes ($m=n$). Assuming $m$ and $n$ grow proportionally, we show that the sharp threshold is given by a spectral and an $L_2$ condition of the likelihood ratio operator, resolving a conjecture of Bai and Hsing (2005) in the positive. These results are extended to high dimensions and settle the sharp detection thresholds for Gaussian and Bernoulli models.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of omnidirectional path loss model based on directional model and multi-elliptical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology offers high throughput but has a limited radio range, necessitating the use of directional antennas or beamforming systems such as massive MIMO. Path loss (PL) models using narrow-beam antennas are known as directional models, while those using omnidirectional antennas are referred to as omnidirectional models. To standardize the analysis, omnidirectional PL models for mmWave ranges have been introduced, including TR 38.901 by 3GPP, which is based on measurements from directional antennas. However, synthesizing these measurements can be complex and time-consuming. This study proposes a numerical approach to derive an omnidirectional model from directional data using multi-elliptical geometry. We assessed the effectiveness of this method against existing PL models for mmWaves that are available in the literature.</description>

      <title>A low-PAPR Pilot Design and Optimization for OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed recently as a new waveform in the context of doubly-selective multi-path channels. This article proposes a novel pilot design that improves OTFS spectral efficiency (SE) while reducing its peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Instead of adopting an embedded data-orthogonal pilot for channel estimation, our scheme relies on Chu sequences superimposed to data symbols. We optimize the construction by investigating the best energy split between pilot and data symbols. Two equalizers, and an iterative channel estimation and equalization procedure are considered. We present extensive numerical results of relevant performance metrics, including the normalized mean squared error of the estimator, bit error rate, PAPR and SE. Our results show that, while the embedded pilot scheme estimates the channel more accurately, our approach yields a better tradeoff by achieving much higher spectral efficiency and lower PAPR.</description>

      <title>Cellular Automata on Probability Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework widely used to model complex systems driven by local interactions. Their simplicity lies in the use of a finite set of states and a uniform local rule, yet this simplicity leads to rich and diverse dynamical behaviors. CCAs have found applications in numerous scientific fields, including quantum computing, biology, social sciences, and cryptography. However, traditional CCAs assume complete certainty in the state of all cells, which limits their ability to model systems with inherent uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel generalization of CCAs, termed Cellular Automata on Measures (CAMs), which extends the classical framework to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. In this setting, the state of each cell is described by a probability measure, and the local rule operates on configurations of such measures. This generalization encompasses the traditional Bernoulli measure framework of CCAs and enables the study of more complex systems, including those with spatially varying probabilities. We provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for CAMs, demonstrate their applicability through concrete examples, and explore their potential to model the dynamics of random graphs. Additionally, we establish connections between CAMs and symbolic dynamics, presenting new avenues for research in random graph theory. This study lays the groundwork for future exploration of CAMs, offering a flexible and robust framework for modeling uncertainty in cellular automata and opening new directions for both theoretical analysis and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Sequence Sets With Low/Zero Ambiguity Zone Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequences with low/zero ambiguity zone (LAZ/ZAZ) properties are useful in modern communication and radar systems operating over mobile environments. This paper first presents a new family of ZAZ sequence sets motivated by the ``modulating'' zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences which were first proposed by Popovic and Mauritz. We then introduce a second family of ZAZ sequence sets with comb-like spectrum, whereby the local Doppler resilience is guaranteed by their inherent spectral nulls in the frequency domain. Finally, LAZ sequence sets are obtained by exploiting their connection with a novel class of mapping functions. These proposed unimodular ZAZ and LAZ sequence sets are cyclically distinct and asymptotically optimal with respect to the existing theoretical bounds on ambiguity functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in zero-error function computation with side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice and Bob have correlated sources $X,Y$ with joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot, \cdot)$. Bob wants to calculate $f(X,Y)$ with zero error. Alice encodes $m$-length blocks $(m \geq 1)$ of her observations to Bob over error-free channels, which can be classical or quantum. We consider two classical settings. (i) Alice communicates via a fixed length code (FLC), and (ii) Alice communicates via a variable length code (VLC). In the FLC scenario, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined $m$-instance ``confusion graph'' $G^{(m)}$. In the VLC scenario, the corresponding rate is characterized by the asymptotics of the chromatic entropy of $G^{(m)}$. %and has single-letter characterization in terms of K\"orner's graph entropy if $G^{(m)}$ is $m$-times graph OR product. In the quantum setting, we only consider fixed length codes; the corresponding rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of $G^{(m)}$. The behavior of the communication rates depends critically on $G^{(m)}$, which is shown to be sandwiched between $G^{\boxtimes m}$ ($m$-times strong product) and $G^{\lor m}$ ($m$-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function $f(\cdot, \cdot)$ and joint p.m.f. $p_{XY}(\cdot,\cdot)$ such that $G^{(m)}$ equals either $G^{\boxtimes m}$ or $G^{\lor m}$. Our work explores the multitude of possible behaviors of the quantum and classical (FLC/VLC) rates in the single-instance case and the asymptotic (in $m$) case for several classes of confusion graphs.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic limits and approximate message-passing for high-dimensional time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional time series appear in many scientific setups, demanding a nuanced approach to model and analyze the underlying dependence structure. Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</description>

Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a $3-$user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.</description>

      <title>Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC Waveform Design Based on Frequency-Domain Phase Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</description>

      <title>Blind Training for Channel-Adaptive Digital Semantic Communications</title>

Abstract: Semantic encoders and decoders for digital semantic communication (SC) often struggle to adapt to variations in unpredictable channel environments and diverse system designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for training semantic encoders and decoders to enable channel-adaptive digital SC. The core idea is to use binary symmetric channel (BSC) as a universal representation of generic digital communications, eliminating the need to specify channel environments or system designs. Based on this idea, our framework employs parallel BSCs to equivalently model the relationship between the encoder's output and the decoder's input. The bit-flip probabilities of these BSCs are treated as trainable parameters during end-to-end training, with varying levels of regularization applied to address diverse requirements in practical systems. The advantage of our framework is justified by developing a training-aware communication strategy for the inference stage. This strategy makes communication bit errors align with the pre-trained bit-flip probabilities by adaptively selecting power and modulation levels based on practical requirements and channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing training approaches in terms of both task performance and power consumption.</description>

Abstract: In spoken language, speakers transmit information not only using words, but also via a rich array of non-verbal signals, which include prosody -- the auditory features of speech. However, previous studies have shown that prosodic features exhibit significant redundancy with both past and future words. Here, we examine the time scale of this relationship: How many words in the past (or future) contribute to predicting prosody? We find that this scale differs for past and future words. Prosody's redundancy with past words extends across approximately 3-8 words, whereas redundancy with future words is limited to just 1-2 words. These findings indicate that the prosody-future relationship reflects local word dependencies or short-scale processes such as next word prediction, while the prosody-past relationship unfolds over a longer time scale. The latter suggests that prosody serves to emphasize earlier information that may be challenging for listeners to process given limited cognitive resources in real-time communication. Our results highlight the role of prosody in shaping efficient communication.</description>
