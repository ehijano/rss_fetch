      <title>SACA: A Scenario-Aware Collision Avoidance Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Integrating LLMs-Driven Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable collision avoidance under extreme situations remains a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, their application in safety-critical evasive maneuvers is limited by latency and robustness issues. Even so, LLMs stand out for their ability to weigh emotional, legal, and ethical factors, enabling socially responsible and context-aware collision avoidance. This paper proposes a scenario-aware collision avoidance (SACA) framework for extreme situations by integrating predictive scenario evaluation, data-driven reasoning, and scenario-preview-based deployment to improve collision avoidance decision-making. SACA consists of three key components. First, a predictive scenario analysis module utilizes obstacle reachability analysis and motion intention prediction to construct a comprehensive situational prompt. Second, an online reasoning module refines decision-making by leveraging prior collision avoidance knowledge and fine-tuning with scenario data. Third, an offline evaluation module assesses performance and stores scenarios in a memory bank. Additionally, A precomputed policy method improves deployability by previewing scenarios and retrieving or reasoning policies based on similarity and confidence levels. Real-vehicle tests show that, compared with baseline methods, SACA effectively reduces collision losses in extreme high-risk scenarios and lowers false triggering under complex conditions.

      <title>Enhancing Physical Human-Robot Interaction: Recognizing Digits via Intrinsic Robot Tactile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) remains a key challenge for achieving intuitive and safe interaction with robots. Current advancements often rely on external tactile sensors as interface, which increase the complexity of robotic systems. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic tactile sensing capabilities of collaborative robots to recognize digits drawn by humans on an uninstrumented touchpad mounted to the robot's flange. We propose a dataset of robot joint torque signals along with corresponding end-effector (EEF) forces and moments, captured from the robot's integrated torque sensors in each joint, as users draw handwritten digits (0-9) on the touchpad. The pHRI-DIGI-TACT dataset was collected from different users to capture natural variations in handwriting. To enhance classification robustness, we developed a data augmentation technique to account for reversed and rotated digits inputs. A Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network, leveraging the spatiotemporal nature of the data, performs online digit classification with an overall accuracy of 94\% across various test scenarios, including those involving users who did not participate in training the system. This methodology is implemented on a real robot in a fruit delivery task, demonstrating its potential to assist individuals in everyday life. Dataset and video demonstrations are available at: https://TS-Robotics.github.io/pHRI-DIGI/.</description>

      <title>PneuDrive: An Embedded Pressure Control System and Modeling Toolkit for Large-Scale Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a modular pressure control system called PneuDrive that can be used for large-scale, pneumatically-actuated soft robots. The design is particularly suited for situations which require distributed pressure control and high flow rates. Up to four embedded pressure control modules can be daisy-chained together as peripherals on a robust RS-485 bus, enabling closed-loop control of up to 16 valves with pressures ranging from 0-100 psig (0-689 kPa) over distances of more than 10 meters. The system is configured as a C++ ROS node by default. However, independent of ROS, we provide a Python interface with a scripting API for added flexibility. We demonstrate our implementation of PneuDrive through various trajectory tracking experiments for a three-joint, continuum soft robot with 12 different pressure inputs. Finally, we present a modeling toolkit with implementations of three dynamic actuation models, all suitable for real-time simulation and control. We demonstrate the use of this toolkit in customizing each model with real-world data and evaluating the performance of each model. The results serve as a reference guide for choosing between several actuation models in a principled manner. A video summarizing our results can be found here: https://bit.ly/3QkrEqO.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-aware Diffusion Models for Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00236v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating dynamically admissible trajectories for control tasks using diffusion models, particularly in scenarios where the environment is complex and system dynamics are crucial for practical application. We propose a novel framework that integrates system dynamics directly into the diffusion model's denoising process through a sequential prediction and projection mechanism. This mechanism, aligned with the diffusion model's noising schedule, ensures generated trajectories are both consistent with expert demonstrations and adhere to underlying physical constraints. Notably, our approach can generate maximum likelihood trajectories and accurately recover trajectories generated by linear feedback controllers, even when explicit dynamics knowledge is unavailable. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on standard control tasks and a complex non-convex optimal control problem involving waypoint tracking and collision avoidance, demonstrating its potential for efficient trajectory generation in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Co-design Optimization of Moving Parts for Compliance and Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design requirements for moving parts in mechanical assemblies are typically specified in terms of interactions with other parts. Some are purely kinematic (e.g., pairwise collision avoidance) while others depend on physics and material properties (e.g., deformation under loads). Kinematic design methods and physics-based shape/topology optimization (SO/TO) deal separately with these requirements. They rarely talk to each other as the former uses set algebra and group theory while the latter requires discretizing and solving differential equations. Hence, optimizing a moving part based on physics typically relies on either neglecting or pruning kinematic constraints in advance, e.g., by restricting the design domain to a collision-free space using an unsweep operation. In this paper, we show that TO can be used to co-design two or more parts in relative motion to simultaneously satisfy physics-based criteria and collision avoidance. We restrict our attention to maximizing linear-elastic stiffness while penalizing collision measures aggregated in time. We couple the TO loops for two parts in relative motion so that the evolution of each part's shape is accounted for when penalizing collision for the other part. The collision measures are computed by a correlation functional that can be discretized by left- and right-multiplying the shape design variables by a pre-computed matrix that depends solely on the motion. This decoupling is key to making the computations scalable for TO iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with 2D and 3D examples.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Algorithm to Symbolically Derive Generalized n-Trailer Vehicle Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Articulated multi-axle vehicles are interesting from a control-theoretic perspective due to their peculiar kinematic offtracking characteristics, instability modes, and singularities. Holonomic and nonholonomic constraints affecting the kinematic behavior is investigated in order to develop control-oriented kinematic models representative of these peculiarities. Then, the structure of these constraints is exploited to develop an iterative algorithm to symbolically derive yaw-plane kinematic models of generalized $n$-trailer articulated vehicles with an arbitrary number of multi-axle vehicle units. A formal proof is provided for the maximum number of kinematic controls admissible to a large-scale generalized articulated vehicle system, which leads to a generalized Ackermann steering law for $n$-trailer systems. Moreover, kinematic data collected from a test vehicle is used to validate the kinematic models and, to understand the rearward yaw rate amplification behavior of the vehicle pulling multiple simulated trailers.</description>

      <title>Aligning Diffusion Model with Problem Constraints for Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as effective generative frameworks for trajectory optimization, capable of producing high-quality and diverse solutions. However, training these models in a purely data-driven manner without explicit incorporation of constraint information often leads to violations of critical constraints, such as goal-reaching, collision avoidance, and adherence to system dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that aligns diffusion models explicitly with problem-specific constraints, drawing insights from the Dynamic Data-driven Application Systems (DDDAS) framework. Our approach introduces a hybrid loss function that explicitly measures and penalizes constraint violations during training. Furthermore, by statistically analyzing how constraint violations evolve throughout the diffusion steps, we develop a re-weighting strategy that aligns predicted violations to ground truth statistics at each diffusion step. Evaluated on a tabletop manipulation and a two-car reach-avoid problem, our constraint-aligned diffusion model significantly reduces constraint violations compared to traditional diffusion models, while maintaining the quality of trajectory solutions. This approach is well-suited for integration into the DDDAS framework for efficient online trajectory adaptation as new environmental data becomes available.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation in Dynamic Environments Using Data-Driven Koopman Operators and Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for safe navigation in dynamic environments by integrating Koopman operator theory with conformal prediction. Our approach leverages data-driven Koopman approximation to learn nonlinear dynamics and employs conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty, providing statistical guarantees on approximation errors. This uncertainty is effectively incorporated into a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) formulation through constraint tightening, ensuring robust safety guarantees. We implement a layered control architecture with a reference generator providing waypoints for safe navigation. The effectiveness of our methods is validated in simulation.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions via Minkowski Operations for Safe Navigation among Polytopic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safely navigating around obstacles while respecting the dynamics, control, and geometry of the underlying system is a key challenge in robotics. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) generate safe control policies by considering system dynamics and geometry when calculating safe forward-invariant sets. Existing CBF-based methods often rely on conservative shape approximations, like spheres or ellipsoids, which have explicit and differentiable distance functions. In this paper, we propose an optimization-defined CBF that directly considers the exact Signed Distance Function (SDF) between a polytopic robot and polytopic obstacles. Inspired by the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, we formulate both (i) minimum distance and (ii) penetration depth between polytopic sets as convex optimization problems in the space of Minkowski difference operations (the MD-space). Convenient geometric properties of the MD-space enable the derivatives of implicit SDF between two polytopes to be computed via differentiable optimization. We demonstrate the proposed framework in three scenarios including pure translation, initialization inside an unsafe set, and multi-obstacle avoidance. These three scenarios highlight the generation of a non-conservative maneuver, a recovery after starting in collision, and the consideration of multiple obstacles via pairwise CBF constraint, respectively.</description>

      <title>Think Small, Act Big: Primitive Prompt Learning for Lifelong Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building a lifelong robot that can effectively leverage prior knowledge for continuous skill acquisition remains significantly challenging. Despite the success of experience replay and parameter-efficient methods in alleviating catastrophic forgetting problem, naively applying these methods causes a failure to leverage the shared primitives between skills. To tackle these issues, we propose Primitive Prompt Learning (PPL), to achieve lifelong robot manipulation via reusable and extensible primitives. Within our two stage learning scheme, we first learn a set of primitive prompts to represent shared primitives through multi-skills pre-training stage, where motion-aware prompts are learned to capture semantic and motion shared primitives across different skills. Secondly, when acquiring new skills in lifelong span, new prompts are appended and optimized with frozen pretrained prompts, boosting the learning via knowledge transfer from old skills to new ones. For evaluation, we construct a large-scale skill dataset and conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating PPL's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking Based on Acoustic Inertial Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR) and demonstrate that AIM can support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts. We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than that of commercial UWB-based systems in a complex 10m\times10m indoor scenario, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS situations. When distributed microphone arrays are deployed, the mean error can be reduced to less than 0.5m in a 20m range, and even support spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts.</description>

      <title>Egocentric Conformal Prediction for Safe and Efficient Navigation in Dynamic Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) has emerged as a powerful tool in robotics and control, thanks to its ability to calibrate complex, data-driven models with formal guarantees. However, in robot navigation tasks, existing CP-based methods often decouple prediction from control, evaluating models without considering whether prediction errors actually compromise safety. Consequently, ego-vehicles may become overly conservative or even immobilized when all potential trajectories appear infeasible. To address this issue, we propose a novel CP-based navigation framework that responds exclusively to safety-critical prediction errors. Our approach introduces egocentric score functions that quantify how much closer obstacles are to a candidate vehicle position than anticipated. These score functions are then integrated into a model predictive control scheme, wherein each candidate state is individually evaluated for safety. Combined with an adaptive CP mechanism, our framework dynamically adjusts to changes in obstacle motion without resorting to unnecessary conservatism. Theoretical analyses indicate that our method outperforms existing CP-based approaches in terms of cost-efficiency while maintaining the desired safety levels, as further validated through experiments on real-world datasets featuring densely populated pedestrian environments.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Approximate Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Motion Cueing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs) encode the movement of simulated vehicles into movement that can be reproduced with a motion simulator to provide a realistic driving experience within the capabilities of the machine. This paper introduces a novel learning-based MCA for serial robot-based motion simulators. Building on the differentiable predictive control framework, the proposed method merges the advantages of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) - notably nonlinear constraint handling and accurate kinematic modeling - with the computational efficiency of machine learning. By shifting the computational burden to offline training, the new algorithm enables real-time operation at high control rates, thus overcoming the key challenge associated with NMPC-based motion cueing. The proposed MCA incorporates a nonlinear joint-space plant model and a policy network trained to mimic NMPC behavior while accounting for joint acceleration, velocity, and position limits. Simulation experiments across multiple motion cueing scenarios showed that the proposed algorithm performed on par with a state-of-the-art NMPC-based alternative in terms of motion cueing quality as quantified by the RMSE and correlation coefficient with respect to reference signals. However, the proposed algorithm was on average 400 times faster than the NMPC baseline. In addition, the algorithm successfully generalized to unseen operating conditions, including motion cueing scenarios on a different vehicle and real-time physics-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Robust LiDAR-Camera Calibration with 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-camera systems have become increasingly popular in robotics recently. A critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations, whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness. Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>MRHaD: Mixed Reality-based Hand-Drawn Map Editing Interface for Mobile Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robot navigation systems are increasingly relied upon in dynamic and complex environments, yet they often struggle with map inaccuracies and the resulting inefficient path planning. This paper presents MRHaD, a Mixed Reality-based Hand-drawn Map Editing Interface that enables intuitive, real-time map modifications through natural hand gestures. By integrating the MR head-mounted display with the robotic navigation system, operators can directly create hand-drawn restricted zones (HRZ), thereby bridging the gap between 2D map representations and the real-world environment. Comparative experiments against conventional 2D editing methods demonstrate that MRHaD significantly improves editing efficiency, map accuracy, and overall usability, contributing to safer and more efficient mobile robot operations. The proposed approach provides a robust technical foundation for advancing human-robot collaboration and establishing innovative interaction models that enhance the hybrid future of robotics and human society.

      <title>Contextualized Autonomous Drone Navigation using LLMs Deployed in Edge-Cloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation is usually trained offline in diverse scenarios and fine-tuned online subject to real-world experiences. However, the real world is dynamic and changeable, and many environmental encounters/effects are not accounted for in real-time due to difficulties in describing them within offline training data or hard to describe even in online scenarios. However, we know that the human operator can describe these dynamic environmental encounters through natural language, adding semantic context. The research is to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform real-time contextual code adjustment to autonomous navigation. The challenge not evaluated in literature is what LLMs are appropriate and where should these computationally heavy algorithms sit in the computation-communication edge-cloud computing architectures. In this paper, we evaluate how different LLMs can adjust both the navigation map parameters dynamically (e.g., contour map shaping) and also derive navigation task instruction sets. We then evaluate which LLMs are most suitable and where they should sit in future edge-cloud of 6G telecommunication architectures.</description>

      <title>Learning Bipedal Locomotion on Gear-Driven Humanoid Robot Using Foot-Mounted IMUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid robots with high-gear ratio actuators remains challenging due to complex actuator dynamics and the absence of torque sensors. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework leveraging foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Instead of pursuing detailed actuator modeling and system identification, we utilize foot-mounted IMU measurements to enhance rapid stabilization capabilities over challenging terrains. Additionally, we propose symmetric data augmentation dedicated to the proposed observation space and random network distillation to enhance bipedal locomotion learning over rough terrain. We validate our approach through hardware experiments on a miniature-sized humanoid EVAL-03 over a variety of environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves rapid stabilization capabilities over non-rigid surfaces and sudden environmental transitions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Walkers with Parallel Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged robots with closed-loop kinematic chains are increasingly prevalent due to their increased mobility and efficiency. Yet, most motion generation methods rely on serial-chain approximations, sidestepping their specific constraints and dynamics. This leads to suboptimal motions and limits the adaptability of these methods to diverse kinematic structures. We propose a comprehensive motion generation method that explicitly incorporates closed-loop kinematics and their associated constraints in an optimal control problem, integrating kinematic closure conditions and their analytical derivatives. This allows the solver to leverage the non-linear transmission effects inherent to closed-chain mechanisms, reducing peak actuator efforts and expanding their effective operating range. Unlike previous methods, our framework does not require serial approximations, enabling more accurate and efficient motion strategies. We also are able to generate the motion of more complex robots for which an approximate serial chain does not exist. We validate our approach through simulations and experiments, demonstrating superior performance in complex tasks such as rapid locomotion and stair negotiation. This method enhances the capabilities of current closed-loop robots and broadens the design space for future kinematic architectures.</description>

      <title>Immersive Explainability: Visualizing Robot Navigation Decisions through XAI Semantic Scene Projections in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end robot policies achieve high performance through neural networks trained via reinforcement learning (RL). Yet, their black box nature and abstract reasoning pose challenges for human-robot interaction (HRI), because humans may experience difficulty in understanding and predicting the robot's navigation decisions, hindering trust development. We present a virtual reality (VR) interface that visualizes explainable AI (XAI) outputs and the robot's lidar perception to support intuitive interpretation of RL-based navigation behavior. By visually highlighting objects based on their attribution scores, the interface grounds abstract policy explanations in the scene context. This XAI visualization bridges the gap between obscure numerical XAI attribution scores and a human-centric semantic level of explanation. A within-subjects study with 24 participants evaluated the effectiveness of our interface for four visualization conditions combining XAI and lidar. Participants ranked scene objects across navigation scenarios based on their importance to the robot, followed by a questionnaire assessing subjective understanding and predictability. Results show that semantic projection of attributions significantly enhances non-expert users' objective understanding and subjective awareness of robot behavior. In addition, lidar visualization further improves perceived predictability, underscoring the value of integrating XAI and sensor for transparent, trustworthy HRI.</description>

      <title>Auditory Localization and Assessment of Consequential Robot Sounds: A Multi-Method Study in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans but are often out of sight, so that humans need to rely on the sounds of the robots to recognize their presence. For successful human-robot interaction (HRI), it is therefore crucial to understand how humans perceive robots by their consequential sounds, i.e., operating noise. Prior research suggests that the sound of a quadruped Go1 is more detectable than that of a wheeled Turtlebot. This study builds on this and examines the human ability to localize consequential sounds of three robots (quadruped Go1, wheeled Turtlebot 2i, wheeled HSR) in Virtual Reality. In a within-subjects design, we assessed participants' localization performance for the robots with and without an acoustic vehicle alerting system (AVAS) for two velocities (0.3, 0.8 m/s) and two trajectories (head-on, radial). In each trial, participants were presented with the sound of a moving robot for 3~s and were tasked to point at its final position (localization task). Localization errors were measured as the absolute angular difference between the participants' estimated and the actual robot position. Results showed that the robot type significantly influenced the localization accuracy and precision, with the sound of the wheeled HSR (especially without AVAS) performing worst under all experimental conditions. Surprisingly, participants rated the HSR sound as more positive, less annoying, and more trustworthy than the Turtlebot and Go1 sound. This reveals a tension between subjective evaluation and objective auditory localization performance. Our findings highlight consequential robot sounds as a critical factor for designing intuitive and effective HRI, with implications for human-centered robot design and social navigation.</description>

      <title>Energy Weighted Learning Progress Guided Interleaved Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can continuously acquire new skills and knowledge by exploiting existing ones for improved learning, without forgetting them. Similarly, 'continual learning' in machine learning aims to learn new information while preserving the previously acquired knowledge. Existing research often overlooks the nature of human learning, where tasks are interleaved due to human choice or environmental constraints. So, almost never do humans master one task before switching to the next. To investigate to what extent human-like learning can benefit the learner, we propose a method that interleaves tasks based on their 'learning progress' and energy consumption. From a machine learning perspective, our approach can be seen as a multi-task learning system that balances learning performance with energy constraints while mimicking ecologically realistic human task learning. To assess the validity of our approach, we consider a robot learning setting in simulation, where the robot learns the effect of its actions in different contexts. The conducted experiments show that our proposed method achieves better performance than sequential task learning and reduces energy consumption for learning the tasks.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of an Intention-Aware Probabilistic Framework for Trajectory Prediction: Integrating COLREGS, Grounding Hazards, and Planned Routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision avoidance capability is an essential component in an autonomous vessel navigation system. To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</description>

      <title>Predictive Spray Switching for an Efficient Path Planning Pattern for Area Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents within an arable farming context a predictive logic for the on- and off-switching of a set of nozzles attached to a boom aligned along a working width and carried by a machinery with the purpose of applying spray along the working width while the machinery is traveling along a specific path planning pattern. Concatenation of multiple of those path patterns and corresponding concatenation of proposed switching logics enables nominal lossless spray application for area coverage tasks. Proposed predictive switching logic is compared to the common and state-of-the-art reactive switching logic for Boustrophedon-based path planning for area coverage. The trade-off between reduction in pathlength and increase in the number of required on- and off-switchings for proposed method is discussed.</description>

      <title>Visual Environment-Interactive Planning for Embodied Complex-Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on Embodied Complex-Question Answering task, which means the embodied robot need to understand human questions with intricate structures and abstract semantics. The core of this task lies in making appropriate plans based on the perception of the visual environment. Existing methods often generate plans in a once-for-all manner, i.e., one-step planning. Such approach rely on large models, without sufficient understanding of the environment. Considering multi-step planning, the framework for formulating plans in a sequential manner is proposed in this paper. To ensure the ability of our framework to tackle complex questions, we create a structured semantic space, where hierarchical visual perception and chain expression of the question essence can achieve iterative interaction. This space makes sequential task planning possible. Within the framework, we first parse human natural language based on a visual hierarchical scene graph, which can clarify the intention of the question. Then, we incorporate external rules to make a plan for current step, weakening the reliance on large models. Every plan is generated based on feedback from visual perception, with multiple rounds of interaction until an answer is obtained. This approach enables continuous feedback and adjustment, allowing the robot to optimize its action strategy. To test our framework, we contribute a new dataset with more complex questions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs excellently and stably on complex tasks. And also, the feasibility of our approach in real-world scenarios has been established, indicating its practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Human Behavior Prediction Using Multimodal Large Language Models: Challenges and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting human behavior in shared environments is crucial for safe and efficient human-robot interaction. Traditional data-driven methods to that end are pre-trained on domain-specific datasets, activity types, and prediction horizons. In contrast, the recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise open-ended cross-domain generalization to describe various human activities and make predictions in any context. In particular, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are able to integrate information from various sources, achieving more contextual awareness and improved scene understanding. The difficulty in applying general-purpose MLLMs directly for prediction stems from their limited capacity for processing large input sequences, sensitivity to prompt design, and expensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of applying pre-trained MLLMs for context-aware human behavior prediction. To this end, we introduce a modular multimodal human activity prediction framework that allows us to benchmark various MLLMs, input variations, In-Context Learning (ICL), and autoregressive techniques. Our evaluation indicates that the best-performing framework configuration is able to reach 92.8% semantic similarity and 66.1% exact label accuracy in predicting human behaviors in the target frame.</description>

      <title>Combined Aerial Cooperative Tethered Carrying and Path Planning for Quadrotors in Confined Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a novel combined aerial cooperative tethered carrying and path planning framework is introduced with a special focus on applications in confined environments. The proposed work is aiming towards solving the path planning problem for the formation of two quadrotors, while having a rope hanging below them and passing through or around obstacles. A novel composition mechanism is proposed, which simplifies the degrees of freedom of the combined aerial system and expresses the corresponding states in a compact form. Given the state of the composition, a dynamic body is generated that encapsulates the quadrotors-rope system and makes the procedure of collision checking between the system and the environment more efficient. By utilizing the above two abstractions, an RRT path planning scheme is implemented and a collision-free path for the formation is generated. This path is decomposed back to the quadrotors' desired positions that are fed to the Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for each one. The efficiency of the proposed framework is experimentally evaluated.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal Convexified Reeds-Shepp Paths on a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses time-optimal path planning for a vehicle capable of moving both forward and backward on a unit sphere with a unit maximum speed, and constrained by a maximum absolute turning rate $U_{max}$. The proposed formulation can be utilized for optimal attitude control of underactuated satellites, optimal motion planning for spherical rolling robots, and optimal path planning for mobile robots on spherical surfaces or uneven terrains. By utilizing Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and analyzing phase portraits, it is shown that for $U_{max}\geq1$, the optimal path connecting a given initial configuration to a desired terminal configuration falls within a sufficient list of 23 path types, each comprising at most 6 segments. These segments belong to the set $\{C,G,T\}$, where $C$ represents a tight turn with radius $r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+U_{max}^2}}$, $G$ represents a great circular arc, and $T$ represents a turn-in-place motion. Closed-form expressions for the angles of each path in the sufficient list are derived. The source code for solving the time-optimal path problem and visualization is publicly available at https://github.com/sixuli97/Optimal-Spherical-Convexified-Reeds-Shepp-Paths.</description>

      <title>HDVIO2.0: Wind and Disturbance Estimation with Hybrid Dynamics VIO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is widely used for state estimation in autonomous micro aerial vehicles using onboard sensors. Current methods improve VIO by incorporating a model of the translational vehicle dynamics, yet their performance degrades when faced with low-accuracy vehicle models or continuous external disturbances, like wind. Additionally, incorporating rotational dynamics in these models is computationally intractable when they are deployed in online applications, e.g., in a closed-loop control system. We present HDVIO2.0, which models full 6-DoF, translational and rotational, vehicle dynamics and tightly incorporates them into a VIO with minimal impact on the runtime. HDVIO2.0 builds upon the previous work, HDVIO, and addresses these challenges through a hybrid dynamics model combining a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component, with access to control commands and IMU history, to capture complex aerodynamic effects. The key idea behind modeling the rotational dynamics is to represent them with continuous-time functions. HDVIO2.0 leverages the divergence between the actual motion and the predicted motion from the hybrid dynamics model to estimate external forces as well as the robot state. Our system surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in experiments using public and new drone dynamics datasets, as well as real-world flights in winds up to 25 km/h. Unlike existing approaches, we also show that accurate vehicle dynamics predictions are achievable without precise knowledge of the full vehicle state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors use structured light to measure deformation in their elastomeric interface. Until now, vision-based tactile sensors such as DIGIT and GelSight have been using a single, static pattern of structured light tuned to the specific form factor of the sensor. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of dynamic illumination patterns, in conjunction with image fusion techniques, to improve the quality of sensing of vision-based tactile sensors. Specifically, we propose to capture multiple measurements, each with a different illumination pattern, and then fuse them together to obtain a single, higher-quality measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that this type of dynamic illumination yields significant improvements in image contrast, sharpness, and background difference. This discovery opens the possibility of retroactively improving the sensing quality of existing vision-based tactile sensors with a simple software update, and for new hardware designs capable of fully exploiting dynamic illumination.</description>

      <title>Skeletonization Quality Evaluation: Geometric Metrics for Point Cloud Analysis in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skeletonization is a powerful tool for shape analysis, rooted in the inherent instinct to understand an object's morphology. It has found applications across various domains, including robotics. Although skeletonization algorithms have been studied in recent years, their performance is rarely quantified with detailed numerical evaluations. This work focuses on defining and quantifying geometric properties to systematically score the skeletonization results of point cloud shapes across multiple aspects, including topological similarity, boundedness, centeredness, and smoothness. We introduce these representative metric definitions along with a numerical scoring framework to analyze skeletonization outcomes concerning point cloud data for different scenarios, from object manipulation to mobile robot navigation. Additionally, we provide an open-source tool to enable the research community to evaluate and refine their skeleton models. Finally, we assess the performance and sensitivity of the proposed geometric evaluation methods from various robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and Improving Optimal Control Problems with Directional Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many robotics tasks, such as path planning or trajectory optimization, are formulated as optimal control problems (OCPs). The key to obtaining high performance lies in the design of the OCP's objective function. In practice, the objective function consists of a set of individual components that must be carefully modeled and traded off such that the OCP has the desired solution. It is often challenging to balance multiple components to achieve the desired solution and to understand, when the solution is undesired, the impact of individual cost components. In this paper, we present a framework addressing these challenges based on the concept of directional corrections. Specifically, given the solution to an OCP that is deemed undesirable, and access to an expert providing the direction of change that would increase the desirability of the solution, our method analyzes the individual cost components for their "consistency" with the provided directional correction. This information can be used to improve the OCP formulation, e.g., by increasing the weight of consistent cost components, or reducing the weight of - or even redesigning - inconsistent cost components. We also show that our framework can automatically tune parameters of the OCP to achieve consistency with a set of corrections.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Zero-Shot Speed Estimation of BLDC motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate speed estimation in sensorless brushless DC motors is essential for high-performance control and monitoring, yet conventional model-based approaches struggle with system nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties. In this work, we propose an in-context learning framework leveraging transformer-based models to perform zero-shot speed estimation using only electrical measurements. By training the filter offline on simulated motor trajectories, we enable real-time inference on unseen real motors without retraining, eliminating the need for explicit system identification while retaining adaptability to varying operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional Kalman filter-based estimators, especially in low-speed regimes that are crucial during motor startup.</description>

      <title>UnIRe: Unsupervised Instance Decomposition for Dynamic Urban Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing and decomposing dynamic urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, urban planning, and scene editing. However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Provably Stable Multi-Agent Routing with Bounded-Delay Adversaries in the Decision Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying multi-agent routing settings, where adversarial agents are part of the assignment and decision loop, degrading the performance of the fleet by incurring bounded delays while servicing pickup-and-delivery requests. Specifically, we are interested in characterizing conditions on the fleet size and the proportion of adversarial agents for which a routing policy remains stable, where stability for a routing policy is achieved if the number of outstanding requests is uniformly bounded over time. To obtain this characterization, we first establish a threshold on the proportion of adversarial agents above which previously stable routing policies for fully cooperative fleets are provably unstable. We then derive a sufficient condition on the fleet size to recover stability given a maximum proportion of adversarial agents. We empirically validate our theoretical results on a case study on autonomous taxi routing, where we consider transportation requests from real San Francisco taxicab data.</description>

      <title>A Graph-to-Text Approach to Knowledge-Grounded Response Generation in Human-Robot Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs are often used to represent structured information in a flexible and efficient manner, but their use in situated dialogue remains under-explored. This paper presents a novel conversational model for human--robot interaction that rests upon a graph-based representation of the dialogue state. The knowledge graph representing the dialogue state is continuously updated with new observations from the robot sensors, including linguistic, situated and multimodal inputs, and is further enriched by other modules, in particular for spatial understanding. The neural conversational model employed to respond to user utterances relies on a simple but effective graph-to-text mechanism that traverses the dialogue state graph and converts the traversals into a natural language form. This conversion of the state graph into text is performed using a set of parameterized functions, and the values for those parameters are optimized based on a small set of Wizard-of-Oz interactions. After this conversion, the text representation of the dialogue state graph is included as part of the prompt of a large language model used to decode the agent response. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated through a user study with a humanoid robot that acts as conversation partner to evaluate the impact of the graph-to-text mechanism on the response generation. After moving a robot along a tour of an indoor environment, participants interacted with the robot using spoken dialogue and evaluated how well the robot was able to answer questions about what the robot observed during the tour. User scores show a statistically significant improvement in the perceived factuality of the robot responses when the graph-to-text approach is employed, compared to a baseline using inputs structured as semantic triples.</description>

      <title>Temporal and Semantic Evaluation Metrics for Foundation Models in Post-Hoc Analysis of Robotic Sub-tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works in Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) show that training control policies on language-supervised robot trajectories with quality labeled data markedly improves agent task success rates. However, the scarcity of such data presents a significant hurdle to extending these methods to general use cases. To address this concern, we present an automated framework to decompose trajectory data into temporally bounded and natural language-based descriptive sub-tasks by leveraging recent prompting strategies for Foundation Models (FMs) including both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework provides both time-based and language-based descriptions for lower-level sub-tasks that comprise full trajectories. To rigorously evaluate the quality of our automatic labeling framework, we contribute an algorithm SIMILARITY to produce two novel metrics, temporal similarity and semantic similarity. The metrics measure the temporal alignment and semantic fidelity of language descriptions between two sub-task decompositions, namely an FM sub-task decomposition prediction and a ground-truth sub-task decomposition. We present scores for temporal similarity and semantic similarity above 90%, compared to 30% of a randomized baseline, for multiple robotic environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our results enable building diverse, large-scale, language-supervised datasets for improved robotic TAMP.</description>

      <title>DELTA: Decomposed Efficient Long-Term Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art.

      <title>Hierarchical Procedural Framework for Low-latency Robot-Assisted Hand-Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in robotics have been driving the development of human-robot interaction (HRI) technologies. However, accurately perceiving human actions and achieving adaptive control remains a challenge in facilitating seamless coordination between human and robotic movements. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical procedural framework to enable dynamic robot-assisted hand-object interaction. An open-loop hierarchy leverages the computer vision (CV)-based 3D reconstruction of the human hand, based on which motion primitives have been designed to translate hand motions into robotic actions. The low-level coordination hierarchy fine-tunes the robot's action by using the continuously updated 3D hand models. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical control architecture. The adaptive coordination between human and robot behavior has achieved a delay of $\leq 0.3$ seconds in the tele-interaction scenario. A case study of ring-wearing tasks indicates the potential application of this work in assistive technologies such as healthcare and manufacturing.</description>

      <title>AVOCADO: Adaptive Optimal Collision Avoidance driven by Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AVOCADO (AdaptiVe Optimal Collision Avoidance Driven by Opinion), a novel navigation approach to address holonomic robot collision avoidance when the robot does not know how cooperative the other agents in the environment are. AVOCADO departs from a Velocity Obstacle's (VO) formulation akin to the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance method. However, instead of assuming reciprocity, it poses an adaptive control problem to adapt to the cooperation level of other robots and agents in real time. This is achieved through a novel nonlinear opinion dynamics design that relies solely on sensor observations. As a by-product, we leverage tools from the opinion dynamics formulation to naturally avoid the deadlocks in geometrically symmetric scenarios that typically suffer VO-based planners. Extensive numerical simulations show that AVOCADO surpasses existing motion planners in mixed cooperative/non-cooperative navigation environments in terms of success rate, time to goal and computational time. In addition, we conduct multiple real experiments that verify that AVOCADO is able to avoid collisions in environments crowded with other robots and humans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results in robust legged locomotion. While there exists a wide variety of legged platforms such as quadruped, humanoids, and hexapods, the field is still missing a single learning framework that can control all these different embodiments easily and effectively and possibly transfer, zero or few-shot, to unseen robot embodiments. We introduce URMA, the Unified Robot Morphology Architecture, to close this gap. Our framework brings the end-to-end Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning approach to the realm of legged robots, enabling the learned policy to control any type of robot morphology. The key idea of our method is to allow the network to learn an abstract locomotion controller that can be seamlessly shared between embodiments thanks to our morphology-agnostic encoders and decoders. This flexible architecture can be seen as a potential first step in building a foundation model for legged robot locomotion. Our experiments show that URMA can learn a locomotion policy on multiple embodiments that can be easily transferred to unseen robot platforms in simulation and the real world.</description>

      <title>Whole-Body Dynamic Throwing with Legged Manipulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throwing with a legged robot involves precise coordination of object manipulation and locomotion - crucial for advanced real-world interactions. Most research focuses on either manipulation or locomotion, with minimal exploration of tasks requiring both. This work investigates leveraging all available motors (full-body) over arm-only throwing in legged manipulators. We frame the task as a deep reinforcement learning (RL) objective, optimising throwing accuracy towards any user-commanded target destination and the robot's stability. Evaluations on a humanoid and an armed quadruped in simulation show that full-body throwing improves range, accuracy, and stability by exploiting body momentum, counter-balancing, and full-body dynamics. We introduce an optimised adaptive curriculum to balance throwing accuracy and stability, along with a tailored RL environment setup for efficient learning in sparse-reward conditions. Unlike prior work, our approach generalises to targets in 3D space. We transfer our learned controllers from simulation to a real humanoid platform.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin for Telesurgery under Intermittent Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Telesurgery is an effective way to deliver service from expert surgeons to areas without immediate access to specialized resources. However, many of these areas, such as rural districts or battlefields, might be subject to different problems in communication, especially latency and intermittent periods of communication outage. This challenge motivates the use of a digital twin for the surgical system, where a simulation would mirror the robot hardware and surgical environment in the real world. The surgeon would then be able to interact with the digital twin during communication outage, followed by a recovery strategy on the real robot upon reestablishing communication. This paper builds the digital twin for the da Vinci surgical robot, with a buffering and replay strategy that reduces the mean task completion time by 23% when compared to the baseline, for a peg transfer task subject to intermittent communication outage. The relevant code can be found here: https://github.com/LCSR-CIIS/dvrk_digital_twin_teleoperation.</description>

      <title>Tra-MoE: Learning Trajectory Prediction Model from Multiple Domains for Adaptive Policy Conditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from multiple domains is a primary factor that influences the generalization of a single unified robot system. In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</description>

Abstract: Teleoperation provides an effective way to collect robot data, which is crucial for learning from demonstrations. In this field, teleoperation faces several key challenges: user-friendliness for new users, safety assurance, and transferability across different platforms. While collecting real robot dexterous manipulation data by teleoperation to train robots has shown impressive results on diverse tasks, due to the morphological differences between human and robot hands, it is not only hard for new users to understand the action mapping but also raises potential safety concerns during operation. To address these limitations, we introduce TelePreview. This teleoperation system offers real-time visual feedback on robot actions based on human user inputs, with a total hardware cost of less than $1,000. TelePreview allows the user to see a virtual robot that represents the outcome of the user's next movement. By enabling flexible switching between command visualization and actual execution, this system helps new users learn how to demonstrate quickly and safely. We demonstrate that it outperforms other teleoperation systems across five tasks, emphasize its ease of use, and highlight its straightforward deployment across diverse robotic platforms. We release our code and a deployment document on our website https://nus-lins-lab.github.io/telepreview-web/.</description>

      <title>RG-Attn: Radian Glue Attention for Multi-modality Multi-agent Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative perception offers an optimal solution to overcome the perception limitations of single-agent systems by leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for data sharing and fusion across multiple agents. However, most existing approaches focus on single-modality data exchange, limiting the potential of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fusion across agents. This overlooks the opportunity to utilize multi-modality data per agent, restricting the system's performance. In the automotive industry, manufacturers adopt diverse sensor configurations, resulting in heterogeneous combinations of sensor modalities across agents. To harness the potential of every possible data source for optimal performance, we design a robust LiDAR and camera cross-modality fusion module, Radian-Glue-Attention (RG-Attn), applicable to both intra-agent cross-modality fusion and inter-agent cross-modality fusion scenarios, owing to the convenient coordinate conversion by transformation matrix and the unified sampling/inversion mechanism. We also propose two different architectures, named Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP) and Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), for conducting cooperative perception. PTP aims for maximum precision performance and achieves smaller data packet size by limiting cross-agent fusion to a single instance, but requiring all participants to be equipped with LiDAR. In contrast, CoS-CoCo supports agents with any configuration-LiDAR-only, camera-only, or LiDAR-camera-both, presenting more generalization ability. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both real and simulated cooperative perception datasets. The code is now available at GitHub.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Generating Expressive Quadruped Behaviors via Language-Guided Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expressive robotic behavior is essential for the widespread acceptance of robots in social environments. Recent advancements in learned legged locomotion controllers have enabled more dynamic and versatile robot behaviors. However, determining the optimal behavior for interactions with different users across varied scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods either rely on natural language input, which is efficient but low-resolution, or learn from human preferences, which, although high-resolution, is sample inefficient. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages priors generated by pre-trained LLMs alongside the precision of preference learning. Our method, termed Language-Guided Preference Learning (LGPL), uses LLMs to generate initial behavior samples, which are then refined through preference-based feedback to learn behaviors that closely align with human expectations. Our core insight is that LLMs can guide the sampling process for preference learning, leading to a substantial improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate that LGPL can quickly learn accurate and expressive behaviors with as few as four queries, outperforming both purely language-parameterized models and traditional preference learning approaches.

      <title>A formal implementation of Behavior Trees to act in robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior Trees (BT) are becoming quite popular as an Acting component of autonomous robotic systems. We propose to define a formal semantics to BT by translating them to a formal language which enables us to perform verification of programs written with BT, as well as runtime verification while these BT execute. This allows us to formally verify BT correctness without requiring BT programmers to master formal languages and without compromising BT most valuable features: modularity, flexibility and reusability. We present the formal framework we use: Fiacre, its language and the produced TTS model; Tina, its model checking tools and Hippo, its runtime verification engine. We then show how the translation from BT to Fiacre is automatically done, the type of formal LTL and CTL properties we can check offline and how to execute the formal model online in place of a regular BT engine. We illustrate our approach on two robotics applications, and show how BT can be extended with state variables, eval nodes, node evaluation results and benefit of other features available in the Fiacre formal framework (e.g., time).</description>

      <title>Scalable Real2Sim: Physics-Aware Asset Generation Via Robotic Pick-and-Place Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating object dynamics from real-world perception shows great promise for digital twins and robotic manipulation but often demands labor-intensive measurements and expertise. We present a fully automated Real2Sim pipeline that generates simulation-ready assets for real-world objects through robotic interaction. Using only a robot's joint torque sensors and an external camera, the pipeline identifies visual geometry, collision geometry, and physical properties such as inertial parameters. Our approach introduces a general method for extracting high-quality, object-centric meshes from photometric reconstruction techniques (e.g., NeRF, Gaussian Splatting) by employing alpha-transparent training while explicitly distinguishing foreground occlusions from background subtraction. We validate the full pipeline through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse objects. By eliminating the need for manual intervention or environment modifications, our pipeline can be integrated directly into existing pick-and-place setups, enabling scalable and efficient dataset creation.

      <title>Reactive Diffusion Policy: Slow-Fast Visual-Tactile Policy Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can accomplish complex contact-rich tasks using vision and touch, with highly reactive capabilities such as quick adjustments to environmental changes and adaptive control of contact forces; however, this remains challenging for robots. Existing visual imitation learning (IL) approaches rely on action chunking to model complex behaviors, which lacks the ability to respond instantly to real-time tactile feedback during the chunk execution. Furthermore, most teleoperation systems struggle to provide fine-grained tactile / force feedback, which limits the range of tasks that can be performed. To address these challenges, we introduce TactAR, a low-cost teleoperation system that provides real-time tactile feedback through Augmented Reality (AR), along with Reactive Diffusion Policy (RDP), a novel slow-fast visual-tactile imitation learning algorithm for learning contact-rich manipulation skills. RDP employs a two-level hierarchy: (1) a slow latent diffusion policy for predicting high-level action chunks in latent space at low frequency, (2) a fast asymmetric tokenizer for closed-loop tactile feedback control at high frequency. This design enables both complex trajectory modeling and quick reactive behavior within a unified framework. Through extensive evaluation across three challenging contact-rich tasks, RDP significantly improves performance compared to state-of-the-art visual IL baselines through rapid response to tactile / force feedback. Furthermore, experiments show that RDP is applicable across different tactile / force sensors. Code and videos are available on https://reactive-diffusion-policy.github.io.</description>

      <title>VET: A Visual-Electronic Tactile System for Immersive Human-Machine Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of deeper immersion in human-machine interaction, achieving higher-dimensional tactile input and output on a single interface has become a key research focus. This study introduces the Visual-Electronic Tactile (VET) System, which builds upon vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) and integrates electrical stimulation feedback to enable bidirectional tactile communication. We propose and implement a system framework that seamlessly integrates an electrical stimulation film with VBTS using a screen-printing preparation process, eliminating interference from traditional methods. While VBTS captures multi-dimensional input through visuotactile signals, electrical stimulation feedback directly stimulates neural pathways, preventing interference with visuotactile information. The potential of the VET system is demonstrated through experiments on finger electrical stimulation sensitivity zones, as well as applications in interactive gaming and robotic arm teleoperation. This system paves the way for new advancements in bidirectional tactile interaction and its broader applications.</description>

      <title>RedMotion: Motion Prediction via Redundancy Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RedMotion, a transformer model for motion prediction in self-driving vehicles that learns environment representations via redundancy reduction. Our first type of redundancy reduction is induced by an internal transformer decoder and reduces a variable-sized set of local road environment tokens, representing road graphs and agent data, to a fixed-sized global embedding. The second type of redundancy reduction is obtained by self-supervised learning and applies the redundancy reduction principle to embeddings generated from augmented views of road environments. Our experiments reveal that our representation learning approach outperforms PreTraM, Traj-MAE, and GraphDINO in a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, RedMotion achieves competitive results compared to HPTR or MTR++ in the Waymo Motion Prediction Challenge. Our open-source implementation is available at: https://github.com/kit-mrt/future-motion</description>

      <title>ActiveGAMER: Active GAussian Mapping through Efficient Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ActiveGAMER, an active mapping system that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve high-quality, real-time scene mapping and exploration. Unlike traditional NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and restrict active mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS, allowing effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that dynamically identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as Replica and MP3D highlight ActiveGAMER's effectiveness in active mapping tasks.</description>

      <title>AnyTouch: Learning Unified Static-Dynamic Representation across Multiple Visuo-tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visuo-tactile sensors aim to emulate human tactile perception, enabling robots to precisely understand and manipulate objects. Over time, numerous meticulously designed visuo-tactile sensors have been integrated into robotic systems, aiding in completing various tasks. However, the distinct data characteristics of these low-standardized visuo-tactile sensors hinder the establishment of a powerful tactile perception system. We consider that the key to addressing this issue lies in learning unified multi-sensor representations, thereby integrating the sensors and promoting tactile knowledge transfer between them. To achieve unified representation of this nature, we introduce TacQuad, an aligned multi-modal multi-sensor tactile dataset from four different visuo-tactile sensors, which enables the explicit integration of various sensors. Recognizing that humans perceive the physical environment by acquiring diverse tactile information such as texture and pressure changes, we further propose to learn unified multi-sensor representations from both static and dynamic perspectives. By integrating tactile images and videos, we present AnyTouch, a unified static-dynamic multi-sensor representation learning framework with a multi-level structure, aimed at both enhancing comprehensive perceptual abilities and enabling effective cross-sensor transfer. This multi-level architecture captures pixel-level details from tactile data via masked modeling and enhances perception and transferability by learning semantic-level sensor-agnostic features through multi-modal alignment and cross-sensor matching. We provide a comprehensive analysis of multi-sensor transferability, and validate our method on various datasets and in the real-world pouring task. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, exhibits outstanding static and dynamic perception capabilities across various sensors.</description>
