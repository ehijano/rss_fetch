      <title>An apologia for islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement islands have played a key role in the recent derivation of the Page curve and other progress on the black hole information problem. Arising from the inclusion of connected wormhole saddles in a gravitational replica trick, islands signal that degrees of freedom in the black hole interior are not microscopically independent of the exterior Hawking radiation. Islands were originally discovered in the context of AdS/CFT coupled to an external, nongravitating reservoir, where the coupling gives graviton excitations an anomalous boundary scaling dimension (or "mass"). It has been claimed in the literature that this mass is crucial for the existence of islands and even the Page curve itself. In this paper, however, we explain how entanglement islands can also appear in setups with massless gravitons and no external reservoir, giving a number of examples including the entanglement wedges of boundary CFT regions, of radiation at null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, and of radiation inside a semiclassical but gravitating spacetime. In each case, the Page curve is physically observable and can be determined with sufficiently careful experiments on many copies of the black hole. We give general arguments for the existence of gauge-invariant operators in gravity which are compactly supported to all orders in perturbation theory (whenever no isometries of the background spacetime exist) and refine a recently-proposed explicit construction of such operators. When applied to islands, these results -- together with entanglement wedge reconstruction -- guarantee that semiclassical operators in the island can be approximated by nonperturbative operators on the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Cross-Section Bootstrap: Unveiling the Froissart Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the integrated total scattering cross-section at \emph{finite} energies, expressed in terms of a single low-energy coefficient constrained by the non-perturbative S-matrix Bootstrap. At high energies, the bound is compared with proton-proton scattering data; at low energies, with numerical bootstrap results obtained by directly maximizing the cross-section. We conjecture that the amplitude saturating the cross-section at high energies lies at a strongly-coupled corner of the allowed space of low-energy parameters. This universal amplitude exhibits a rising total cross-section, a shrinking elastic differential cross-section with multiple diffractive minima, and a surprisingly rich spectrum of resonances aligning along Regge trajectories, including Pomeron-like and daughter trajectories, as well as unusual ``singular" trajectories in the forward limit which appear deeply interconnected with Froissart growth. Remarkably, the eikonal representation reveals that the scattering is localized within an annular region that slowly expands with energy, challenging the traditional ``disk" diffraction picture. Our results open the door to theoretical and phenomenological studies of \emph{soft} high-energy hadronic scattering via the S-matrix Bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Discretely Evanescent Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new UV-complete dark energy model which is \underbar{\it neither} a cosmological constant nor a slowly rolling scalar field. Our dark energy is the flux of a top form in a hidden sector gauge theory similar to QCD. The top form controls the vacuum energy generated by dark sector CP violation. Its flux discharges by the nucleation of membranes that source it. The tension and charge of the membranes are set by the chiral symmetry breaking scale $\sim 10^{-3} eV$, and the dark energy is a transient. It decays on the order of the current age of the universe. The decays decrease dark energy discretely and randomly, instead of gradually like rolling scalars. Since the decay rate is close to the present Hubble scale, $\Gamma \ga H_0^4$, in a time $\sim {\cal O}(1/H_0)$ the cosmic acceleration may even cease altogether.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Weyl fermion on an axion string in a finite lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain wall fermions use a $2n$-dimensional spacetime defect embedded in $(2n+1)$-dimensional spacetime to realize massless lattice Dirac fermions. Recent work has extended this idea to realize a single unpaired Weyl fermion in a finite lattice. Here, we realize the same using a $2n$-dimensional string defect embedded in $(2n+2)$-dimensional spacetime on a finite lattice for $n=1$. This string is a lattice version of the continuum axion string described in Callan-Harvey. Our results are obtained in a Hamiltonian formulation in Minkowski spacetime. Extending the results to Euclidean spacetime and to $n&gt;1$ is straightforward. This work has applications to lattice chiral gauge theories and axion cosmology.</description>

      <title>On the Physics of Higher Condensation Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of topological defects for finite Abelian symmetries in quantum field theories, and argue on physical grounds that they satisfy the definition of a higher fusion category proposed by Johnson-Freyd. Our primary focus is on the requirement of Karoubi completeness, i.e. the factorization conditions on higher condensation defects. We demonstrate this on a tree of such defects, constructed by successive higher gauging, explicitly using Lagrangian techniques in a concrete four-dimensional example, before turning to more general field theories. Along the way we also comment on the phenomenon where decoupled topological field theories appear as fusion coefficients. We further discuss the categorical role of anomalies, and how they may affect the properties of (higher) condensation defects.</description>

      <title>Glueball-fermion hard scattering from type IIB superstring theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the glueball-fermion hard-scattering amplitude from the dilaton-dilatino closed string scattering amplitude in type IIB superstring theory, in the framework of the gauge/string theory duality. We investigate its high-energy scaling at fixed angle and also in the Regge limit. We derive the leading and sub-leading terms contributing to the scattering cross section. This dual calculation of the glueball-fermion scattering amplitude is particularly interesting since it involves the scattering of two different types of external states. We calculate explicitly some angular integrals for two scalar spherical harmonics and two spinor spherical harmonics on the five-sphere, leading to selection rules.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior. Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Fokker-Planck Equation in Schwarzschild Spacetime: A Supersymmetric Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have re-analyzed the dynamics of the thermal potential within Schwarzschild spacetime by employing the Fokker-Planck equation. We demonstrate that the Fokker-Planck equation reduces to a simplified form equivalent to a scaled quantum mechanical problem with a harmonic oscillator potential. In this framework, we highlight an interesting correspondence between supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and the Fokker-Planck dynamics associated with the Schwarzschild metric. Utilizing the isospectral deformation, an intrinsic feature of SUSY QM, we derive a family of one-parameter isospectral potentials. Notably, this new class of potentials exhibits the same energy spectrum as the original harmonic oscillator potential, but with distinct wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir effect in the presence of compact dimensions in field theory with Lorentz invariant violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of the Lorentz invariant violation on the Casimir energy and pressure of the massive fermion field in the presence of the compact dimensions with topological $R^4\times S^1$, referring to the Kaluza-Klein model. In the system, the Dirac field is confined between two parallel plates with the geometry described by MIT bag boundary conditions, and the compactified dimension satisfies quasi-periodic boundary conditions. We investigate two directions of the Lorentz violation, namely, space- and time-like. The results reveal that in the space-like vector case, the Lorentz violation's strength and the extra dimension affect the Casimir energy and pressure. In contrast, in the time-like vector case, they are only affected by the extra dimension. We also propose an indirect method to estimate the size of the extra dimension by comparing the frequency shift of the massless fermionic case to that of the scaled experimental data for the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Cardy Entropy of Charged and Rotating Asymptotically AdS and Lifshitz Solutions with a Generalized Chern-Simons term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional gravity model that includes (non-linear) Maxwell and Chern-Simons-like terms, allowing for the existence of electrically charged rotating black hole solutions with a static electromagnetic potential. We verify that a Cardy-like formula, based not on central charges but on the mass of the uncharged and non-spinning soliton, obtained via a double Wick rotation of the neutral static black hole solution, accurately reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Furthermore, we show that a slight generalization of this model, incorporating a dilatonic field and extra gauge fields, admits charged and rotating black hole solutions with asymptotic Lifshitz behavior. The entropy of these solutions can likewise be derived using the Cardy-like formula, with the Lifshitz-type soliton serving as the ground state. Based on these results, we propose a generalized Cardy-like formula that successfully reproduces the semiclassical entropy in all the studied cases.</description>

      <title>On internal mechanical properties of Electroweak Magnetic Monopoles and their effects on stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering properties of the energy-momentum tensor of the electroweak magnetic monopole and its Born-Infeld extension, we attempt to make comments on the stability of these configurations. Specifically, we perform a study of the behaviour of the so-called internal force and pressure of these extended field-theoretic solitonic objects, which are derived from the energy-momentum tensor. Our method is slightly different from the so-called Laue's criterion for stability of nuclear matter, a local form of which had been proposed and applied in the earlier literature to the `t Hooft-Polyakov (HP) magnetic monopole, and found to be violated.By applying our method first to HP monopole, we also observe that, despite its topological stability, the total (finite) internal force (which has only radial components) is directed inwards, towards the centre of the monopole, which would imply instability. Thus this mechanical criterion for stability is arguably violated in the case of the HP monopole, as is the local version of Laue's criterion. The criterion is satisfied for the short-range part of the energy momentum tensor, in which the long-range part, due to the massless photon of the U(1) subgroup, is subtracted. Par contrast, the total internal force of the Cho-Maison (CM) electroweak monopole has both radial and angular components, which diverge at the origin, leading to rotational instabilities. Finally, by studying finite-energy extensions of the CM, either with non-minimal Higgs couplings with the hypercharge sector or hypercharge Born-Infeld type models, we find that the total force, integrated over space, is finite, but it has also angular components in the Born-Infeld case. The latter feature is interpreted as indicating that the Born-Infeld-CM monopole might be subject to rotations upon the action of perturbations, but it does not necessarily imply instabilities of the configuration.</description>

      <title>Examples for BPS solitons destabilized by quantum effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the leading quantum corrections to the energies of solitons which are constructed from BPS equations for two scalar fields in one space dimension. A particular feature of the considered models is that there are several translationally invariant ground states. We call them primary and secondary vacua. The former are those that are asymptotically assumed by the topologically stable solitons. Therefore the primary vacua fully determine the classical energy and solitons that occupy a secondary vacuum in finite but eventually large portions of space are classically degenerate. Then the quantum corrections to the energy are decisive for the energetically favored soliton. We find that the leading quantum correction to the energy is not bounded from below and that this correction is the more negative the larger the region is in which the soliton approaches a secondary vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new method to calculate the full microlocal description of singularities of Feynman integrals. This is done by associating a unique constructible function to the system of partial differential equations (PDEs) annihilating the integral and from this function the singularities can directly be read-off. This function can be constructed explicitly even if the system of PDEs is unknown and describes both the location of the singularities and the number of master integrals on them. Our framework is flexible enough to preform the calculation in any of the Lee-Pomeransky, Feynman, or momentum representations.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly in inhomogeneous systems with nontrivial momentum space topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the chiral anomaly for systems with a wide class of Hermitian Dirac operators ${Q}$ in 4D Euclidean spacetime. We suppose that $ Q$ is not necessarily linear in derivatives and also that it contains a coordinate inhomogeneity unrelated to that of the external gauge field. We use the covariant Wigner-Weyl calculus (in which the Wigner transformed two point Greens function belongs to the two-index tensor representation of the gauge group) and point splitting regularization to calculate the global expression for the anomaly. The Atiyah-Singer theorem can be applied to relate the anomaly to the topological index of $ Q$. We show that the topological index factorizes (under certain assumptions) into the topological invariant $\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int \text{tr}(F\wedge F)$ (composed of the gauge field strength) multiplied by a topological invariant $N_3$ in phase space. The latter is responsible for the topological stability of Fermi points/Fermi surfaces and is related to the conductivity of the chiral separation effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate on the diffeomorphism invariance of the effective gravitational action, focusing in particular on the path integral measure. In the literature, two different measures are mainly considered, the Fradkin-Vilkovisky and the Fujikawa one. With the help of detailed calculations, we show that, despite claims to the contrary, the Fradkin-Vilkovisky measure is diffeomorphism invariant, while the Fujikawa measure is not. In particular, we see that, contrary to naive expectations, the presence of $g^{00}$ factors in the Fradkin-Vilkovisky measure is necessary to ensure the invariance of the effective gravitational action. We also comment on results recently appeared in the literature, and show that formal calculations can easily miss delicate points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a technique to construct gapped lattice models using defects in topological field theory. We illustrate with 2+1 dimensional models, for example Chern-Simons theories. These models are local, though the state space is not necessarily a tensor product of vector spaces over the complex numbers. The Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting projections. We also give a topological field theory construction of Levin-Wen models.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions at small spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In perturbation theory, the anomalous dimensions of twist-two operators have poles at negative or small positive integer values of spin and therefore must be resummed at these points. It was observed earlier that a certain quadratic combination of the anomalous dimensions remains finite at the right-most singularities, providing an efficient tool for resummation. In this paper, we analyze the small-spin behavior of the anomalous dimensions for all types of twist-two operators in the $O(N)$-symmetric $\varphi^4$ model at the four-loop level, in the complex $\varphi^3$ model at the three-loop level, and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model at the two-loop level. We find that the behavior of the anomalous dimensions at singular points is consistent with theoretical expectations, and we present expressions for the resummed anomalous dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ super Yang--Mills theory on an AdS background. We propose that the boundary conditions that preserve the AdS super-isometries are determined by maximizing the real part of the AdS partition function $F_{\text{AdS}}=-\log Z_{\text{AdS}}$. At weak coupling $\Lambda L \ll 1$ the maximization singles out the Dirichlet boundary condition with an $SU(2)$ boundary global symmetry, corresponding to the classical vacuum at the origin of the Coulomb branch with fully un-higgsed gauge group. We find that for $\Lambda L \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ new boundary conditions are favored, with gauge-group higgsed down to $U(1)$, matching the expectation from the flat space limit. We use supersymmetric localization to compute $Z_{\text{AdS}}$ nonperturbatively. We further provide evidence for a relation between $F_{\text{AdS}}$ and the $\mathcal{N}=2$ prepotential in AdS background.</description>

      <title>The hyperplane string, RCFTs, and the swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravity features BPS strings whose properties encode highly nontrivial information about the parent 6d theory. We focus on a distinguished set of theories whose string charge lattice is one-dimensional. In geometric theories, the generator of the lattice arises from a D3 brane wrapping the hyperplane class in $\mathbb{P}^2$. This hyperplane string is expected to remain stable even when one ventures beyond the geometric regime where it becomes challenging to verify which candidate 6d theories belong to the swampland. We identify five 6d models which from the perspective of the hyperplane string deviate the most from being geometric. For these theories we are able to provide an exact description of the left-moving sector of the hyperplane string worldsheet in terms of a rational conformal field theory and provide evidence for their consistency. In one instance, using RCFT methods we are able to determine the elliptic genus and find that in the unflavored limit it matches with the elliptic genus of geometric models. We argue that the non-geometric model is connected to geometric ones via a sequence of Higgsing transitions. These results lead us to formulate a proposal relating the quantum corrected moduli space of the hyperplane string CFT with a region of the landscape of 6d $(1,0)$ quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Veneziano Amplitude in any Dimension and a Virasoro-Shapiro Partial Amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the Veneziano partial amplitude of bosonic string theory admits a generalization to world-(hyper)surfaces of any dimension $d$. In particular, for $d=2$, by carving up the worldsheet integral according to stipulations imposed on conformal cross ratios, the Virasoro-Shapiro full amplitude can be decomposed into a sum of three partial amplitudes. The amplitudes obtained on generalizing the Veneziano amplitude all contain tachyons. To explore candidate tachyon-free and supersymmetric versions of these amplitudes, a new bootstrap principle is introduced and applied, which demands that towers of residues alternate between all-even and all-odd spin partial waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the strong graded locality of all unitary minimal W-algebras, so that they give rise to irreducible graded-local conformal nets. Among these unitary vertex superalgebras, up to taking tensor products with free fermion vertex superalgebras, there are the unitary Virasoro vertex algebras (N=0) and the unitary N=1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras. Accordingly, we have a uniform construction that gives, besides the already known N=0,1,2 super-Virasoro nets, also the new N=3,4 super-Virasoro nets. All strongly rational unitary minimal W-algebras give rise to previously known completely rational graded-local conformal nets and we conjecture that the converse is also true. We prove this conjecture for all unitary W-algebras corresponding to the N=0,1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though an anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacuum, corresponding to a negative cosmological constant (NCC), can be not responsible for the acceleration of current universe, it might coexist with one evolving positive dark energy component at low redshift, as well as with early dark energy around the recombination to solve the Hubble tension. In this paper, we investigate the scenario with one AdS vacuum around the recombination and one at low redshift, and from both current observational and theoretical perspectives preliminarily explore the possibility that the universe experienced a landscape with multiple AdS vacua since matter-radiation equality.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes in Kerr spacetime as a 2D Eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Kerr black hole using a numerical approach exploiting a representation of the Teukolsky equation as a $2D$ elliptic partial differential equation. By combining the hyperboloidal framework with a $m$-mode decomposition, we recast the QNM problem into a genuine eigenvalue problem for each azimuthal mode. This formulation enables the simultaneous extraction of multiple QNMs, traditionally labelled by overtone number $n$ and angular index $\ell$, without requiring prior assumptions about their structure. We advocate for a simplified notation in which each overtone is uniquely labelled by a single index $q$, thereby avoiding the conventional but artificial distinction between regular and mirror modes. We compare two distinct hyperboloidal gauges-radial fixing and Cauchy horizon fixing-and demonstrate that, despite their different geometric properties and behaviour in the extremal limit, they yield numerical values for the QNM spectra with comparable accuracy and exponential convergence. Moreover, we show that strong gradients observed near the horizon in the extremal Kerr regime are coordinate artefacts of specific slicing rather than physical features. Finally, we investigate the angular structure of the QNM eigenfunctions and show that the $m$-mode approach allows flexible projection onto both spin-weighted spheroidal and spherical harmonic bases. These results underscore the robustness and versatility of the hyperboloidal $m$-mode method as a foundation for future studies of QNM stability, pseudospectra, and mode excitation in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may freeze-out and undergo composite assembly while decoupled from the Standard Model. In this secluded composite scenario, while individual dark matter particles may be too weakly-coupled to detect, the assembled composite can potentially be detected since its effective coupling scales with number of constituents. We examine models and observables for secluded composites, and in particular we investigate the cosmological abundance of the composite binding field, which is generated during freeze-out annihilation and secluded composite assembly. This binding field could be discovered as a new relativistic species in the early universe or through later interactions as a subdominant dark component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a modification of a recently developed numerical scheme for evolving spherically symmetric self-gravitating systems to include the effects of self-interacting dark matter. The approach is far more efficient than traditional N-body simulations and cross sections with different dependencies on velocity and scattering-angle are easily accommodated. To demonstrate, we provide results of a simulation, which runs quickly on a personal computer, that shows the expected initial flattening of the inner region of an NFW halo as well as the later gravothermal collapse instability that leads to a dense core at the galactic center. We note that this approach can also be used, with some augmentation, to simulate the dynamics in globular clusters by modeling gravitational hard scattering as a self-interaction.</description>

      <title>The Luttinger Count is the Homotopy not the Physical Charge: Generalized Anomalies Characterize Non-Fermi Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Luttinger-Ward functional can be formulated as an operator insertion in the path integral and hence can be thought of as a generalized symmetry. The key result is that the associated charge, always quantized, defines the homotopy, not the physical charge. The disconnect between the two arises from divergences in the functional or equivalently zeros of the single-particle Green function. Such divergences produce an anomaly of the triangle-diagram type. As a result of this anomaly, we are able to account for the various deviations\cite{rosch,dave,altshuler,osborne,l3,l5} of the Luttinger count from the particle density. As a consequence, non-Fermi liquids can be classified generally by the well known anomaly structures in particle physics. Charges descending from generalized symmetries, as in the divergence of the Luttinger-Ward functional, are inherently non-local, their key experimental signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the spectral properties of the $4$-fermion Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with interaction sourced from a L\'evy Stable (fat-tailed) distribution. L\'evy random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the L\'evy Stable distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the L\'evy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity, in the absence of matter fields and using the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, is solvable both classically and quantum mechanically. This is achieved by using the conformal time as the time variable and the negative or positive of the inverse of the scale factor as configuration variable to write the classical equation of motion, which turns out to be the one of a free particle ($k=0$), a harmonic oscillator ($k=1$), and a repulsive oscillator ($k=-1$) in the real half-line. In all cases, the observable identified as the cosmological constant is six times the Hamiltonian. In particular, for a closed Universe ($k=1$), spacetime exhibits a cyclic evolution along which the scalar curvature is constant and finite, thereby avoiding singularities. The quantum theory is reached by using canonical quantization. We calculate the spectrum of the observable corresponding to the cosmological constant. Remarkably, for the closed Universe ($k=1$), the spectrum is discrete and positive while for flat ($k=0$) and open ($k=-1$) universes, the spectra are continuous. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle imposes limitations on the simultaneous measurement of the Hubble expansion (momentum variable) and the configuration variable. We also report the observable identified as the cosmological constant for inflaton, phantom and perfect fluids coupled to trace-free Einstein gravity in the FRW metric.</description>

      <title>Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. Such transitions are expected to be enhanced by more than ten orders of magnitude in the presence of the resonator, compared to transitions occurring in homogeneous space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Parity Violating Gravity Theories whose gravitational Lagrangian is a generic function of the scalar curvature and the parity odd curvature pseudoscalar, commonly known as the Holst (or Hojmann) term. Generalizing some previous results in the literature, we explicitly show that if the Hessian of this function is non-degenerate, the initial non-Riemannian Theory is on-shell equivalent to a metric Scalar-Tensor Theory. The generic form of the kinetic coupling function and the scalar potential of the resulting Theory are explicitly found and reported.</description>

Abstract: Light scalar or vector particles are among the most studied dark matter candidates. Yet, those are always described as scalar or vector fields. In this paper, we explore instead the embedding of the scalar particle in an antisymmetric rank-three tensor field, and the dark photon into an antisymmetric rank-two tensor field (a so-called Kalb-Ramond field), and construct minimal bases of effective interactions with Standard Model fields. Then, keeping phenomenological applications as our main objective, a number of theoretical aspects are clarified, in particular related to the impact of existing dualities among the corresponding free theories, and concerning their Stueckelberg representations. Besides, for the rank-two field, we present for the first time its full propagator, accounting for the possible presence of a pseudoscalar mass term. Thanks to these results, and with their different kinematics, gauge-invariant limits, and Lorentz properties, we show that these higher-form fields provide genuine alternative frameworks, with different couplings and expected signatures at low-energy or at colliders.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical evolution of a dynamically formed spherical black hole with an inner horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we obtain a numerical self-consistent spherical solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations representing the evaporation of a trapped region which initially has both an outer and an inner horizon. The classical matter source used is a static electromagnetic field, allowing for an approximately Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole as the initial configuration, where the charge sets the initial scale of the inner horizon. The semiclassical contribution is that of a quantum scalar field in the "in" vacuum state of gravitational collapse, as encoded by the renormalised stress-energy tensor in the spherical Polyakov approximation. We analyse the rate of shrinking of the trapped region, both from Hawking evaporation of the outer apparent horizon, as well as from an outward motion of the inner horizon. We also observe that a long-lived anti-trapped region forms below the inner horizon and slowly expands outward. A black-to-white-hole transition is thus obtained from purely semiclassical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant field strengths in $QCD$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge-invariant field strengths, defined as parallel transports to infinity of ordinary field strengths, naturally emerge in a few physical phenomena governed by $QCD$. One of them is confinement of colour. Despite the arbitrariness in their definition coming from the freedom in the choice of the path of the parallel transport to infinity, the request of differentiability with respect to the position $x$ strongly constrains their correlation functions. Strong constraints also come from translation and Lorentz invariance. Gauge invariant field strengths also appear in the non abelian Stokes theorem, and allow to understand basic properties of the vacuum by use of lattice data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charge fluctuations of a family of stochastic charged cellular automata away from the deterministic single-file limit and obtain the exact typical charge probability distributions, known to be anomalous, using hydrodynamics. The cellular automata considered are examples of linearly degenerate systems where two distinct mechanisms of diffusion, namely normal and convective diffusion, coexist. Our formalism, based on macroscopic fluctuation theory, allows us to describe current fluctuations stemming from these two diffusive processes, and we expect it to be applicable to generic linearly degenerate systems. The derived probability distributions match the exact microscopic result and numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new conformal symmetry of stationary, axisymmetric Kerr perturbations. This symmetry is exact but non-geometric (or "hidden"), and each of its generators has an associated infinite family of eigenstate solutions. Tidal perturbations of a black hole form an irreducible highest-weight representation of this conformal group, while the tidal response fields live in a different such representation. This implies that black holes have no tidal deformability, or vanishing Love numbers.</description>

      <title>Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Complex crystallographic reflection groups and Seiberg-Witten integrable systems: rank 1 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generalisations of the elliptic Calogero--Moser systems associated to complex crystallographic groups in accordance to [1]. In our previous work [2], we proposed these systems as candidates for Seiberg--Witten integrable systems of certain SCFTs. Here we examine that proposal for complex crystallographic groups of rank one. Geometrically, this means considering elliptic curves $T^2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_m$-symmetries, $m=2,3,4,6$, and Poisson deformations of the orbifolds $(T^2\times\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_m$. The $m=2$ case was studied in [2], while $m=3,4,6$ correspond to Seiberg--Witten integrable systems for the rank 1 Minahan--Nemeshansky SCFTs of type $E_{6,7,8}$. This allows us to describe the corresponding elliptic fibrations and the Seiberg--Witten differential in a compact elegant form. This approach also produces quantum spectral curves for these SCFTs, which are given by Fuchsian ODEs with special properties.</description>

      <title>Mapping 1+1-dimensional black hole thermodynamics to finite volume effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both black hole thermodynamics and finite volume effects in quantum field theory violate the null energy condition. Motivated by this, we compare thermodynamic features between two $1+1$-dimensional systems: (i) a scalar field confined to a periodic spatial interval of length $a$ and tunneling between two degenerate vacua; (ii) a dilatonic black hole at temperature $T$ in the presence of matter fields. If we identify $a\propto T^{-1}$, we find similar thermodynamic behaviour, which suggests some deeper connection arising from the presence of non-trivial boundary conditions in both systems. We then extend our results to $2+1$ and $3+1$-dimensions and, although a more complete study is necessary, the connection found in $1+1$-dimensions seems to be valid in higher dimensions too.</description>

      <title>Exploring Confinement in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Yang-Mills theory on four dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. The Dirichlet boundary condition cannot exist at arbitrarily large radius because it would give rise to colored asymptotic states in flat space. As observed in [1] this implies a deconfinement-confinement transition as the radius is increased. We gather hints on the nature of this transition using perturbation theory. We compute the anomalous dimensions of the lightest scalar operators in the boundary theory, finding that the singlet gets a larger negative anomalous dimension compared to the adjoint. We also compute the correction to the coefficient $C_J$ and we estimate that the singlet operator reaches marginality before the value of the coupling at which $C_J=0$. These results favor the scenario of merger and annihilation as the most promising candidate for the transition. For the Neumann boundary condition, the lightest scalar operator is found to have a positive anomalous dimension, in agreement with the idea that this boundary condition extrapolates smoothly to flat space. The perturbative calculations are made possible by a drastic simplification of the gauge field propagator in Fried-Yennie gauge. We also derive a general result for the leading-order anomalous dimension of the displacement operator for a generic perturbation in Anti-de Sitter, showing that it is related to the beta function of bulk couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a theory of fermions interacting with a (in general, non-Abelian) gauge field. The theory is assumed to be essentially inhomogeneous, which might be provided by non-trivial background fields interacting with both fermions and gauge bosons. For this theory, a version of Wigner-Weyl calculus is developed, in which the Wigner transformation of the fermion Green function belongs to a matrix representation of gauge group. We demonstrate the power of the proposed formalism through the representation of responses of vector and axial currents to the gauge field strength through the topological invariants composed of the Wigner transformed two-point Green functions. This way a new family of non-dissipative transport phenomena is introduced. In particular, we discuss the non-Abelian versions of the chiral separation effect and of the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: : In this note, we study an extra dimension effect on the black hole chemistry in the 8-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Maxwell theory. The base spacetime contains 4- dimensional compact manifolds and an instanton on top of those. We demonstrate how the extra dimensions affect the phase transition and viable black hole sizes in the 4-dimensional Einstein frame through the black hole chemistry. We focus on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes for the effective 4-dimensional model obtained by a dimensional reduction. The extra-dimension size determines thermodynamic pressure, and the thermodynamic volume is roughly the horizon size of black holes. Thus, the extra dimension and black hole sizes are related as a conjugate pair of thermodynamic variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N&gt;2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair -- the detailed derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a very detailed derivation of solutions describing hairy black holes within the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory, which were previously reported in \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.171402}{Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 171402}. These black holes support a strong magnetic field that polarizes the electroweak vacuum and creates a condensate of massive fields carrying superconducting currents along the black hole horizon. The currents, in turn, generate a ``corona'' of magnetic vortex segments attached to the horizon at both ends. The condensate and corona together constitute the black hole hair. The extremal solutions approach, in the far field, the magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration, with a total mass that is {\it lower} than the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate. This makes the removal of the hair energetically unfavorable. The maximally hairy black holes exhibit masses comparable to terrestrial values, with approximately 11\% of their total mass stored in the hair. Given that these solutions arise within a well-tested theoretical framework, they are likely to have physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Thermal Product Formula for Shear Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in [arXiv:2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in five-dimensional AdS where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.</description>

      <title>Boundary Energy-Momentum Tensors for Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 3D and 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes near future null infinity endowed with the most general allowed Carroll geometry. We define a boundary energy-momentum tensor by varying the on-shell action with respect to the Carroll metric data. This requires adding counterterms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We show that, in 4D, the shear is on par with the Carroll metric data. Their combined response defines a boundary energy-momentum-news complex whose diffeomorphism Ward identity is equivalent to the Bondi mass and angular momentum loss equations. Weyl invariance leads to an identity for the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and local Carroll boosts are anomalous in 3D and in 4D.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bremsstrahlung in Black-Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$: Quadratic-in-Spin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are employing a supersymmetric variant of the worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) formalism to compute the far-field momentum-space gravitational waveform emitted during the scattering of two spinning black holes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our results are accurate up to quadratic-in-spin contributions, which means we report for the very first time the waveform observable at the order $\mathcal{O}(G^3\mathcal{S}^2)$. Our computation is based on mapping $n$-body tree-level amplitudes in such a way that we can obtain the $(n-2)$-loop two-body waveform integrand. We discuss in detail this procedure and highlight the similarity of the resulting structures with those obtained in the scattering-amplitude approach. As a by product of our computational approach, we also obtain, for the first time, the leading-order waveform for three-body scattering of spinning black holes. We validated our results in various ways but most notably, we find exact agreement for the NLO waveform integrand obtained from the WQFT and the classical limit of scattering amplitudes in QFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, It is of interest the derivation of the LSZ rules in this context, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks, due to the non standard oscillator algebra and the redefinitions of the states.This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also find an interesting relation between the four dimensional gravitational constant and the Taub-NUT charge. The result is derived from classical field equations in Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions of which form the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave constraints on the primordial black hole dominated early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational waves (GWs) induced by the density fluctuations due to inhomogeneous distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the case where PBHs eventually dominate and reheat the universe by Hawking evaporation. The initial PBH density fluctuations are isocurvature in nature. We find that most of the induced GWs are generated right after evaporation, when the universe transits from the PBH dominated era to the radiation dominated era and the curvature perturbation starts to oscillate wildly. The strongest constraint on the amount of the produced GWs comes from the big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). We improve previous constraints on the PBH fraction and find that it cannot exceed $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, this maximum fraction decreases as the mass increases and reaches $10^{-9}$ for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 5\times10^8 {\rm g}$, which is the largest mass allowed by the BBN constraint on the reheating temperature. Considering that PBH may cluster above a given clustering scale, we also derive a lower bound on the scale of clustering. Interestingly, the GW spectrum for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^4 -10^8 {\rm g}$ enters the observational window of LIGO and DECIGO and could be tested in the future. Although we focus on the PBH dominated early universe in this paper, our methodology is applicable to any model with early isocurvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Quantum Quenches of Conformal Field Theory with Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to calculate generic time-dependent correlation functions for inhomogeneous quantum quenches in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) induced by sudden Hamiltonian deformations that modulate the energy density inhomogeneously. Our work particularly focuses on the effects of spatial boundaries, which have remained unresolved by previous analytical methods. For generic post-quench Hamiltonian, we develop a generic method to calculate the correlations by mirroring the system, which otherwise are Euclidean path integrals in complicated spacetime geometries difficult to calculate. On the other hand, for a special class of inhomogeneous post-quench Hamiltonians, including the M\"obius and sine-square-deformation Hamiltonians, we show that the quantum quenches exhibit simple boundary effects calculable from Euclidean path integrals in a straightforward strip spacetime geometry. Applying our method to the time evolution of entanglement entropy, we find that for generic cases, the entanglement entropy shows discontinuities (shockwave fronts) propagating from the boundaries.In contrast, such discontinuities are absent in cases with simple boundary effects. We verify that our generic CFT formula matches well with numerical calculations from free fermion tight-binding models for various quench scenarios.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of the dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and of a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks [fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$] in this framework is also considered.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Propagation in a Geometric Condensate in Starobinsky Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new paradigm for cosmology: a time dependent scalar condensate background originated from the quadratic $(R + \alpha R^2)$ Starobinski model, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\alpha$ the coupling constant. In weak gravity limit the system decouples into a conventional graviton and a higher derivative scalar. It was shown earlier through works from our group, \cite{ssg,sg,us}, that the latter can sustain an oscillatory lowest energy configuration or a {\it{Geometric Condensate}} as it consists entirely of metric degrees of freedom. In the present work, we study Gravitational Wave propagation in this condensate background. We show that the explicit time dependent nature of the condensate can generate curvature and radiation-like contributions in the scale factor evolution in FLRW cosmology. Subsequently the condensate leaves its signature on the Gravitational Wave profile as it propagates in the condensate modified FLRW spacetime. The wave profile is calculated analytically in terms of Whittaker functions. The main novelty of the Geometric Condensate scheme is that no external (condensate) matter from outside has been considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the ideas behind the duality web to construct numerous conformal field theories mediating the phase transitions between various symmetry broken and topological phases. In particular we obtain the full field theory version of the Kennedy Tasaki transformation, mapping a gapless theory mediating a topological phase transition of symmetry protected topological orders to a standard symmetry breaking one in a 1+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four. Some of these are gapless symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>The massive BMS character in 3D quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the one-loop partition function for three-dimensional quantum gravity in a finite-radius thermal twisted flat space with a conical defect, reproducing the massive BMS$_3$ character. We perform the computation in both discrete and continuum geometry formulations, showing consistency between them. In the discrete case, we integrate out bulk degrees of freedom in a Regge gravity framework, while in the continuum, we construct a dual non-local boundary field theory encoding geodesic length fluctuations. Our study shows that the additional modes of the massive character, compared to the vacuum case, originate from the explicit breaking of radial diffeomorphism symmetry by the defect. This provides a concrete geometric mechanism in Regge gravity, tracing the appearance of massive BMS$_3$ particles to diffeomorphism breaking by conical defects, and highlights the broader relevance of discrete geometry approaches to quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Affine Extensions of the Raychaudhuri Equation in the K-essence Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new avenue of the Raychaudhuri Equation (RE) by introducing a non-affine parametrization within the k-essence framework. This modification accounts for non-geodesic flow curves, leading to emergent repulsive effects in cosmic evolution. Using a DBI-type k-essence Lagrangian, we derive a modified RE and demonstrate its ability to address the Hubble tension while predicting a natural emergence of a dynamical dark energy equation of state. Our Bayesian analysis, constrained by cosmological data, supports the theoretical scaling relation of the k-essence field ($\dot{\phi}$) and the cosmic scale factor ($a$). Furthermore, we reinterpret the modified RE as an anti-damped harmonic oscillator, we found a caustic avoidance signature, it may reveal classical or quantum-like effects in cosmic expansion. These results suggest a deep connection between scalar field dynamics and modified gravity, offering new perspectives on the nature of the expansion history of the universe.</description>

      <title>Energy Density Functional of Confined Quarks: an Improved Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a robust framework for modeling interacting many-body systems, including the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. Many models, however, rely on energy functionals based on assumptions that have not been rigorously validated. We critically analyze a commonly used ansatz for confinement, where the energy functional scales with density as $U \propto n^{\frac{2}{3}}$ . Our findings, derived from a systematic non-local energy functional, reveal that this scaling does not capture the dynamics of confinement. Instead, the energy functional evolves from $n^2$ at low densities to $n$ at high densities, governed by an infrared cutoff. These results suggest that models relying on such assumptions should be revisited to ensure more reliable EoS construction.</description>

      <title>Assessing cosmological evidence for non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.6$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Beta function without UV divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <title>Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</description>

      <title>Predictability of quantum observables: Applications in QKD and top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify and optimize the predictability of local observables in bipartite quantum systems by employing the Bayes risk and the inference variance, two measures rooted in statistical learning theory. Specifically, we minimized these quantities when the prediction is improved by an additional quantum system, providing analytical expressions for arbitrary two-qubit states, and showcasing a connection with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. Then, we embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, yielding asymptotically higher secure-key rates than standard BB84 under realistic noise. We applied these results to Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and spin correlation in top-antitop quark pairs from high-energy collisions.</description>
