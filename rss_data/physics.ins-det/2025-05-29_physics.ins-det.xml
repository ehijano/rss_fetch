      <title>A Silicon Microstrip Detector for Power-Limited and Large Sensitive Area Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A silicon microstrip detector (SSD) has been developed to have state of the art spatial resolution and a large sensitive area under stringent power constraints. The design incorporates three floating strips with their bias resistors inserted between two aluminum readout strips. Beam test measurements with the single sensor confirmed that this configuration achieves a total detection efficiency of $99.8 \, \%$ and spatial resolution $7.6 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ for MIPs. A double-$\eta$ algorithm was developed to optimize hit position reconstruction for this SSD. The design can be adapted for large area silicon detectors.</description>

      <title>Innovative DC-coupled Resistive Silicon Detector for 4D tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past 10 years, two design innovations, the introduction of low internal gain (LGAD) and of resistive read-out (RSD), have radically changed the performance of silicon detectors. The LGAD mechanism, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by about a factor of 20, leads to improved time resolution (typically 30 ps for a 50-$\mu$m thick sensor), while resistive read-out, sharing the collected charge among read-out electrodes, leads to excellent spatial resolution even using large pixels (about 15 $\mu$m for 450-$\mu$m pixel size).
  This contribution outlines the design strategy and presents the first performance results of the latest evolution of silicon sensors for 4D tracking, the DC-coupled Resistive Silicon Detector (DC-RSD). The DC-RSD is a thin LGAD with a DC-coupled resistive read-out. This design leads to signal containment within a predetermined number of electrodes using isolating trenches (TI technology). Several test structures and application-oriented devices have been implemented in the wafer layout. The sensors, produced at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in the framework of the 4DSHARE project, have been characterized with a laser TCT system and recently tested at DESY with an electron beam. The study of this first prototype production will provide us with immediate feedback on the soundness of the DC-RSD concepts.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Correlation of Spacetime Fluctuations in Laser Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime fluctuations (SFs), a common feature of different proposed gravity models, could be detected using laser interferometers. In the search for SFs, a correspondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models is needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for identifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a correspondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers. We consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay behaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our approach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-P\'erot arm cavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such as the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected interferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for each class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale instruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes of SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on the nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that LIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.</description>

      <title>A Transition Edge Sensor Operated in Coincidence with a High Sensitivity Athermal Phonon Sensor for Photon Coupled Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental searches for axions or dark photons that couple to the standard model photon require photosensors with low noise, broadband sensitivity, and near zero backgrounds. Here, we introduce an experimental architecture, in which a small photon sensor, in our case a Transition Edge Sensor (TES) with a photon energy resolution $\sigma_\gamma = 368.4 \pm 0.4$ meV, is colocated on the same substrate as a large high sensitivity athermal phonon sensor (APS) with a phonon energy resolution $\sigma_\mathrm{phonon} = 701 \pm 2$ meV. We show that single 3.061 eV photons absorbed in the photon-sensing TES deposit $\sim$35\% of their energy in the electronic system of the TES, while $\sim$26\% of the photon energy leaks out of the photon-sensing TES during the downconversion process and becomes absorbed by the APS. Backgrounds, which we associate with the broadly observed ``low energy excess'' (LEE), are observed to be largely coupled to either the TES (``singles'' LEE), or phonon system, (``shared'' LEE). At high energies, these backgrounds can be efficiently discriminated from TES photon absorption events, while at low energies, their misidentification as photon events is well modeled. With significant sensitivity improvements to both the TES and APS, this coincidence technique could be used to suppress backgrounds in bosonic dark matter searches down to energies near the superconducting bandgap of the sensor.</description>

      <title>Muon identification with Deep Neural Network in the Belle II K-Long and Muon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon identification is crucial for elementary particle physics experiments. At the Belle II experiment, muons and pions with momenta greater than 0.7 GeV/c are distinguished by their penetration ability through the $K_L$ and Muon (KLM) sub-detector, which is the outermost sub-detector of Belle II. In this paper, we first discuss the possible room for $\mu/\pi$ identification performance improvement and then present a new method based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). This DNN model utilizes the KLM hit pattern variables as the input and thus can digest the penetration information better than the current algorithm. We test the new method in simulation and find that the pion fake rate (specificity) is reduced from 4.1% to 1.6% at a muon efficiency (recall) of 90%.</description>
