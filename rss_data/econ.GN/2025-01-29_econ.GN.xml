      <title>Financial constraints, risk sharing, and optimal monetary policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I characterize optimal government policy in a sticky-price economy with different types of consumers and endogenous financial constraints in the banking and entrepreneurial sectors. The competitive equilibrium allocation is constrained inefficient due to a pecuniary externality implicit in the collateral constraint and other externalities arising from consumer type heterogeneity. These externalities can be corrected with appropriate fiscal instruments. Independently of the availability of such instruments, optimal monetary policy aims to achieve price stability in the long run and approximate price stability in the short run, as in the conventional New Keynesian environment. Compared to the competitive equilibrium, the constrained efficient allocation significantly improves between-agent risk sharing, approaching the unconstrained Pareto optimum and leading to sizable welfare gains. Such an allocation has lower leverage in the banking and entrepreneurial sectors and is less prone to the boom-bust financial crises and zero-lower-bound episodes observed occasionally in the decentralized economy.</description>

      <title>Emission impossible: Balancing Environmental Concerns and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to examine how carbon pricing policies influence inflation and to estimate the policy-driven impact on goods prices from achieving net-zero emissions. Firms control emissions by adjusting production, abating, or purchasing permits, and these strategies determine emissions reductions that affect the consumer price index. We first examine an emissions-regulated economy, solving the market equilibrium under any dynamic allocation of allowances set by the regulator. Next, we analyze a regulator balancing emission reduction and inflation targets, identifying the optimal allocation when accounting for both environmental and inflationary concerns. By adjusting penalties for deviations from these targets, we demonstrate how regulatory priorities shape equilibrium outcomes. Under reasonable model parameterisation, even when considerable emphasis is placed on maintaining inflation at acceptable levels or grant lower priority to emissions reduction targets, the costs associated with emission deviations still exceed any savings from marginally lower inflation. Emission reduction goals should remain the primary focus for policymakers.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Hesitancy and Digital Literacy: Evidence from the European countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study documents the relationship between computer skills/digital literacy and influenza vaccination take-up among older adults in Europe during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe, we find a positive partial association between influenza vaccination take-up and two indicators of computer skills/digital literacy, self-assessed pre-pandemic computer skills and having used a computer at work in any pre-pandemic job. We do not estimate significant behavioural changes for individuals with better computer skills that may have been driven by spillover effects from the pandemic experience.</description>

      <title>Articulating the role of nuclear energy in the circular economy of China: A machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear energy is increasingly recognized as a critical component of circular economy frameworks due to its capacity to provide a stable, low-carbon energy source. Reducing dependency on fossil fuels promotes sustainable practices and aligns with circular economy goals such as resource efficiency, pollution reduction, and waste minimization. The existing literature has primarily focused on the contribution of nuclear energy to decarbonization, whereas the potential of nuclear energy in facilitating a circular economy has been largely neglected. In light of this context, this paper explores the impact of nuclear energy on the circular economy, thereby offering strong econometric evidence. The study used the advanced econometric tool Dynamic Auto-Regressive Distributive Lag (DYNARDL) method for empirical estimation to obtain long- and short-run estimates. The regression estimates, derived from a sample of China spanning 1990 to 2017, support the hypothesis that nuclear energy negatively impacts the circular economy in both the long- and short-run. Advanced econometric tests confirm the stability of the models, homoscedasticity, and the absence of serial correlation, ensuring the reliability of our findings. The study emphasizes the importance of policy strategies, including expanding nuclear energy adoption, advancing environmental technologies, and the effective use of nuclear energy by integrating comprehensive datasets and methodologies; this paper provides a foundation for scalable and equitable solutions as China moves toward a greener and more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Volatility of Energy Transition Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to a cleaner energy mix, essential for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, will significantly increase demand for metals critical to renewable energy technologies. Energy Transition Metals (ETMs), including copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements, are indispensable for renewable energy generation and the electrification of global economies. However, their markets are characterized by high price volatility due to supply concentration, low substitutability, and limited price elasticity. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the price volatility of ETMs, a subset of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs). Using a combination of exploratory data analysis, data reduction, and visualization methods, we identify key features for accurate point and density forecasts. We evaluate various volatility models, including Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and Stochastic Volatility (SV) models, to determine their forecasting performance. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in ETM volatility patterns, which challenge standard groupings by data providers and geological classifications. The results contribute to the literature on CRM economics and commodity volatility, offering novel insights into the complex dynamics of ETM markets and the modeling of their returns and volatilities.</description>

      <title>Multicausal transport: barycenters and dynamic matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multivariate version of causal transport, which we name multicausal transport, involving several filtered processes among which causality constraints are imposed. Subsequently, we consider the barycenter problem for stochastic processes with respect to causal and bicausal optimal transport, and study its connection to specific multicausal transport problems. Attainment and duality of the aforementioned problems are provided. As an application, we study a matching problem in a dynamic setting where agent types evolve over time. We link this to a causal barycenter problem and thereby show existence of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Cyber Shadows: Neutralizing Security Threats with AI and Targeted Policy Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digital age, driven by the AI revolution, brings significant opportunities but also conceals security threats, which we refer to as cyber shadows. These threats pose risks at individual, organizational, and societal levels. This paper examines the systemic impact of these cyber threats and proposes a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that integrates AI-driven solutions, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), with targeted policy interventions. By combining technological and regulatory measures, we create a multilevel defense capable of addressing both direct threats and indirect negative externalities. We emphasize that the synergy between AI-driven solutions and policy interventions is essential for neutralizing cyber threats and mitigating their negative impact on the digital economy. Finally, we underscore the need for continuous adaptation of these strategies, especially in response to the rapid advancement of autonomous AI-driven attacks, to ensure the creation of secure and resilient digital ecosystems.</description>
