      <title>Know What You Don't Know: Uncertainty Calibration of Process Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach, performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.</description>

      <title>Attention-Bayesian Hybrid Approach to Modular Multiple Particle Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking multiple particles in noisy and cluttered scenes remains challenging due to a combinatorial explosion of trajectory hypotheses, which scales super-exponentially with the number of particles and frames. The transformer architecture has shown a significant improvement in robustness against this high combinatorial load. However, its performance still falls short of the conventional Bayesian filtering approaches in scenarios presenting a reduced set of trajectory hypothesis. This suggests that while transformers excel at narrowing down possible associations, they may not be able to reach the optimality of the Bayesian approach in locally sparse scenario. Hence, we introduce a hybrid tracking framework that combines the ability of self-attention to learn the underlying representation of particle behavior with the reliability and interpretability of Bayesian filtering. We perform trajectory-to-detection association by solving a label prediction problem, using a transformer encoder to infer soft associations between detections across frames. This prunes the hypothesis set, enabling efficient multiple-particle tracking in Bayesian filtering framework. Our approach demonstrates improved tracking accuracy and robustness against spurious detections, offering a solution for high clutter multiple particle tracking scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered CPI Prediction Inference with Online Text Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency, survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.</description>

      <title>Evasion Attacks Against Bayesian Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing interest in analyzing the behavior of machine learning systems against adversarial attacks. However, most of the research in adversarial machine learning has focused on studying weaknesses against evasion or poisoning attacks to predictive models in classical setups, with the susceptibility of Bayesian predictive models to attacks remaining underexplored. This paper introduces a general methodology for designing optimal evasion attacks against such models. We investigate two adversarial objectives: perturbing specific point predictions and altering the entire posterior predictive distribution. For both scenarios, we propose novel gradient-based attacks and study their implementation and properties in various computational setups.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Uncertainty in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has recently revealed the existence of scaling laws, demonstrating that model performance follows predictable trends based on dataset and model sizes. Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena emerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do similar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In identifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a straightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this case, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic uncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in over-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely unexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of scaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with respect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language tasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive uncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and ensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical utility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work provides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian approaches: "In many applications of deep learning we have so much data available: what do we need Bayes for?". Our findings show that "so much data" is typically not enough to make epistemic uncertainty negligible.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Quality of Denoising Diffusion Models in Wasserstein Distance: Noisy Score and Optimal Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling aims to produce new random examples from an unknown target distribution, given access to a finite collection of examples. Among the leading approaches, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) construct such examples by mapping a Brownian motion via a diffusion process driven by an estimated score function. In this work, we first provide empirical evidence that DDPMs are robust to constant-variance noise in the score evaluations. We then establish finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance that exhibit two key features: (i) they characterize and quantify the robustness of DDPMs to noisy score estimates, and (ii) they achieve faster convergence rates than previously known results. Furthermore, we observe that the obtained rates match those known in the Gaussian case, implying their optimality.</description>

      <title>A Deep Generative Model for the Simulation of Discrete Karst Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of discrete karst networks presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of the physicochemical processes occurring within various geological and hydrogeological contexts over extended periods. This complex interplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately linked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that represents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep learning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In this representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while edges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two main steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to learn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the graph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by previously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion probabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial coordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes features on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned statistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution, ensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential features of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst networks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the database, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows stochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of formations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such as flow and transport.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Models for Decision-Making Tasks with Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence. In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of the relationship between neural activity and behavior.</description>

      <title>Detecting malignant dynamics on very few blood sample using signature coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries have suggested that the promising avenue of using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in blood samples provides reasonable accuracy for cancer monitoring, with extremely low burden on the patient's side. It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms leading to DNA release from cells, such as apoptosis, necrosis or active secretion. One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring the dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer detection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g. in the company named GRAIL.
  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for detecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our approach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics of ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient testing procedures. Signature theory is a topic of growing interest in the Machine Learning community (see Chevyrev2016 and Fermanian2021), which is now recognised as a powerful feature extraction tool for irregularly sampled signals. The method proposed in the present paper is shown to correctly address the challenging problem of overcoming the inherent data scarsity due to the extremely small number of blood samples per patient. The relevance of our approach is illustrated with extensive numerical experiments that confirm the efficiency of the proposed pipeline.</description>

      <title>Feature Shift Localization Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources, noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The code and ready-to-use trained model are available at https://github.com/AI-sandbox/FSL-Net.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spatiotemporal Inference with Biased Scan Attention Transformer Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes. While early architectures were developed primarily as a scalable alternative to Gaussian Processes (GPs), modern NPs tackle far more complex and data hungry applications spanning geology, epidemiology, climate, and robotics. These applications have placed increasing pressure on the scalability of these models, with many architectures compromising accuracy for scalability. In this paper, we demonstrate that this tradeoff is often unnecessary, particularly when modeling fully or partially translation invariant processes. We propose a versatile new architecture, the Biased Scan Attention Transformer Neural Process (BSA-TNP), which introduces Kernel Regression Blocks (KRBlocks), group-invariant attention biases, and memory-efficient Biased Scan Attention (BSA). BSA-TNP is able to: (1) match or exceed the accuracy of the best models while often training in a fraction of the time, (2) exhibit translation invariance, enabling learning at multiple resolutions simultaneously, (3) transparently model processes that evolve in both space and time, (4) support high dimensional fixed effects, and (5) scale gracefully -- running inference with over 1M test points with 100K context points in under a minute on a single 24GB GPU.</description>

      <title>Integrated Analysis for Electronic Health Records with Structured and Sporadic Missingness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: We propose a novel imputation method tailored for Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with structured and sporadic missingness. Such missingness frequently arises in the integration of heterogeneous EHR datasets for downstream clinical applications. By addressing these gaps, our method provides a practical solution for integrated analysis, enhancing data utility and advancing the understanding of population health.
  Materials and Methods: We begin by demonstrating structured and sporadic missing mechanisms in the integrated analysis of EHR data. Following this, we introduce a novel imputation framework, Macomss, specifically designed to handle structurally and heterogeneously occurring missing data. We establish theoretical guarantees for Macomss, ensuring its robustness in preserving the integrity and reliability of integrated analyses. To assess its empirical performance, we conduct extensive simulation studies that replicate the complex missingness patterns observed in real-world EHR systems, complemented by validation using EHR datasets from the Duke University Health System (DUHS).
  Results: Simulation studies show that our approach consistently outperforms existing imputation methods. Using datasets from three hospitals within DUHS, Macomss achieves the lowest imputation errors for missing data in most cases and provides superior or comparable downstream prediction performance compared to benchmark methods.
  Conclusions: We provide a theoretically guaranteed and practically meaningful method for imputing structured and sporadic missing data, enabling accurate and reliable integrated analysis across multiple EHR datasets. The proposed approach holds significant potential for advancing research in population health.</description>

      <title>CFMI: Flow Matching for Missing Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range of data types and dimensionalities.</description>

      <title>G-Sim: Generative Simulations with Large Language Models and Gradient-Free Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing robust simulators is essential for asking "what if?" questions and guiding policy in critical domains like healthcare and logistics. However, existing methods often struggle, either failing to generalize beyond historical data or, when using Large Language Models (LLMs), suffering from inaccuracies and poor empirical alignment. We introduce G-Sim, a hybrid framework that automates simulator construction by synergizing LLM-driven structural design with rigorous empirical calibration. G-Sim employs an LLM in an iterative loop to propose and refine a simulator's core components and causal relationships, guided by domain knowledge. This structure is then grounded in reality by estimating its parameters using flexible calibration techniques. Specifically, G-Sim can leverage methods that are both likelihood-free and gradient-free with respect to the simulator, such as gradient-free optimization for direct parameter estimation or simulation-based inference for obtaining a posterior distribution over parameters. This allows it to handle non-differentiable and stochastic simulators. By integrating domain priors with empirical evidence, G-Sim produces reliable, causally-informed simulators, mitigating data-inefficiency and enabling robust system-level interventions for complex decision-making.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Surrogate Risk Bounds for Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work characterized when a minimizing sequence of an adversarial surrogate risk is also a minimizing sequence of the adversarial classification risk for binary classification -- a property known as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at which the adversarial classification risk converges to its optimal value for such a sequence of functions that minimize the adversarial surrogate. This paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate. Additionally, we derive distribution-dependent surrogate risk bounds in the standard (non-adversarial) learning setting, that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Simulation-trained conditional normalizing flows for likelihood approximation: a case study in stress regulation kinetics in yeast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired inference often hinges on the ability to construct a likelihood, or the probability of observing a sequence of data given a model. These likelihoods can be directly maximized for parameter estimation, incorporated into Bayesian frameworks, or even used as loss functions in neural networks. Yet, many models, despite being conceptually simple, lack tractable likelihoods. A notable example arises in estimating protein production from snapshot measurements of actively dividing cells. Here, the challenge stems from cell divisions occurring at non-Exponentially distributed intervals with each division stochastically partitioning protein content between daughter cells, making protein counts in any given cell a function of its full division history. Such history dependence precludes a straightforward likelihood based on a (standard Markovian) master equation. Instead, we employ conditional normalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn probability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods from simulated data. As a case study, we examine activation of the \emph{glc3} gene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under nutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot fluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects \emph{glc3} promoter activity. A na\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data ignoring cell division suggests many cells are active with low expression. However, fluorescent proteins persist and can be inherited, so cells may appear active from retaining ancestral fluorescence. Explicitly accounting for the (non-Markovian) effects of cell division reveals \emph{glc3} is mostly inactive under stress, showing that while cells occasionally activate it, expression is brief and transient.</description>

      <title>Safe Screening Rules for Group SLOPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable selection is a challenging problem in high-dimensional sparse learning, especially when group structures exist. Group SLOPE performs well for the adaptive selection of groups of predictors. However, the block non-separable group effects in Group SLOPE make existing methods either invalid or inefficient. Consequently, Group SLOPE tends to incur significant computational costs and memory usage in practical high-dimensional scenarios. To overcome this issue, we introduce a safe screening rule tailored for the Group SLOPE model, which efficiently identifies inactive groups with zero coefficients by addressing the block non-separable group effects. By excluding these inactive groups during training, we achieve considerable gains in computational efficiency and memory usage. Importantly, the proposed screening rule can be seamlessly integrated into existing solvers for both batch and stochastic algorithms. Theoretically, we establish that our screening rule can be safely employed with existing optimization algorithms, ensuring the same results as the original approaches. Experimental results confirm that our method effectively detects inactive feature groups and significantly boosts computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning: Randomized Exploration Meets Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions. To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.</description>

      <title>Knockoffs Inference under Privacy Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-X knockoff framework offers a model-free variable selection method that ensures finite sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. However, the complexity of generating knockoff variables, coupled with the model-free assumption, presents significant challenges for protecting data privacy in this context. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for knockoff inference within the differential privacy paradigm. Our proposed method guarantees robust privacy protection while preserving the exact FDR control entailed by the original model-X knockoff procedure. We further conduct power analysis and establish sufficient conditions under which the noise added for privacy preservation does not asymptotically compromise power. Through various applications, we demonstrate that the differential privacy knockoff (DP-knockoff) method can be effectively utilized to safeguard privacy during variable selection with FDR control in both low and high dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>On the Similarities of Embeddings in Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) operates on a simple yet effective principle: embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs are pushed apart. Although various forms of contrastive loss have been proposed and analyzed from different perspectives, prior works lack a comprehensive framework that systematically explains a broad class of these objectives. In this paper, we present a unified framework for understanding CL, which is based on analyzing the cosine similarity between embeddings of positive and negative pairs. In full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs is unattainable when similarities of negative pairs fall below a certain threshold, and that this misalignment can be alleviated by incorporating within-view negative pairs. In mini-batch settings, we demonstrate that smaller batch sizes incur stronger separation among negative pairs within batches, which leads to higher variance in similarities of negative pairs. To address this limitation of mini-batch CL, we introduce an auxiliary loss term that reduces the variance of similarities of negative pairs in CL. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating the proposed loss consistently improves the performance of CL methods in small-batch training.</description>

      <title>Private Aggregation for Byzantine-Resilient Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring resilience to Byzantine clients while maintaining the privacy of the clients' data is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL). When the clients' data is homogeneous, suitable countermeasures were studied from an information-theoretic perspective utilizing secure aggregation techniques while ensuring robust aggregation of the clients' gradients. However, the countermeasures used fail when the clients' data is heterogeneous. Suitable pre-processing techniques, such as nearest neighbor mixing, were recently shown to enhance the performance of those countermeasures in the heterogeneous setting. Nevertheless, those pre-processing techniques cannot be applied with the introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms.
  We propose a multi-stage method encompassing a careful co-design of verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private information retrieval scheme to achieve information-theoretic privacy guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme on a variety of attacks and show how it outperforms the previously known techniques. Since the communication overhead of secure aggregation is non-negligible, we investigate the interplay with zero-order estimation methods that reduce the communication cost in state-of-the-art FL tasks and thereby make private aggregation scalable.</description>

      <title>Learning single-index models via harmonic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning single-index models, where the label $y \in \mathbb{R}$ depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through an unknown one-dimensional projection $\langle \boldsymbol{w}_*,\boldsymbol{x}\rangle$. Prior work has shown that under Gaussian inputs, the statistical and computational complexity of recovering $\boldsymbol{w}_*$ is governed by the Hermite expansion of the link function. In this paper, we propose a new perspective: we argue that "spherical harmonics" -- rather than "Hermite polynomials" -- provide the natural basis for this problem, as they capture its intrinsic "rotational symmetry". Building on this insight, we characterize the complexity of learning single-index models under arbitrary spherically symmetric input distributions. We introduce two families of estimators -- based on tensor unfolding and online SGD -- that respectively achieve either optimal sample complexity or optimal runtime, and argue that estimators achieving both may not exist in general. When specialized to Gaussian inputs, our theory not only recovers and clarifies existing results but also reveals new phenomena that had previously been overlooked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used technique in recommendation systems. Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors, allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more accurate posterior estimates.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Online Strategic Decision Making with Information Asymmetry and Knowledge Transportability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems, especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards. These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d. actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.</description>

      <title>Almost-Optimal Local-Search Methods for Sparse Tensor PCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local-search methods are widely employed in statistical applications, yet interestingly, their theoretical foundations remain rather underexplored, compared to other classes of estimators such as low-degree polynomials and spectral methods. Of note, among the few existing results recent studies have revealed a significant "local-computational" gap in the context of a well-studied sparse tensor principal component analysis (PCA), where a broad class of local Markov chain methods exhibits a notable underperformance relative to other polynomial-time algorithms. In this work, we propose a series of local-search methods that provably "close" this gap to the best known polynomial-time procedures in multiple regimes of the model, including and going beyond the previously studied regimes in which the broad family of local Markov chain methods underperforms. Our framework includes: (1) standard greedy and randomized greedy algorithms applied to the (regularized) posterior of the model; and (2) novel random-threshold variants, in which the randomized greedy algorithm accepts a proposed transition if and only if the corresponding change in the Hamiltonian exceeds a random Gaussian threshold-rather that if and only if it is positive, as is customary. The introduction of the random thresholds enables a tight mathematical analysis of the randomized greedy algorithm's trajectory by crucially breaking the dependencies between the iterations, and could be of independent interest to the community.</description>

Abstract: Community detection is one of the most critical problems in modern network science. Its applications can be found in various fields, from protein modeling to social network analysis. Recently, many papers appeared studying the problem of overlapping community detection, where each node of a network may belong to several communities. In this work, we consider Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Model (MMSB) first proposed by Airoldi et al. MMSB provides quite a general setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The central question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities given an observed network. We compare different approaches and establish the minimax lower bound on the estimation error. Then, we propose a new estimator that matches this lower bound. Theoretical results are proved under fairly general conditions on the considered model. Finally, we illustrate the theory in a series of experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural likelihood estimation methods for simulation-based inference can suffer from performance degradation when the modeled data is very high-dimensional or lies along a lower-dimensional manifold, which is due to the inability of the density estimator to accurately estimate a density function. We present Surjective Sequential Neural Likelihood (SSNL) estimation, a novel member in the family of methods for simulation-based inference (SBI). SSNL fits a dimensionality-reducing surjective normalizing flow model and uses it as a surrogate likelihood function, which allows for computational inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo or variational Bayes methods. Among other benefits, SSNL avoids the requirement to manually craft summary statistics for inference of high-dimensional data sets, since the lower-dimensional representation is computed simultaneously with learning the likelihood and without additional computational overhead. We evaluate SSNL on a wide variety of experiments, including two challenging real-world examples from the astrophysics and neuroscience literatures, and show that it either outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art methods, making it an excellent off-the-shelf estimator for SBI for high-dimensional data sets.</description>

      <title>Adjusting Model Size in Continual Gaussian Processes: How Big is Big Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many machine learning models require setting a parameter that controls their size before training, e.g. number of neurons in DNNs, or inducing points in GPs. Increasing capacity typically improves performance until all the information from the dataset is captured. After this point, computational cost keeps increasing, without improved performance. This leads to the question "How big is big enough?" We investigate this problem for Gaussian processes (single-layer neural networks) in continual learning. Here, data becomes available incrementally, and the final dataset size will therefore not be known before training, preventing the use of heuristics for setting a fixed model size. We develop a method to automatically adjust model size while maintaining near-optimal performance. Our experimental procedure follows the constraint that any hyperparameters must be set without seeing dataset properties, and we show that our method performs well across diverse datasets without the need to adjust its hyperparameter, showing it requires less tuning than others.</description>

      <title>Temperature Optimization for Bayesian Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cold Posterior Effect (CPE) is a phenomenon in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), where tempering the posterior to a cold temperature often improves the predictive performance of the posterior predictive distribution (PPD). Although the term `CPE' suggests colder temperatures are inherently better, the BDL community increasingly recognizes that this is not always the case. Despite this, there remains no systematic method for finding the optimal temperature beyond grid search. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to select the temperature that maximizes test log-predictive density, treating the temperature as a model parameter and estimating it directly from the data. We empirically demonstrate that our method performs comparably to grid search, at a fraction of the cost, across both regression and classification tasks. Finally, we highlight the differing perspectives on CPE between the BDL and Generalized Bayes communities: while the former primarily emphasizes the predictive performance of the PPD, the latter prioritizes the utility of the posterior under model misspecification; these distinct objectives lead to different temperature preferences.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimality of deep neural networks on dependent data via PAC-Bayes bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a groundbreaking work, Schmidt-Hieber (2020) proved the minimax optimality of deep neural networks with ReLu activation for least-square regression estimation over a large class of functions defined by composition. In this paper, we extend these results in many directions. First, we remove the i.i.d. assumption on the observations, to allow some time dependence. The observations are assumed to be a Markov chain with a non-null pseudo-spectral gap. Then, we study a more general class of machine learning problems, which includes least-square and logistic regression as special cases. Leveraging on PAC-Bayes oracle inequalities and a version of Bernstein inequality due to Paulin (2015), we derive upper bounds on the estimation risk for a generalized Bayesian estimator. In the case of least-square regression, this bound matches (up to a logarithmic factor) the lower bound of Schmidt-Hieber (2020). We establish a similar lower bound for classification with the logistic loss, and prove that the proposed DNN estimator is optimal in the minimax sense.</description>

      <title>The Computational Advantage of Depth: Learning High-Dimensional Hierarchical Functions with Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the advantages of deep neural networks trained by gradient descent (GD) compared to shallow models remains an open theoretical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a class of target functions (single and multi-index Gaussian hierarchical targets) that incorporate a hierarchy of latent subspace dimensionalities. This framework enables us to analytically study the learning dynamics and generalization performance of deep networks compared to shallow ones in the high-dimensional limit. Specifically, our main theorem shows that feature learning with GD successively reduces the effective dimensionality, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a sequence of lower-dimensional ones. This enables learning the target function with drastically less samples than with shallow networks. While the results are proven in a controlled training setting, we also discuss more common training procedures and argue that they learn through the same mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training and transfer learning are commonly used techniques to initialize training algorithms for neural networks, particularly in settings with limited labeled data. In this paper, we study the effects of unsupervised pre-training and transfer learning on the sample complexity of high-dimensional supervised learning. Specifically, we consider the problem of training a single-layer neural network via online stochastic gradient descent. We establish that pre-training and transfer learning (under concept shift) reduce sample complexity by polynomial factors (in the dimension) under very general assumptions. We also uncover some surprising settings where pre-training grants exponential improvement over random initialization in terms of sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</description>

      <title>Multi-Variable Batch Bayesian Optimization in Materials Research: Synthetic Data Analysis of Noise Sensitivity and Problem Landscape Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) machine learning method is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks in materials science. To emulate the large number of input variables and noise-containing results in experimental materials research, we perform batch BO simulation of six design variables with a range of noise levels. Two test cases relevant for materials science problems are examined: a needle-in-a-haystack case (Ackley function) that may be encountered in, e.g., molecule optimizations, and a smooth landscape with a local optimum in addition to the global optimum (Hartmann function) that may be encountered in, e.g., material composition optimization. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the optimization progression and evaluate how the optimization outcomes are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function, and exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape: noise degrades the optimization results of a needle-in-a-haystack search (Ackley) dramatically more. However, with increasing noise, we observe an increasing probability of landing on the local optimum in Hartmann. Therefore, prior knowledge of the problem domain structure and noise level is essential when designing BO for materials research experiments. Synthetic data studies -- with known ground truth and controlled noise levels -- enable us to isolate and evaluate the impact of different batch BO components, {\it e.g.}, acquisition policy, objective metrics, and hyperparameter values, before transitioning to the inherent uncertainties of real experimental systems. The results and methodology of this study will facilitate a greater utilization of BO in guiding experimental materials research, specifically in settings with a large number of design variables to optimize.</description>

      <title>Generate-then-Verify: Reconstructing Data from Limited Published Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing tabular data from aggregate statistics, in which the attacker aims to identify interesting claims about the sensitive data that can be verified with 100% certainty given the aggregates. Successful attempts in prior work have conducted studies in settings where the set of published statistics is rich enough that entire datasets can be reconstructed with certainty. In our work, we instead focus on the regime where many possible datasets match the published statistics, making it impossible to reconstruct the entire private dataset perfectly (i.e., when approaches in prior work fail). We propose the problem of partial data reconstruction, in which the goal of the adversary is to instead output a $\textit{subset}$ of rows and/or columns that are $\textit{guaranteed to be correct}$. We introduce a novel integer programming approach that first $\textbf{generates}$ a set of claims and then $\textbf{verifies}$ whether each claim holds for all possible datasets consistent with the published aggregates. We evaluate our approach on the housing-level microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census release, demonstrating that privacy violations can still persist even when information published about such data is relatively sparse.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Estimation: Extending Gossip Algorithms to Ranking and Trimmed Means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17836v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized, relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank estimation and an $\mathcal{O}((\log t)/\sqrt{t})$ rate for trimmed mean estimation, where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data distributions and contamination schemes.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Teleconnection-Aware Transformer for Global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter temperature compared to previous best models.</description>

      <title>Effective Regularization Through Loss-Function Metalearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.00788v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation can be used to optimize several different aspects of neural network architectures. For instance, the TaylorGLO method discovers novel, customized loss functions, resulting in improved performance, faster training, and improved data utilization. A likely reason is that such functions discourage overfitting, leading to effective regularization. This paper demonstrates theoretically that this is indeed the case for TaylorGLO. Learning rule decomposition reveals that evolved loss functions balance two factors: the pull toward zero error, and a push away from it to avoid overfitting. This is a general principle that may be used to understand other regularization techniques as well (as demonstrated in this paper for label smoothing). The theoretical analysis leads to a constraint that can be utilized to find more effective loss functions in practice; the mechanism also results in networks that are more robust (as demonstrated in this paper with adversarial inputs). The analysis in this paper thus constitutes a first step towards understanding regularization, and demonstrates the power of evolutionary neural architecture search in general.</description>

      <title>Randomized Block-Coordinate Optimistic Gradient Algorithms for Root-Finding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03113v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop two new randomized block-coordinate optimistic gradient algorithms to approximate a solution of nonlinear equations in large-scale settings, which are called root-finding problems. Our first algorithm is non-accelerated with constant stepsizes, and achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ best-iterate convergence rate on $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert Gx^k\Vert^2]$ when the underlying operator $G$ is Lipschitz continuous and satisfies a weak Minty solution condition, where $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ is the expectation and $k$ is the iteration counter. Our second method is a new accelerated randomized block-coordinate optimistic gradient algorithm. We establish both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ last-iterate convergence rates on both $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert Gx^k\Vert^2]$ and $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert x^{k+1} - x^{k}\Vert^2]$ for this algorithm under the co-coerciveness of $G$. In addition, we prove that the iterate sequence $\{x^k\}$ converges to a solution almost surely, and $k\Vert Gx^k\Vert$ attains a $o(1/k)$ almost sure convergence rate. Then, we apply our methods to a class of large-scale finite-sum inclusions, which covers prominent applications in machine learning, statistical learning, and network optimization, especially in federated learning. We obtain two new federated learning-type algorithms and their convergence rate guarantees for solving this problem class.</description>

      <title>Feature Normalization Prevents Collapse of Non-contrastive Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework, where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al. (2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2 loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus, we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play image restoration with Stochastic deNOising REgularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms are a class of iterative algorithms that address image inverse problems by combining a physical model and a deep neural network for regularization. Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00397v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and constructing brain communications that capture dynamic communications across multiple regions is fundamental to modern system neuroscience, yet current methods struggle to find time-varying region-level communications or scale to large neural datasets with long recording durations. We present a novel framework using Markovian Gaussian Processes to learn brain communications with time-varying temporal delays from multi-region neural recordings, named Adaptive Delay Model (ADM). Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings datasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics of neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed neural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain networks.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Latent Bandits: Leveraging observational data for personalized decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16239v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many decision-making tasks, such as precision medicine, historical data alone are insufficient to determine the right choice for a new problem instance or patient. Online algorithms like multi-armed bandits can find optimal personalized decisions but are notoriously sample-hungry. In practice, training a bandit for a new individual from scratch is often infeasible, as the number of trials required is larger than the practical number of decision points. Latent bandits offer rapid exploration and personalization beyond what context variables can reveal, provided that a latent variable model can be learned consistently. In this work, we propose an identifiable latent bandit framework that leads to optimal decision-making with a shorter exploration time than classical bandits by learning from historical records of decisions and outcomes. Our method is based on nonlinear independent component analysis that provably identifies representations from observational data sufficient to infer the optimal action in new bandit instances. We verify this strategy in simulated and semi-synthetic environments, showing substantial improvement over online and offline learning baselines when identifying conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>The Causal Information Bottleneck and Optimal Causal Variable Abstractions</title>

Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct abstractions of parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.</description>

      <title>Amortized Inference of Causal Models via Conditional Fixed-Point Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural Causal Models (SCMs) offer a principled framework to reason about interventions and support out-of-distribution generalization, which are key goals in scientific discovery. However, the task of learning SCMs from observed data poses formidable challenges, and often requires training a separate model for each dataset. In this work, we propose amortized inference of SCMs by training a single model on multiple datasets sampled from different SCMs. We first use a transformer-based architecture for amortized learning of dataset embeddings, and then extend the Fixed-Point Approach (FiP) (Scetbon et al.) to infer SCMs conditionally on their dataset embeddings. As a byproduct, our method can generate observational and interventional data from novel SCMs at inference time, without updating parameters. Empirical results show that our amortized procedure performs on par with baselines trained specifically for each dataset on both in and out-of-distribution problems, and also outperforms them in scare data regimes.</description>

      <title>Unified Breakdown Analysis for Byzantine Robust Gossip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized machine learning, different devices communicate in a peer-to-peer manner to collaboratively learn from each other's data. Such approaches are vulnerable to misbehaving (or Byzantine) devices. We introduce F-RG, a general framework for building robust decentralized algorithms with guarantees arising from robust-sum-like aggregation rules F. We then investigate the notion of *breakdown point*, and show an upper bound on the number of adversaries that decentralized algorithms can tolerate. We introduce a practical robust aggregation rule, coined CS+, such that CS+-RG has a near-optimal breakdown. Other choices of aggregation rules lead to existing algorithms such as ClippedGossip or NNA. We give experimental evidence to validate the effectiveness of CS+-RG and highlight the gap with NNA, in particular against a novel attack tailored to decentralized communications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Equivalence of Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes: On the Importance of Learning Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a convenient framework for specifying function-space priors, making them a natural choice for modeling uncertainty. In contrast, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer greater scalability and extendability but lack the advantageous properties of GPs. This motivates the development of BNNs capable of replicating GP-like behavior. However, existing solutions are either limited to specific GP kernels or rely on heuristics.
  We demonstrate that trainable activations are crucial for effective mapping of GP priors to wide BNNs. Specifically, we leverage the closed-form 2-Wasserstein distance for efficient gradient-based optimization of reparameterized priors and activations. Beyond learned activations, we also introduce trainable periodic activations that ensure global stationarity by design, and functional priors conditioned on GP hyperparameters to allow efficient model selection.
  Empirically, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches or matches performance of the heuristic methods, while offering stronger theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>Community detection with the Bethe-Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Hessian matrix, introduced by Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014), is a Hermitian matrix designed for applying spectral clustering algorithms to sparse networks. Rather than employing a non-symmetric and high-dimensional non-backtracking operator, a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix is conjectured to also reach the Kesten-Stigum detection threshold in the sparse stochastic block model (SBM). We provide the first rigorous analysis of the Bethe-Hessian spectral method in the SBM under both the bounded expected degree and the growing degree regimes. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) When the expected degree $d\geq 2$, the number of negative outliers of the Bethe-Hessian matrix can consistently estimate the number of blocks above the Kesten-Stigum threshold, thus confirming a conjecture from Saade, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\'a (2014) for $d\geq 2$. (ii) For sufficiently large $d$, its eigenvectors can be used to achieve weak recovery. (iii) As $d\to\infty$, we establish the concentration of the locations of its negative outlier eigenvalues, and weak consistency can be achieved via a spectral method based on the Bethe-Hessian matrix.</description>

      <title>Network Dynamics-Based Framework for Understanding Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence call for a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying deep learning. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze learning dynamics through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We redefine the notions of linearity and nonlinearity in neural networks by introducing two fundamental transformation units at the neuron level: order-preserving transformations and non-order-preserving transformations. Different transformation modes lead to distinct collective behaviors in weight vector organization, different modes of information extraction, and the emergence of qualitatively different learning phases. Transitions between these phases may occur during training, accounting for key phenomena such as grokking. To further characterize generalization and structural stability, we introduce the concept of attraction basins in both sample and weight spaces. The distribution of neurons with different transformation modes across layers, along with the structural characteristics of the two types of attraction basins, forms a set of core metrics for analyzing the performance of learning models. Hyperparameters such as depth, width, learning rate, and batch size act as control variables for fine-tuning these metrics. Our framework not only sheds light on the intrinsic advantages of deep learning, but also provides a novel perspective for optimizing network architectures and training strategies.</description>

      <title>Bias Detection via Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bias evaluation is fundamental to trustworthy AI, both in terms of checking data quality and in terms of checking the outputs of AI systems. In testing data quality, for example, one may study the distance of a given dataset, viewed as a distribution, to a given ground-truth reference dataset. However, classical metrics, such as the Total Variation and the Wasserstein distances, are known to have high sample complexities and, therefore, may fail to provide a meaningful distinction in many practical scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a new notion of distance, the Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy (MSD). In this metric, two distributions are close if, roughly, discrepancies are low for all feature subgroups. While the number of subgroups may be exponential, we show that the sample complexity is linear in the number of features, thus making it feasible for practical applications. Moreover, we provide a practical algorithm for evaluating the distance based on Mixed-integer optimization (MIO). We also note that the proposed distance is easily interpretable, thus providing clearer paths to fixing the biases once they have been identified. Finally, we describe a natural general bias detection framework, termed MSDD distances, and show that MSD aligns well with this framework. We empirically evaluate MSD by comparing it with other metrics and by demonstrating the above properties of MSD on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies are Virtue: Weak-to-Strong Generalization through Lens of Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student-weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Our analysis further casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported by experiments on synthetic regression problems, as well as real vision and NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction as Bayesian Quadrature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning-based prediction systems are increasingly used in high-stakes situations, it is important to understand how such predictive models will perform upon deployment. Distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques such as conformal prediction provide guarantees about the loss black-box models will incur even when the details of the models are hidden. However, such methods are based on frequentist probability, which unduly limits their applicability. We revisit the central aspects of conformal prediction from a Bayesian perspective and thereby illuminate the shortcomings of frequentist guarantees. We propose a practical alternative based on Bayesian quadrature that provides interpretable guarantees and offers a richer representation of the likely range of losses to be observed at test time.</description>

      <title>RNE: a plug-and-play framework for diffusion density estimation and inference-time control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE), a flexible, plug-and-play framework for diffusion inference-time density estimation and control, based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions. RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective, stemming from basic variational inference and probabilistic principles therefore offering both theoretical clarity and practical versatility. Experiments demonstrate that RNE delivers strong results in diffusion density estimation, and offers broad applicability to inference-time control tasks -- such as annealing, diffusion model composition, and reward-tilting -- with promising inference-time scaling performance.</description>

      <title>Certified Unlearning for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning, where the goal is to remove the influence of specific training data from a model upon request, motivated by privacy concerns and regulatory requirements such as the "right to be forgotten." Unfortunately, existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or lack formal guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel method for certified machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between unlearning and privacy amplification by stochastic post-processing. Our method uses noisy fine-tuning on the retain data, i.e., data that does not need to be removed, to ensure provable unlearning guarantees. This approach requires no assumptions about the underlying loss function, making it broadly applicable across diverse settings. We analyze the theoretical trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy and demonstrate empirically that our method not only achieves formal unlearning guarantees but also performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing baselines.

      <title>Modified K-means Algorithm with Local Optimality Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The K-means algorithm is one of the most widely studied clustering algorithms in machine learning. While extensive research has focused on its ability to achieve a globally optimal solution, there still lacks a rigorous analysis of its local optimality guarantees. In this paper, we first present conditions under which the K-means algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution. Based on this, we propose simple modifications to the K-means algorithm which ensure local optimality in both the continuous and discrete sense, with the same computational complexity as the original K-means algorithm. As the dissimilarity measure, we consider a general Bregman divergence, which is an extension of the squared Euclidean distance often used in the K-means algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm does not always find a locally optimal solution in practice, while our proposed methods provide improved locally optimal solutions with reduced clustering loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/lmingyi/LO-K-means.</description>

      <title>Pointwise confidence estimation in the non-linear $\ell^2$-regularized least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a high-probability non-asymptotic confidence estimation in the $\ell^2$-regularized non-linear least-squares setting with fixed design. In particular, we study confidence estimation for local minimizers of the regularized training loss. We show a pointwise confidence bound, meaning that it holds for the prediction on any given fixed test input $x$. Importantly, the proposed confidence bound scales with similarity of the test input to the training data in the implicit feature space of the predictor (for instance, becoming very large when the test input lies far outside of the training data). This desirable last feature is captured by the weighted norm involving the inverse-Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a generalized version of its counterpart in the linear setting, $x^{\top} \text{Cov}^{-1} x$. Our generalized result can be regarded as a non-asymptotic counterpart of the classical confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the MLE estimator. We propose an efficient method for computing the weighted norm, which only mildly exceeds the cost of a gradient computation of the loss function. Finally, we complement our analysis with empirical evidence showing that the proposed confidence bound provides better coverage/width trade-off compared to a confidence estimation by bootstrapping, which is a gold-standard method in many applications involving non-linear predictors such as neural networks.</description>
