      <title>Risk Sharing Among Many: Implementing a Subgame Perfect and Optimal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether an ex-ante welfare-maximising risk allocation rule can be implemented among many participants. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of the price and choose mechanism proposed by Echenique and N\'u\~nez(2025) to risk allocation problems. While their mechanism implements Pareto optimal allocations in finite choice sets, we consider extending it to an infinite choice set of feasible risk-sharing allocations. This paper asks whether an ex-ante welfare-maximising risk allocation rule can indeed be implemented for a large group. Specifically, we study the price and choose (P&amp;C) mechanism of Echenique and N\'u\~nez(2025) in a risk-sharing setting. In P&amp;C, players sequentially set prices for each possible alternative; the last player chooses an alternative, provided that all previous players receive the prices they set. Echenique and N\'u\~nez(2025) show that, for finite choice sets, the mechanism implements any Pareto optimal allocation in the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. Our setting differs in one crucial respect: the choice set is infinite. Each alternative is a feasible allocation of total risk, and each player sets a Lipschitz-continuous price function on this infinite set. We show that the P&amp;C mechanism can still be extended to implement the allocation that maximises the sum of players' utilities, even with an infinite choice set.</description>

      <title>Delegation and Participation in Decentralized Governance: An Epistemic View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and apply epistemic tests to various decentralized governance methods as well as to study the impact of participation. These tests probe the ability to reach a correct outcome when there is one. We find that partial abstention is a strong governance method from an epistemic standpoint compared to alternatives such as various forms of ``transfer delegation" in which voters explicitly transfer some or all of their voting rights to others. We make a stronger case for multi-step transfer delegation than is present in previous work but also demonstrate that transfer delegation has inherent epistemic weaknesses. We show that enhanced direct participation, voters exercising their own voting rights, can have a variety of epistemic impacts, some very negative. We identify governance conditions under which additional direct participation is guaranteed to do no epistemic harm and is likely to increase the probability of making correct decisions. In light of the epistemic challenges of voting-based decentralized governance, we consider the possible supplementary use of prediction markets, auctions, and AI agents to improve outcomes. All these results are significant because epistemic performance matters if entities such as DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) wish to compete with organizations that are more centralized.</description>

      <title>Compatibility between Stability and Strategy-Proofness: A Single-Peaked Preferences Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-sided matching markets, ensuring both stability and strategy-proofness poses a significant challenge; it is impossible when agents' preferences are unrestricted. But what if agents' preferences have specific restricted structures? Such scenarios frequently arise in real-world applications. This study explores the possibility of achieving both stability and strategy-proofness by focusing on scenarios where agents' preferences follow a structured pattern called single-peakedness.
  We focus on the simplest case - the well-known marriage problem, which is a one-to-one matching market. Despite its simplicity, this model is a useful starting point for exploration in many cases. Our main contribution is identifying all single-peaked subdomains on which stability and (weak/strong group) strategy-proofness are compatible, which we present through two key results. The first one characterizes all single-peaked subdomains with stable and (weakly group) strategy-proof matching rules, and identifies such a matching rule on these domains. The second one is an impossibility result that shows the incompatibility between stability and strong group strategy-proofness on single-peaked subdomains.</description>

      <title>On the Oscillations in Cournot Games with Best Response Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model, which involves multiple firms producing homogeneous products. To explore the oscillation under the updates of best response strategies, we focus on the linear price functions. In this setting, we establish the existence of oscillations. In particular, we show that for the scenario of different costs among firms, the best response converges to either a unique equilibrium or a two-period oscillation. We further characterize the oscillations and propose linear-time algorithms for finding all types of two-period oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first step toward fully analyzing the periodic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model.</description>

      <title>Collective decisions under uncertainty: efficiency, ex-ante fairness, and normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies preference aggregation under uncertainty in the multi-profile framework introduced by Sprumont (2018, 2019) and characterizes a new class of aggregation rules that can address classical concerns about Harsanyi's (1955) utilitarian rules. Our class of aggregation rules, which we call relative fair aggregation rules, is grounded in three key ideas: utilitarianism, egalitarianism, and the 0--1 normalization. These rules are parameterized by a set of weights over individuals. Each ambiguous alternative is evaluated by computing the minimum weighted sum of the 0--1 normalized utility levels within that weight set. For the characterization, we propose two novel key axioms -- weak preference for mixing and restricted certainty independence -- developed using a new method of objectively randomizing outcomes even within the fully uncertain Savagean framework. Furthermore, we show that relative utilitarian aggregation rules can be identified from the above class by imposing an axiom stronger than restricted certainty independence, and that the Rawlsian maximin version can be derived by considering strong preference for mixing instead.</description>
