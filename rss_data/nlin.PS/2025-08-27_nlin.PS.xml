      <title>Evolution of extreme nonlinear wave fields over strongly reflective plane beaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of complex wave processes, in addition to the shoaling problem, is often cumbersome even for the evolution of regular waves. For reflection under the regime of wave breaking, the surf similarity is generally accepted as the leading parameter controlling the reflection rates and types of breakers. Although little is known about the effect of reflection rates on the formation of extreme nonlinear waves, some debate has arisen regarding whether high reflection rates enhance the nonlinearity at the tail of the wave height distribution. In this work, we provide theoretical evidence that at very steep beaches of smooth composition, the reflection rate near unity will tend to stabilize the excess kurtosis otherwise generated by shoaling and controlled in magnitude by the bottom slope magnitude. We further verified this result through fully nonlinear numerical simulations, reaching a good agreement.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operator describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>

      <title>Resonant Interactions of Poincare Waves in the Shallow Water Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper develops a weakly nonlinear theory of Poincare waves. The nondegeneracy of the Poincare wave dispersion law leads to the presence of resonant interactions in perturbation theory. A study of the dispersion relation of Poincare waves showed that three-wave interactions are absent in the quadratic nonlinear approximation. In this paper, a linear equation of the envelope is derived. A qualitative study of the dispersion law showed the existence of four-wave interactions of Poincare waves. Equations of nonlinear interactions of four waves for the amplitudes of Poincare waves are derived. The Manley-Rowe equations are obtained, which determine the distribution of energy and its transfer between interacting waves. The nonlinear dynamics of interacting waves is investigated. The saturation effect of Poincare waves, which is important for geophysical hydrodynamics, has been predicted. An analytical solution is obtained that describes the saturation effect of Poincare waves in time.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear oscillations of strings and beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time-periodic solutions to the nonlinear wave and beam equations and uncover their intricate, fractal-like structure. In particular, we identify a new class of large-energy solutions with complex mode compositions and propose a systematic framework for their analysis. A Floquet stability study reveals that this class contains solutions that are linearly stable, suggesting that they may play a significant role in the nonlinear dynamics of the systems.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave formation in the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of perturbations in a compressible one-dimensional inviscid gas with an ambient state consisting of constant pressure and periodically-varying density. We show through asymptotic analysis that long-wavelength perturbations approximately obey a system of dispersive nonlinear wave equations. Computational experiments demonstrate that solutions of the 1D Euler equations agree well with this dispersive model, with solutions consisting mainly of solitary waves. Shock formation seems to be avoided for moderate-amplitude initial data, while shock formation occurs for larger initial data. We investigate the threshold for transition between these behaviors, validating a previously-proposed criterion based on further computational experiments. These results support the existence of large-time non-breaking solutions to the 1D compressible Euler equations, as hypothesized in previous works.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Flow Past an Obstacle in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supersonic flow past an obstacle can generate a rich variety of wave excitations. This paper investigates, both analytically and numerically, two types of excitations generated by the flow of a Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluid past an obstacle: linear radiation and oblique dark solitons. We show that wave crests of linear radiation can be accurately described by the proper modification of the Kelvin original theory, while the oblique dark soliton solution is obtained analytically by transformation of the 1D soliton solution to the obstacle's reference frame. A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrates good agreement, validating our theoretical approach.</description>
