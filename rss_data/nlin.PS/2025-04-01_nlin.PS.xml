      <title>Integral Asymptotics, Coalescing Saddles, and Multiple-scales Analysis of a Generalised Swift-Hohenberg Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral asymptotics play an important role in the analysis of differential equations and in a variety of other settings. In this work, we apply an integral asymptotics approach to study spatially localized solutions of a heterogeneous generalised Swift-Hohenberg equation. The outer solution is obtained via WKBJ asymptotics, while the inner solution requires the method of coalescing saddles. We modify the classic method of Chester et al. to account for additional technicalities, such as complex branch selection and local transformation to a cubic polynomial. By integrating our results, we construct an approximate global solution to the generalised Swift-Hohenberg problem and validate it against numerical contour integral solutions. We also demonstrate an alternative approach that circumvents the complexity of integral asymptotics by analyzing the original differential equation directly through a multiple-scales analysis and show that this generates the same leading-order inner solution obtained using the coalescing saddles method at least for one of the cases considered via integral asymptotics. Our findings reinforce the significance of integral asymptotics in approximating the fourth order differential equations found in the linear stability analysis for generalisations of the Swift Hohenberg equations. This study has also highlighted a conjecture that, in certain cases, the method of coalescing saddles can be systematically replaced by multiple-scales analysis using an intermediary differential equation, a hypothesis for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Gradient catastrophe and Peregrine soliton in nonlinear flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the generation of extreme wave events in mechanical metamaterials using the regularization of the gradient catastrophe theory developed by A. Tovbis and M. Bertola for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. According to this theory, Peregrine solitons can locally emerge in the semiclassical limit of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Our objective is to determine whether the phenomenon of gradient catastrophe can occur in a class of architected structures designated as flexible mechanical metamaterials, both with and without losses. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that this phenomenon can occur in a canonical example of such flexible mechanical metamaterial, a chain of rotating units, studied earlier for its ability to support robust nonlinear waves such as elastic vector solitons. We find that in the presence of weak losses, the gradient catastrophe persists although the amplitude of extreme generated events is smaller and their onset is delayed compared to the lossless configuration.</description>

      <title>Breaking a superfluid harmonic dam: Observation and theory of rarefaction flow, Riemann invariants and sonic horizon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates are a prime testbed for the study of superfluid hydrodynamics. In a channel geometry, these systems are known to host prototypical hydrodynamic effects such as shocks, rarefaction waves and solitons, forming a bridge between classical and quantum dynamics. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the dry-bed dam-break problem in a channel geometry, a hallmark problem of nonlinear dynamics. Our setup extends the canonical setting by adding harmonic confinement, or an effective bathymetry, along the channel, further enhancing the richness of dynamics. We obtain an analytical solution of the 1D Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation for the harmonic dam-break problem that provides further insight. Experimentally, we characterize the flow by measuring its Riemann invariant coordinates and find good agreement with computations of the 3D GP equation as well as with the analytical solution. Our experimental observation of a sonic horizon, and the prediction of collisions between such horizons at longer times, offer an intriguing perspective for further studies.</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, the demonstrated structures are relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the previously unknown coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of top-down nanofabrication techniques.</description>

      <title>Control of the magnetic hopfion lattice in helimagnet with the external field and anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized micromagnetic model of hopfions in a helimagnet with a two-dimensional (allowing both radial and azimuthal dependence) profile function is considered. Calculations confirm the elliptical stability of hopfions and the previously obtained analytical expression for the upper critical field of their lattice. Dependencies of the hopfion lattice periods on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field and the uniaxial anisotropy constant of the material are obtained. It is shown that in an anisotropic helimagnet, the hopfion lattice has a layered (graphite-like) layout, which can be controlled by the external field and the uniaxial anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Buckling and post-buckling of cylindrical shells under combined torsional and axial loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The buckling behavior of cylindrical shells has gained significant interest over the past century due to its rich nonlinear behavior and broad engineering applications. While the buckling of cylindrical shells under a single load (e.g., compression or torsion) has been extensively studied, the buckling behavior under combined torsional and axial loads remains largely unexplored. In this paper, based on a combination of experiments, theoretical modeling, and finite element simulations, we systematically investigate the buckling and post-buckling behavior of cylindrical shells under combined torsional and axial loads. Three different types of combined loads are considered: compression with pre-torsion, torsion with pre-tension, and torsion with pre-compression. The theoretical model is established within the framework of the Donnell shell theory and solved using the Galerkin method, through which the critical buckling load, critical circumferential wavenumber, buckling pattern, and post-buckling equilibrium path of clamped-clamped thin cylindrical shells under various types of loads can be determined. The theoretical predictions agree well with finite element simulations and qualitatively capture the various buckling phenomena observed in the experiments. It is found that cylindrical shells exhibit quite different post-buckling behavior under combined loads compared to under a single compressive or torsional load. For instance, when a clamped-clamped thin cylindrical shell is subjected to pure torsion or torsion with a relatively small pre-compression, it consistently shows a diagonal-shaped pattern during deformation. However, with a relatively large pre-compression, the shell transitions from a diagonal-shaped pattern to a twisted diamond-shaped pattern.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions and data-driven discovery of higher-order Burgers' hierarchy equations with physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) with progressively higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms. Notable members of this hierarchy are the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are widely applied in fields such as plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions to these equations have been identified and the fission and fusion of solitons have been studied using analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as a new approach for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored in this context. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law, specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy, to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy, their robustness to increased levels of data noise, and their limited yet measurable predictive capabilities. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the discovery of the PDE model that describes the observed solitary structures.</description>
