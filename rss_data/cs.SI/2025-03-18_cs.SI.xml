      <title>Join the Chat: How Curiosity Sparks Participation in Telegram Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the mechanisms that spark user curiosity driving active engagement within public Telegram groups. By analyzing approximately 6 million messages from 29,196 users across 409 groups, we identify and quantify the key factors that stimulate users to actively participate (i.e., send messages) in group discussions. These factors include social influence, novelty, complexity, uncertainty, and conflict, all measured through metrics derived from message sequences and user participation over time. After clustering the messages, we apply explainability techniques to assign meaningful labels to the clusters. This approach uncovers macro categories representing distinct curiosity stimulation profiles, each characterized by a unique combination of various stimuli. Social influence from peers and influencers drives engagement for some users, while for others, rare media types or a diverse range of senders and media sparks curiosity. Analyzing patterns, we found that user curiosity stimuli are mostly stable, but, as the time between the initial message increases, curiosity occasionally shifts. A graph-based analysis of influence networks reveals that users motivated by direct social influence tend to occupy more peripheral positions, while those who are not stimulated by any specific factors are often more central, potentially acting as initiators and conversation catalysts. These findings contribute to understanding information dissemination and spread processes on social media networks, potentially contributing to more effective communication strategies.</description>

      <title>CARDS: A collection of package, revision, and miscellaneous dependency graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CARDS (Corpus of Acyclic Repositories and Dependency Systems) is a collection of directed graphs which express dependency relations, extracted from diverse real-world sources such as package managers, version control systems, and event graphs. Each graph contains anywhere from thousands to hundreds of millions of nodes and edges, which are normalized into a simple, unified format. Both cyclic and acyclic variants are included (as some graphs, such as citation networks, are not entirely acyclic). The dataset is suitable for studying the structure of different kinds of dependencies, enabling the characterization and distinction of various dependency graph types. It has been utilized for developing and testing efficient algorithms which leverage the specificities of source version control graphs. The collection is publicly available at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14245890.</description>

      <title>Evidence of social learning across symbolic cultural barriers in sperm whales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05304v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide quantitative evidence suggesting social learning in sperm whales across socio-cultural boundaries, using acoustic data from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Traditionally, sperm whale populations are categorized into clans based on their vocal repertoire: the rhythmically patterned click sequences (codas) that they use. Among these codas, identity codas function as symbolic markers for each clan, accounting for 35-60% of codas they produce. We introduce a computational method to model whale speech, which encodes rhythmic micro-variations within codas, capturing their vocal style. We find that vocal style-clans closely align with repertoire-clans. However, contrary to vocal repertoire, we show that sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, i.e. most codas, suggesting social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, this subcoda structure model offers a framework for comparing communication systems in other species, with potential implications for deeper understanding of vocal and cultural transmission within animal societies.</description>

      <title>Can I introduce my boyfriend to my grandmother? Evaluating Large Language Models Capabilities on Iranian Social Norm Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating globally inclusive AI systems demands datasets reflecting diverse social norms. Iran, with its unique cultural blend, offers an ideal case study, with Farsi adding linguistic complexity. In this work, we introduce the Iranian Social Norms (ISN) dataset, a novel collection of 1,699 Iranian social norms, including environments, demographic features, and scope annotation, alongside English translations. Our evaluation of 6 Large Language Models (LLMs) in classifying Iranian social norms, using a variety of prompts, uncovered critical insights into the impact of geographic and linguistic context. Results revealed a substantial performance gap in LLMs' comprehension of Iranian norms. Notably, while the geographic context in English prompts enhanced the performance, this effect was absent in Farsi, pointing to nuanced linguistic challenges. Particularly, performance was significantly worse for Iran-specific norms, emphasizing the importance of culturally tailored datasets. As the first Farsi dataset for social norm classification, ISN will facilitate crucial cross-cultural analyses, shedding light on how values differ across contexts and cultures.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Neural Networks through the Lens of Message Passing: A Common Perspective to Homophily and Architecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the current hypergraph learning methodologies and benchmarking datasets in the hypergraph realm are obtained by lifting procedures from their graph analogs, leading to overshadowing specific characteristics of hypergraphs. This paper attempts to confront some pending questions in that regard: Q1 Can the concept of homophily play a crucial role in Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs)? Q2 Is there room for improving current HNN architectures by carefully addressing specific characteristics of higher-order networks? Q3 Do existing datasets provide a meaningful benchmark for HNNs? To address them, we first introduce a novel conceptualization of homophily in higher-order networks based on a Message Passing (MP) scheme, unifying both the analytical examination and the modeling of higher-order networks. Further, we investigate some natural, yet mostly unexplored, strategies for processing higher-order structures within HNNs such as keeping hyperedge-dependent node representations, or performing node/hyperedge stochastic samplings, leading us to the most general MP formulation up to date -MultiSet-, as well as to an original architecture design, MultiSetMixer. Finally, we conduct an extensive set of experiments that contextualize our proposals and successfully provide insights about our inquiries.</description>

      <title>Scam Detection for Ethereum Smart Contracts: Leveraging Graph Representation Learning for Secure Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the increasing abuse of fraudulent activities that result in significant financial and reputational harm, Ethereum smart contracts face a significant problem in detecting fraud. Existing monitoring methods typically rely on lease code analysis or physically extracted features, which suffer from scalability and adaptability limitations. In this study, we use graph representation learning to observe purchase trends and find fraudulent deals. We can achieve powerful categorisation performance by using innovative machine learning versions and transforming Ethereum invoice data into graph structures. Our method addresses label imbalance through SMOTE-ENN techniques and evaluates models like Multi-Layer Perceptron ( MLP ) and Graph Convolutional Networks ( GCN). Experimental results show that the MLP type surpasses the GCN in this environment, with domain-specific assessments closely aligned with real-world assessments. This study provides a scalable and efficient way to improve Ethereum's ecosystem's confidence and security.</description>
