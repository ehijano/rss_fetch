      <title>Generating long-horizon stock "buy" signals with a neural language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes experiments on fine-tuning a small language model to generate forecasts of long-horizon stock price movements. Inputs to the model are narrative text from 10-K reports of large market capitalization companies in the S&amp;P 500 index; the output is a forward-looking buy or sell decision. Price direction is predicted at discrete horizons up to 12 months after the report filing date. The results reported here demonstrate good out-of-sample statistical performance (F1-macro= 0.62) at medium to long investment horizons. In particular, the buy signals generated from 10-K text are found most precise at 6 and 9 months in the future. As measured by the F1 score, the buy signal provides between 4.8 and 9 percent improvement against a random stock selection model. In contrast, sell signals generated by the models do not perform well. This may be attributed to the highly imbalanced out-of-sample data, or perhaps due to management drafting annual reports with a bias toward positive language. Cross-sectional analysis of performance by economic sector suggests that idiosyncratic reporting styles within industries are correlated with varying degrees and time scales of price movement predictability.</description>

      <title>A Stock Price Prediction Approach Based on Time Series Decomposition and Multi-Scale CNN using OHLCT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock price fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, government policies, and market sentiment, which together make price movements complex and difficult to predict. Despite many studies aimed at enhancing stock price prediction models, challenges such as data noise, model overfitting, and lack of interpretability are still encountered. To address these issues and improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a novel method, named Sequence-based Multiscale Fusion Regression Convolutional Neural Network (SMSFR-CNN), for predicting stock price movements in the China A-share market. By utilizing CNN to learn sequential features and combining them with image features, we improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction on the A-share market stock dataset. This approach reduces the search space for image features, stabilizes, and accelerates the training process. Extensive comparative experiments on 4,454 A-share stocks show that the proposed model achieves 61.15% for positive predictive value and 63.37% for negative predictive value of the stock price trend over the next 5 days, resulting in a total profit of 165.09%.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and NLP in Cryptocurrency Forecasting: Integrating Financial, Blockchain, and Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce novel approaches to cryptocurrency price forecasting, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. By analysing news and social media content, primarily from Twitter and Reddit, we assess the impact of public sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. A distinctive feature of our methodology is the application of the BART MNLI zero-shot classification model to detect bullish and bearish trends, significantly advancing beyond traditional sentiment analysis. Additionally, we systematically compare a range of pre-trained and fine-tuned deep learning NLP models against conventional dictionary-based sentiment analysis methods. Another key contribution of our work is the adoption of local extrema alongside daily price movements as predictive targets, reducing trading frequency and portfolio volatility. Our findings demonstrate that integrating textual data into cryptocurrency price forecasting not only improves forecasting accuracy but also consistently enhances the profitability and Sharpe ratio across various validation scenarios, particularly when applying deep learning NLP techniques. The entire codebase of our experiments is made available via an online repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/crypto-forecasting-public</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. The time evolution of the surface area is shown to follow a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow until the cosmological constant stops their growth. Two different equilibrium states are distinguished, dominated by (i) planar surfaces, and (ii) ``foamy'' surfaces, whose genus diverges. Time variations of the order parameter are analyzed and are found to have generalized hyperbolic distributions. In state (i), those have power law tails with a tail index close to 4. Analogies between the time evolution of the order parameter and a multifractal random walk are also pointed out.</description>
