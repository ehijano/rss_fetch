      <title>Tokenization of Real Estate Assets Using Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology is one of the key technologies that have revolutionized various facets of society, such as the banking, healthcare, and other critical ecosystems. One area that can harness the usage of blockchain is the real estate sector. The most lucrative long-term investment is real estate, followed by gold, equities, mutual funds, and savings accounts. Nevertheless, it has administrative overheads such as lack of transparency, fraud, several intermediaries, title issues, paperwork, an increasing number of arbitrations, and the lack of liquidity. This paper proposes a framework that uses blockchain as an underlying technology. With the aid of blockchain and the suite of tools, it supports many of these problems that can be alleviated in the real estate investment ecosystem. These include smart contracts, immutable record management, tokenization, record tracking, and time-stamped storage. Tokenization of real estate lowers the entry barrier by fixing liquidity and interoperability and improving the interaction between various stakeholders.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Design and Realization of Alternative Superconducting Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum hardware architectures have been designed by considering the physical constraints of the underlying physics. These general-purpose architectures leave room for customization and optimization that can be exploited with alternative architectures specific to the quantum applications that will be executed on the quantum hardware. However, the corresponding design steps are hardly integrated yet and still rely heavily on manual labor. In this work, we provide a software framework that aims at providing a foundation to address this drawback. To this end, we first review the design of superconducting quantum hardware architectures and, afterwards, propose a cohesive framework encapsulating the design flow of an application-specific quantum hardware architecture. The resulting framework integrates high-level architecture generation optimized for a quantum application, the physical layout of the architecture, as well as optimization of the layout in a methodical manner. The framework with a reference implementation is available via https://github.com/cda-tum/dasqa under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>LLMChain: Blockchain-based Reputation System for Sharing and Evaluating Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid growth in emerging challenges and capabilities of language understanding, generation, and reasoning. Despite their remarkable performance in natural language processing-based applications, LLMs are susceptible to undesirable and erratic behaviors, including hallucinations, unreliable reasoning, and the generation of harmful content. These flawed behaviors undermine trust in LLMs and pose significant hurdles to their adoption in real-world applications, such as legal assistance and medical diagnosis, where precision, reliability, and ethical considerations are paramount. These could also lead to user dissatisfaction, which is currently inadequately assessed and captured. Therefore, to effectively and transparently assess users' satisfaction and trust in their interactions with LLMs, we design and develop LLMChain, a decentralized blockchain-based reputation system that combines automatic evaluation with human feedback to assign contextual reputation scores that accurately reflect LLM's behavior. LLMChain not only helps users and entities identify the most trustworthy LLM for their specific needs, but also provides LLM developers with valuable information to refine and improve their models. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a blockchain-based distributed framework for sharing and evaluating LLMs has been introduced. Implemented using emerging tools, LLMChain is evaluated across two benchmark datasets, showcasing its effectiveness and scalability in assessing seven different LLMs.</description>
