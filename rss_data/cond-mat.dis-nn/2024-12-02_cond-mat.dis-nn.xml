      <title>Machine learning the Ising transition: A comparison between discriminative and generative approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of phase transitions is a central task in many-body physics. To automate this process, the task can be phrased as a classification problem. Classification problems can be approached in two fundamentally distinct ways: through either a discriminative or a generative method. In general, it is unclear which of these two approaches is most suitable for a given problem. The choice is expected to depend on factors such as the availability of system knowledge, dataset size, desired accuracy, computational resources, and other considerations. In this work, we answer the question of how one should approach the solution of phase-classification problems by performing a numerical case study on the thermal phase transition in the classical two-dimensional square-lattice ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi complexity in mean-field disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configurational entropy, or complexity, plays a critical role in characterizing disordered systems such as glasses, yet its measurement often requires significant computational resources. Recently, R\'enyi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, has gained attention across various fields of physics due to its simpler functional form, making it more practical for measurements. In this paper, we compute the R\'enyi version of complexity for prototypical mean-field disordered models, including the random energy model, its generalization, referred to as the random free energy model, and the $p$-spin spherical model. We first demonstrate that the R\'enyi complexity with index $m$ is related to the free energy difference for a generalized annealed Franz-Parisi potential with $m$ clones. Detailed calculations show that for models having one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), the R\'enyi complexity vanishes at the Kauzmann transition temperature $T_K$, irrespective of $m&gt;1$, while RSB solutions are required even in the liquid phase. This study strengthens the link between R\'enyi entropy and the physics of disordered systems and provides theoretical insights for its practical measurements.</description>

      <title>Planckian Diffusion: The Ghost of Anderson Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that Anderson localization ceases to exist when a random medium begins to move, but another type of fundamental quantum effect, Planckian diffusion $D = \alpha\hbar/m$, rises to replace it, with $\alpha $ of order of unity. Planckian diffusion supercedes the Planckian speed limit $\tau= \alpha \hbar/k_B T,$ as it not only implies this relation in thermal systems but also applies more generally without requiring thermal equilibrium. Here we model a dynamic disordered system with thousands of itinerant impurities, having random initial positions and velocities. By incrementally increasing their speed from zero, we observe a transition from Anderson localization to Planckian diffusion, with $\alpha$ falling within the range of $0.5$ to $2$. Furthermore, we relate the breakdown of Anderson localization to three additional, distinctly different confirming cases that also exhibit Planckian diffusion $D\sim \hbar/m$, including one experiment on solid hydrogen. Our finding suggests that Planckian diffusion in dynamic disordered systems is as universal as Anderson localization in static disordered systems, which may shed light on quantum transport studies.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an analytic approach for the steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on locally tree-like graphs. It is based on the definition of a probability distribution for infinite edge trajectories in terms of infinite matrix products. For homogeneous ensembles on regular graphs, the distribution is parametrized by a single $d\times d\times r^2$ tensor, where $r$ is the number of states per variable and $d$ is the matrix-product bond dimension. While the approach becomes exact in the large-$d$ limit, it usually produces extremely accurate results even for small $d$. The $d^2r^2$ parameters are found by solving a fixed point equation, for which we provide an efficient belief-propagation procedure. We apply it to a variety of models, including Ising-Glauber dynamics with symmetric and asymmetric couplings and the SIS model. Even for small $d$, the results are compatible with Monte Carlo estimates and accurately reproduce known exact solutions. The method gives access to accurate temporal correlations which, in some regimes, may be virtually impossible to estimate by sampling.</description>

      <title>Training the parametric interactions in an analog bosonic quantum neural network with Fock basis measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks have the potential to be seamlessly integrated with quantum devices for the automatic recognition of quantum states. However, performing complex tasks requires a large number of neurons densely connected through trainable, parameterized weights - a challenging feat when using qubits. To address this, we propose leveraging bosonic modes and performing Fock basis measurements, enabling the extraction of an exponential number of features relative to the number of modes. Unlike qubits, bosons can be coupled through multiple parametric drives, with amplitudes, phases, and frequency detunings serving dual purposes: data encoding and trainable parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters, despite their differing physical dimensions, can be trained cohesively using backpropagation to solve benchmark tasks of increasing complexity. Furthermore, we show that training significantly reduces the number of measurements required for feature extraction compared to untrained quantum neural networks, such as quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Distribution of the Diagonal Entries of the Resolvent of a Complex Ginibre Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of eigenvalue distributions in random matrix theory is often conducted by analyzing the resolvent matrix $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) = (z \mathbf{1} - \mathbf{M})^{-1} $. The normalized trace of the resolvent, known as the Stieltjes transform $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $, converges to a limit $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}(z) $ as the matrix dimension $ N $ grows, which provides the eigenvalue density $ \rho_{\mathbf{M}} $ in the large-$ N $ limit. In the Hermitian case, the distribution of $ \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $, now regarded as a random variable, is explicitly known when $ z $ lies within the limiting spectrum, and it coincides with the distribution of any diagonal entry of $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $.
  In this paper, we investigate what becomes of these results when $ \mathbf{M} $ is non-Hermitian. Our main result is the exact computation of the diagonal elements of $ \mathbf{G}_{\mathbf{M}}^N(z) $ when $ \mathbf{M} $ is a Ginibre matrix of size $ N $, as well as the high-dimensional limit for different regimes of $ z $, revealing a tail behavior connected to the statistics of the left and right eigenvectors. Interestingly, the limit distribution is stable under inversion, a property previously observed in the symmetric case. We then propose two general conjectures regarding the distribution of the diagonal elements of the resolvent and its normalized trace in the non-Hermitian case, both of which reveal a symmetry under inversion.</description>

      <title>Memristive Nanowire Network for Energy Efficient Audio Classification: Pre-Processing-Free Reservoir Computing with Reduced Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition is a key challenge in natural language processing, requiring low latency, efficient computation, and strong generalization for real-time applications. While software-based artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at this task, they are computationally intensive and depend heavily on data pre-processing. Neuromorphic computing, with its low-latency and energy-efficient advantages, holds promise for audio classification. Memristive nanowire networks, combined with pre-processing techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient extraction, have been widely used for associative learning, but such pre-processing can be power-intensive, undermining latency benefits. This study pioneers the use of memristive and spatio-temporal properties of nanowire networks for audio signal classification without pre-processing. A nanowire network simulation is paired with three linear classifiers for 10-class MNIST audio classification and binary speaker generalization tests. The hybrid system achieves significant benefits: excellent data compression with only 3% of nanowire output utilized, a 10-fold reduction in computational latency, and up to 28.5% improved classification accuracy (using a logistic regression classifier). Precision and recall improve by 10% and 17% for multispeaker datasets, and by 24% and 17% for individual speaker datasets, compared to raw data classifiers. This work provides a foundational proof of concept for utilizing memristive nanowire networks (NWN) in edge-computing devices, showcasing their potential for efficient, real-time audio signal processing with reduced computational overhead and power consumption, and enabling the development of advanced neuromorphic computing solutions.</description>

      <title>Open and trapping channels in complex resonant media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of the transmission and dwell-time matrices in disordered media composed of resonators, focusing on how frequency detuning influences their eigenvalue distributions. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of transmission eigenvalues undergoes a transition from a monomodal to a bimodal profile, and back to monomodal, as the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the particles. Moreover, the distribution of dwell-time eigenvalues broadens significantly near resonance, with the longest lifetimes exceeding the median by several orders of magnitude. These results are explained by examining how frequency $\omega$ affects the transport mean free path of light, $\ell(\omega)$, and the energy transport velocity, $v_E(\omega)$, which in turn shape the observed distributions. We demonstrate the strong potential of wavefront shaping to enhance both transmission and energy storage in resonant disordered media. In the diffusive regime, where the system thickness $L$ exceeds the mean free path, both transmission and dwell time can be enhanced by a factor $\varpropto L/\ell(\omega) \gg 1$ when using wavefronts associated with the largest eigenvalues instead of plane waves. In the localized regime, the enhancements become $\varpropto Ne^{2L/\xi}$ for transmission and $\varpropto N\xi /L$ for dwell time, where $\xi$ is the localization length and $N$ is the number of controlled scattering channels. Finally, we show that employing high-$Q$ resonators instead of low-$Q$ ones increases energy storage within the medium by a factor of $\varpropto Q/k\ell(\omega)$, in both the diffusive and localized regimes.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian transport in disordered systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) systems and models provide a versatile platform for emergent phenomena induced by strong electron correlation. In this work, we extend the newly developed real space neural network quantum Monte Carlo methods to study the quantum phase transition of electronic and magnetic properties. Hydrogen chains of different interatomic distances are explored systematically with both open and periodic boundary conditions, and fully correlated ground state many-body wavefunction is achieved via unsupervised training of neural networks. We demonstrate for the first time that neural networks are capable of capturing the quantum critical behavior of Tomonaga- Luttinger liquid (TLL), which is known to dominate 1D quantum systems. Moreover, we reveal the breakdown of TLL phase and the emergence of a Fermi liquid behavior, evidenced by abrupt changes in the spin structure and the momentum distribution. Such behavior is absent in commonly studied 1D lattice models and is likely due to the involvement of high-energy orbitals of hydrogen atoms. Our work highlights the powerfulness of neural networks for representing complex quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Critical analysis of multiple reentrant localization in an antiferromagnetic helix with transverse electric field: Hopping dimerization-free scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02778v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reentrant localization (RL), a recently prominent phenomenon, traditionally links to the interplay of staggered correlated disorder and hopping dimerization, as indicated by prior research. Contrary to this paradigm, our present study demonstrates that hopping dimerization is not a pivotal factor in realizing RL. Considering a helical magnetic system with antiferromagnetic ordering, we uncover spin-dependent RL at multiple energy regions, in the {\em absence} of hopping dimerization. This phenomenon persists even in the thermodynamic limit. The correlated disorder in the form of Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model is introduced by applying a transverse electric field to the helical system, circumventing the use of traditional substitutional disorder. We conduct a finite-size scaling analysis on the observed reentrant phases to identify critical points, determine associated critical exponents, and examine the scaling behavior linked to localization transitions. Additionally, we explore the parameter space to identify the conditions under which the reentrant phases occur. Described within a tight-binding framework, present work provides a novel outlook on RL, highlighting the crucial role of electric field, antiferromagnetic ordering, and the helicity of the geometry. Potential applications and experimental realizations of RL phenomena are also explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of volume exclusion on the local assembly of linear physical networks, where nodes and links are hard-core rigid objects. To do so, we introduce a minimal 3D model that helps us zoom into confined regions of these networks whose distant parts are sequentially connected by links with a very large aspect ratio. We show that the kinetics of link adhesion is logarithmic, as opposed to the algebraic growth in lower dimensions, and we attribute this qualitatively different behavior to a spontaneous delay of depletion forces caused by the 3D nature of the problem. Equally important, we find that this slow kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict an algebraic growth due to the formation of local bundles. Our findings offer a benchmark to study the local assembly of physical networks, with implications for non-equilibrium nest-like packings.</description>

      <title>Solution space and storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with generic activation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The storage capacity of a binary classification model is the maximum number of random input-output pairs per parameter that the model can learn. It is one of the indicators of the expressive power of machine learning models and is important for comparing the performance of various models. In this study, we analyze the structure of the solution space and the storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with general activation functions using the replica method from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that the storage capacity per parameter remains finite even with infinite width and that the weights of the network exhibit negative correlations, leading to a 'division of labor'. In addition, we find that increasing the dataset size triggers a phase transition at a certain transition point where the permutation symmetry of weights is broken, resulting in the solution space splitting into disjoint regions. We identify the dependence of this transition point and the storage capacity on the choice of activation function. These findings contribute to understanding the influence of activation functions and the number of parameters on the structure of the solution space, potentially offering insights for selecting appropriate architectures based on specific objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that topological phases include disordered materials if the underlying invariant is interpreted as originating from coarse geometry. This coarse geometric framework, grounded in physical principles, offers a natural setting for the bulk-boundary correspondence, reproduces physical knowledge, and leads to an efficient and tractable numerical approach for calculating invariants. As a showcase, we give a detailed discussion of the framework for three-dimensional systems with time-reversal symmetry. We numerically reproduce the known disorder-free phase diagram of a tunable, effective tight-binding model and analyze the evolution of the topological phase under disorder.</description>

      <title>Bias-inducing geometries: an exactly solvable data model with fairness implications</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) may be oblivious to human bias but it is not immune to its perpetuation. Marginalisation and iniquitous group representation are often traceable in the very data used for training, and may be reflected or even enhanced by the learning models. In the present work, we aim at clarifying the role played by data geometry in the emergence of ML bias. We introduce an exactly solvable high-dimensional model of data imbalance, where parametric control over the many bias-inducing factors allows for an extensive exploration of the bias inheritance mechanism. Through the tools of statistical physics, we analytically characterise the typical properties of learning models trained in this synthetic framework and obtain exact predictions for the observables that are commonly employed for fairness assessment. Despite the simplicity of the data model, we retrace and unpack typical unfairness behaviour observed on real-world datasets. We also obtain a detailed analytical characterisation of a class of bias mitigation strategies. We first consider a basic loss-reweighing scheme, which allows for an implicit minimisation of different unfairness metrics, and quantify the incompatibilities between some existing fairness criteria. Then, we consider a novel mitigation strategy based on a matched inference approach, consisting in the introduction of coupled learning models. Our theoretical analysis of this approach shows that the coupled strategy can strike superior fairness-accuracy trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing multiple memories from a single drive: The hysteron latch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium systems can form memories of previous deformations or driving. In systems from sheared glassy materials to buckling beams to crumpled sheets, this behavior is dominated by return-point memory, in which revisiting a past extremum of driving restores the system to a previous state. Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories -- as in a single-dial combination lock -- while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.</description>

      <title>Transformer Wave Function for two dimensional frustrated magnets: emergence of a Spin-Liquid Phase in the Shastry-Sutherland Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16889</link>

Abstract: Understanding quantum magnetism in two-dimensional systems represents a lively branch in modern condensed-matter physics. In the presence of competing super-exchange couplings, magnetic order is frustrated and can be suppressed down to zero temperature. Still, capturing the correct nature of the exact ground state is a highly complicated task, since energy gaps in the spectrum may be very small and states with different physical properties may have competing energies. Here, we introduce a variational Ansatz for two-dimensional frustrated magnets by leveraging the power of representation learning. The key idea is to use a particular deep neural network with real-valued parameters, a so-called Transformer, to map physical spin configurations into a high-dimensional feature space. Within this abstract space, the determination of the ground-state properties is simplified and requires only a shallow output layer with complex-valued parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of this variational Ansatz by studying the ground-state phase diagram of the Shastry-Sutherland model, which captures the low-temperature behavior of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ with its intriguing properties. With highly accurate numerical simulations, we provide strong evidence for the stabilization of a spin-liquid between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases. In addition, a direct calculation of the triplet excitation at the $\Gamma$ point provides compelling evidence for a gapless spin liquid. Our findings underscore the potential of Neural-Network Quantum States as a valuable tool for probing uncharted phases of matter, and open up new possibilities for establishing the properties of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Localization in two-dimensional fermions with arbitrary pseudospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, naturally generalizing the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of two-dimensional free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-$s$. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions and exploit their curious mathematical connection to Pascal's triangle to evaluate relevant quantities such as scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when the Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for integer (half-integer) $s$, irrespective of the band index. Remarkably, the localization corrections increase with $s$, but the relative localization corrections are found to decrease with $s$, i.e., faster-moving relativistic electrons are less susceptible to disorder effects. Coupled with our elementary analysis on electron-electron interactions, this sheds insights on Anderson and many-body localization in these materials.</description>
