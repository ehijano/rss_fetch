      <title>Single-doublet model of spin reorientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple theoretical model is developed to describe spin reorientation (SR) transitions in rare-earth orthoferrites and orthochromites RFeO3 and RCrO3. Within a ``single-doublet'' approach, the free energy includes anisotropy contributions from the 3d-sublattice and the splitting of the lower doublet of 4f-ions. The model predicts various types of SR transitions - first-order, second-order, and mixed - depending on anisotropy parameters. Effects of non-magnetic dilution, heat capacity anomalies, and behavior of the rare-earth magnetic moment in the SR region are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Hearing the light: stray-field noise from the emergent photon in quantum spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of the cumulant expansion method for the calculation of transport properties in electron-phonon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fr\"ohlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pair-density-wave superconductivity and Anderson's theorem in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.</description>

      <title>Canted ferromagnetic order in a distorted triangular-lattice magnet Na$_2$SrCo(VO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangular-lattice cobaltates with glaserite-type $X_2Y$Co($T$O$_4)_2$ structure provide an ideal platform to investigate intriguing quantum magnetism. Here we report a comprehensive study of the structural and magnetic properties of a triangular-lattice cobalt vanadate $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$. Room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction confirm that $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$ crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with slightly distorted triangular layers of $\rm Co^{2+}$ ions. Magnetization measurements reveal a ferromagnetic transition at $T\rm_C \approx 3.4~{\rm K}$, where a sharp $\lambda$-type anomaly is observed in the specific heat. The magnetic entropy recovered up to 55 K approaches 90$\%$ of $R{\rm ln}2$, supporting an effective spin-1/2 state of Co$^{2+}$ ions at low temperature. Neutron diffraction at 2.3 K (below $T_{\rm C}$) further confirms a long-range canted ferromagnetic order with the Co$^{2+}$ moments aligned in the $ac$ plane and the ordered moment size of $\sim$ 2.6 $\mu\rm_{B}$. Comparing with its sister compounds with a trigonal symmetry, $\rm Na_2BaCo(VO_4)_2$ with a collinear ferromagnetic structure and the recently discovered spin supersolid candidate $\rm Na_2BaCo(PO_4)_2$ with a distinct Y-like antiferromagnetic ground state, this study indicates the decisive role of the $T{\rm O_4}$ tetrahedra in tuning exchange interactions and contrasting magnetic behaviors of these glaserite-structure compounds.</description>

      <title>Study of Correlated Disorders and interaction in the Hofstadter Butterfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of several quasiperiodic disorders and their continuous interpolation with the Aubry-Andre (AA) potential on the Hofstadter butterfly using mean field approximation at zero temperature for a two-dimensional square lattice. Weak disorder mildly smears the fractal spectrum, while strong quasiperiodic potentials destroy the butterfly and generate multiple energy gaps. The AA potential produces the strongest spectral restructuring, creating prominent gaps near half-filling. Interpolating AA with other quasiperiodic potentials reveals competing gap-opening mechanisms, ranging from AA-dominated gaps at small interpolation parameters to a robust half-filling gap generated by the competing disorders at large parameters. Entanglement entropy follows the area law at low and high magnetic fields but shows pronounced deviations at intermediate fields, with opposite trends for strong AA versus other quasiperiodic potentials. Localization analysis using IPR and NPR confirms enhanced localization with increasing disorder; the AA potential yields the largest IPR, with notable field dependence. Interpolation produces smooth crossovers between distinct localization regimes.</description>

      <title>Sub-10 nm helices stabilized by single-ion anisotropy in the chiral Mott insulator Co$_5$TeO$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-gap Mott insulators promise exceptional opportunities for voltage-controlled magnetic textures in low-dissipation spintronics, although their prediction remains challenging. Here we employ a density functional theory-guided approach to predict a narrow charge-transfer gap (127 meV) in the chiral cubic frustrated oxide Co$_5$TeO$_8$. Comprehensive neutron scattering and magnetometry reveal proper-screw Bloch-type helices with field- and temperature-tunable pitch of 5.7-10 nm embedded in a complex phase diagram with eight distinct phases. Ab initio wavefunction calculations demonstrate site-dependent single-ion anisotropy exceeding Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions by an order of magnitude, establishing the anisotropy-frustration interplay as the stabilization mechanism, contrasting starkly with DM-dominated cubic helimagnets. Sharp capacitance anomalies at phase boundaries confirm intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling throughout the phase diagram. Co$_5$TeO$_8$ thus provides a platform for voltage-tunable sub-10 nm magnetic textures, demonstrating effective theory-guided discovery of functional magnetic materials in correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement of Anyonic Charges and Emergent Spacetime Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group for extremely correlated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At strong on-site repulsion $ U $, the fermionic Hubbard model realizes an extremely correlated electron system. In this regime, it is natural to derive the low-energy physics with the help of non-canonical operators acting on a projected Hilbert space without double occupancies. Using a strong-coupling functional renormalization group technique, we study the physics of such extreme correlations in the strict $ U = \infty $ limit, where only kinematic interactions due to the Hilbert space projection remain. For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic. At higher densities, we find a bad metal with strong magnetic correlations, indicating that the ground state is the Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities and a stripe antiferromagnet at intermediate densities. Both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic regimes, we observe a violation of Luttinger's theorem.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamical Scaling at Topological Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium driven dynamics at topologically nontrivial quantum critical points (QCPs),and find that topological edge modes at criticality give rise to anomalous universal dynamical scaling behavior. By analyzing the driven dynamics of bulk and boundary order parameters at topologically distinct Ising QCPs, we demonstrate that, while the bulk dynamics remain indistinguishable and follow standard Kibble Zurek (KZ) scaling, the anomalous boundary dynamics is unique to topological criticality, and its explanation goes beyond the traditional KZ mechanism. To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification of magnetic octupole current based on multipole representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic octupole (MO) currents have recently attracted significant attention as a driving force for the Neel vector dynamics in d-wave altermagnets, a new class of antiferromagnets that exhibit nonrelativistic spin-split band structures. From a symmetry perspective, the MO includes an axial-dipole component analogous to that of the spin, making it essential to clarify how MO currents differ from spin currents. We here investigate the correspondence between MO conductivities and electronic multipoles, which provide a unified and powerful framework for symmetry analysis. We derive the multipole representation of the rank-five MO conductivity tensor and classify its symmetry-allowed components for all crystallographic point groups, in direct comparison with spin conductivity. We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th. Our results elucidate the symmetry distinctions between MO currents and spin currents, and provide insights into their experimental identification.</description>

      <title>Large Isolated Stripes on Short 18-leg $t$-$J$ Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-charge stripes belong to the most prominent low-temperature orders besides superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>The fermion sign problem in Gauss law sectors of quantum link models with dynamical matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermion sign problem poses a formidable challenge to the use of Monte Carlo methods for lattice gauge theories with dynamical fermionic matter fields. A meron cluster algorithm recently formulated for gauge fields represented as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum links coupled to a single flavour of staggered fermions samples only two of the exponentially many Gauss law (GL) sectors at low temperatures, making it possible to simulate either of those two GL sectors at zero temperature in polynomial time. In this article, we analytically identify GL sectors which can be simulated without encountering the fermion sign problem in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and cluster Monte Carlo methods, we further explore the nature of phases in the GL sectors dominating at zero temperature. The vacuum states lie in sectors which satisfy a staggered Gauss law, in contrast to the zero GL sector familiar in particle physics. Moreover, we prove that while the ground state GL sectors do not suffer from the fermion sign problem, the usual zero-charge GL sector (often considered the physical sector) does. We outline the role of the magnetic energy in causing transitions between GL sectors. We expect our results to be valid for truncated Kogut-Susskind gauge theories, beyond quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantization by interaction of arbitrary strength in gapless flat bands with divergent quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, a lattice analogue of fractional quantum Hall effect, offers a unique pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation and deep insights into the interplay of topology and strong correlations. The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the design and implementation of a high-flux, high-efficiency magneto-infrared spectroscopy system optimized for broadband measurements in high magnetic fields. The setup integrates a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a 12 T cryogen-free superconducting magnet, precision-polished and gold-plated light tubes, custom-designed reflective focusing modules for Faraday and Voigt geometries, and an external multi-detector chamber with motorized selection. Optical throughput is maximized by reducing light tube loss from 65.5%/m to 22.0%/m via abrasive flow and mechanical polishing followed by gold electroplating, and by adopting a single-on-axis parabolic-mirror Faraday module that increases the effective numerical aperture from 0.14 to 0.36, enhancing collection efficiency by nearly an order of magnitude. An eight-position motorized sample stage and fully automated control over magnetic field, temperature, optical path, and detector choice enable high-throughput measurements without repeated warm-ups. The optimized configuration achieves a root-mean-square noise level of 0.0061% in a 2-minute integration for a 40% reflectivity sample, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 16000. System capabilities are demonstrated by resolving weak replica bands in EuCd2As2 and faint Landau level transitions in LaAlSi.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Changes in Structure, Magnetic Order and Development of Superconductivity in the Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi8Te13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n &lt; 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Band-Split Magnetism in Magnetostrictive CoFe$_2$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single crystal spinel CoFe$_2$O$_4$ exhibits the largest room-temperature saturation magnetostriction among non-rare-earth compounds and a high Curie temperature ($T_c \sim 780$ K), properties that are critical to a wide range of industrial and medical applications. Neutron spectroscopy reveals a large band splitting ($\sim$ 60 meV) between two ferrimagnetic magnon branches, which is driven by site mixing between Co$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ cations, and a significantly weaker magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($\sim$ 3 meV). Central to this behavior is the competition between extremely large mismatched molecular fields on the tetrahedral $A$-site and octahedral $B$-site sublattices and the single-ion anisotropy on the $B$-site. This creates a strong energetic anisotropy that locks the magnetic moment within each structural domain in place. As a result of these differing energy scales, switching structural domains is energetically favored over a global spin reorientation under applied magnetic fields, and this is what amplifies the magnetostrictive nature of CoFe$_2$O$_4$.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.</description>

      <title>`Interaction annealing' to determine effective quantized valence and orbital structure: an illustration with ferro-orbital order in WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, upon absorbing rapid quantum fluctuations, these rich low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbital structure. Such a powerful and simple description is, however, difficult to access through bare particles used in most many-body computations, especially when fluctuations are strong such as in $4d$ and $5d$ compounds. To decipher the dominant quantized structure, we propose an easy-to-implement `interaction annealing' approach that utilizes suppressed charge fluctuation through enhancing ionic charging energy. We establish its theoretical foundation using an exactly treated two-site Hubbard model as a generic example. We then demonstrate its applications with more affordable density functional calculations to a representative $3d$ Mott insulator La${_2}$CuO${_4}$ and a highly fluctuating $5d$ semi-metal WTe${_2}$. In the latter, it reveals an emergent local electronic structure that makes possible an unprecedented explanation of several experimental observations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in studying competing local electronic structures in functional materials.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Magnetism in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for smaller twist angles. At larger twist angles, the system hosts a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. On the other hand, the layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Our results demonstrate that long-range exchange in a symmetry-unbroken parent state with strongly renormalized moir\'e bands provides a broadly applicable framework to understand itinerant magnetism in moir\'e TMDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the hierarchy of correlations in the context of a Fermi-Hubbard model, we deduce the presence of quasi-particle bound states at the interface between a Mott insulator and a semiconductor, as well as within a semiconductor-Mott-semiconductor heterostructure forming a quantum well. In the case of the solitary interface, the existence of bound states necessitates the presence of an additional perturbation with a minimal strength depending on the spin background of the Mott insulator. Conversely, within the quantum well, this additional perturbation is still required to have bound states while standing-wave solutions even exist in its absence.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Mediated Cross-Layer Pairing in Pressurized Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional Hubbard model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</description>

Abstract: We provide an exact evaluation of the out-of-time correlation (OTOC) functions for the localized $f$-particle states in the Falicov-Kimball model within dynamical mean-field theory. Different regimes of quantum chaos and quantum scrambling are distinguished by the winding numbers of the block Toeplitz matrices used in the calculation. The similarities of these fermionic OTOCs and their logarithmic derivatives for time evolution with the OTOCs for quantum spin models with disorder are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.</description>

Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop an extension of the fermionic functional renormalization group for systems where strong correlations give rise to projected Hilbert spaces. We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly.</description>

Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Hall Phase in the Truncated Trihexagonal Lattice: A Topological Archimedean Structure</title>

Abstract: Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome and snub square lattices, the simplest members of the Archimedean lattice family, have been extensively investigated -- the former as a paradigmatic system for geometric frustration and nontrivial band topology, and the latter primarily as a quasicrystal approximant -- the broader family remains largely unexplored in terms of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic Python-based tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, modeled as two-dimensional carbon-based networks serving as a proof-of-principle system. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and give rise to quantized spin Hall currents.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in holographic fractonic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17404</link>

Abstract: Fractonic phases of matter, a class of states in which collective excitations with constrained mobility exist, were originally discovered in the study of quantum error-correcting codes in solvable lattice spin models such as Haah's code and the X-cube model. Recently, they have also drawn the attention of the high-energy physics community due to the UV/IR mixing that arises when coarse-graining these lattice models. In this work, we consider a (3+1)-dimensional holographic model of fractonic solids and investigate the low-energy collective dynamics systematically. By computing the quasinormal modes of black holes, we obtain all the hydrodynamic excitations on the boundary, including two acoustic phonons, a longitudinal diffusive mode, and a subdiffusive collective mode with the dispersion $\omega \sim-ik^4$. In addition, it is found that the latter remains gapless when translational symmetry is explicitly broken. These results suggest that the subdiffusive mode is inherently protected by the crystal-dipole symmetry in solids and is qualitatively unaffected by broken spacetime symmetries.</description>
