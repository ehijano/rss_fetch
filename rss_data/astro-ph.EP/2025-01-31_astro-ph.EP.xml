      <title>Tracing the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone with Sulfur Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumstellar liquid-water habitable zone guides our search for potentially inhabited exoplanets, but remains observationally untested. We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modelling we find that the observability of sulfur-gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur-gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalise this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur-chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the Habitable Zone in the near-future.</description>

      <title>Subtle and Spectacular: Diverse White Dwarf Debris Disks Revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports 12 novel spectroscopic detections of warm circumstellar dust orbiting polluted white dwarfs using JWST MIRI. The disks span two orders of magnitude in fractional infrared brightness and more than double the number of white dwarf dust spectra available for mineralogical study. Among the highlights are: i) the two most subtle infrared excesses yet detected, ii) the strongest silicate emission features known for any debris disk orbiting any main-sequence or white dwarf star, iii) one disk with a thermal continuum but no silicate emission, and iv) three sources with likely spectral signatures of silica glass. The near ubiquity of solid-state emission requires small dust grains that are optically thin, and thus must be replenished on year-to-decade timescales by ongoing collisions. The disk exhibiting a featureless continuum can only be fit by dust temperatures in excess of 2000K, implying highly refractory material comprised of large particles, or non-silicate mineral species. If confirmed, the glassy silica orbiting three stars could be indicative of high-temperature processes and subsequent rapid cooling, such as occur in high-velocity impacts or vulcanism. These detections have been enabled by the unprecedented sensitivity of MIRI LRS spectroscopy and highlight the capability and potential for further observations in future cycles.</description>

      <title>Strong clumping in global streaming instability simulations with a dusty fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: How planets form in protoplanetary disks and what drives the formation of their seeds is still a major unknown. It is an accepted theory that multiple processes can trap dusty material in radially narrow rings or vortex-like structures, preventing the dust from drifting inwards. However, the relevant process for clumping this dusty material until it collapses under gravity still needs to be identified. One promising candidate is the streaming instability arising from the aerodynamic interaction between dust and gas once they reach similar densities. Aims: We investigate with a global disk model based on recent observational constraints if streaming instability can form dust clumps, which might gravitationally collapse. Further, our goal is to verify the observability of the produced structures using ALMA or ngVLA. Methods. For the first time, we present global 2D (R, z) hydrodynamic simulations using FARGO3D in which the dust is treated as a pressureless fluid. The disk model assumes stratification, realistic boundary conditions, and meaningful resolution to resolve the fast-growing modes. We choose two values for the total dust-to-gas mass ratio Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02, compare the maximum clump density to the local Hill density, and compute the optical depth of the dust disk. Results: With a dust-to-gas mass ratio of Z = 0.01, we confirm previous streaming instability simulations, not showing the ability to form strong concentrations of dust clumps. With Z = 0.02, dense clumps form within 20 orbits, however reaching only 30% of the Hill density even following disk parameters from the massive protoplanetary disks GM Aur, HD163296, IM Lup, MWC 480, and TW Hya, which all share astonishingly similar surface density profiles.</description>

      <title>Three fast-rotating Jovian Trojans identified by TESS set new population density limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report on the identification of the three fastest rotating Jovian Trojans with reliable population assignment, using light curve data from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey mission, also confirmed by Zwicky Transient Facility data. For two of our targets the rotation periods are moderately below the previously accepted ~5 h Jovian Trojan breakup limit (4.26 and 4.75 h), however, the rotation period of (13383) was found to be P = 2.926 h, leading to a density estimate of $\rho$ $\approx$ 1.6 $g cm^{-3}$, higher than the generally accepted $\leq$ 1 $g cm^{-3}$ density limit of Jovian Trojans. If associated with lower densities, this rotation rate requires considerable cohesion in the order of a few kPa. The relatively high albedo (pV $\approx$ 0.11) and fast rotation suggest that (13383) may have undergone an energetic collision that spun up the body and exposed bright material to the surface.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec Transmission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet in our galaxy. Interior structure models suggest that the coldest sub-Neptunes could host liquid water oceans underneath their hydrogen envelopes - sometimes called 'hycean' planets. JWST transmission spectra of the $\sim$ 250 K sub-Neptune K2-18 b were recently used to report detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$, alongside weaker evidence of (CH$_3$)$_2$S (dimethyl sulfide, or DMS). Atmospheric CO$_2$ was interpreted as evidence for a liquid water ocean, while DMS was highlighted as a potential biomarker. However, these notable claims were derived using a single data reduction and retrieval modeling framework, which did not allow for standard robustness tests. Here we present a comprehensive reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H transmission spectra, including the first analysis of the second-order NIRISS SOSS data. We incorporate multiple well-tested data reduction pipelines and retrieval codes, spanning 60 different data treatments and over 250 atmospheric retrievals. We confirm the detection of CH$_4$ ($\approx$ 4$\sigma$), with a volume mixing ratio of log CH$_4$ = $-1.15^{+0.40}_{-0.52}$, but we find no statistically significant or reliable evidence for CO$_2$ or DMS. Finally, we quantify the observed atmospheric composition using photochemical-climate and interior models, demonstrating that our revised composition of K2-18 b can be explained by an oxygen-poor mini-Neptune without requiring a liquid water surface or life.</description>

      <title>Low-Thrust Many-Revolution Trajectory Design Under Operational Uncertainties for DESTINY+ Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESTINY+ is a planned JAXA medium-class Epsilon mission from Earth to deep space using a low-thrust, many-revolution orbit. Such a trajectory design is a challenging problem not only for trajectory design but also for flight operations, and in particular, it is essential to evaluate the impact of operational uncertainties to ensure mission success. In this study, we design the low-thrust trajectory from Earth orbit to a lunar transfer orbit by differential dynamic programming using the Sundman transformation. The results of Monte Carlo simulations with operational uncertainties confirm that the spacecraft can be successfully guided to the lunar transfer orbit by using the feedback control law of differential dynamic programming in the angular domain.</description>

      <title>NEATH IV: an early onset of complex organic chemistry in molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) are widely detected in protostellar and protoplanetary systems, where they are thought to have been inherited in large part from earlier evolutionary phases. The chemistry of COMs in these earlier phases, namely starless and prestellar cores, remains poorly understood, as models often struggle to reproduce the observed gas-phase abundances of these species. We simulate the formation of a molecular cloud, and the cores within it, out of the diffuse interstellar medium, and follow the chemical evolution of the cloud material starting from purely-atomic initial conditions. We find that the formation of both gas- and ice-phase COMs precedes the formation of cores as distinct objects, beginning at gas densities of a few $10^3 \,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. Much of this COM-enriched material remains at these relatively modest densities for several Myr, which may provide a reservoir for accretion onto planet-forming discs in later evolutionary stages. We suggest that models of core and disc chemistry should not ignore the complex dynamical evolution which precedes these structures, even when studying supposedly late-forming molecules such as CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN.</description>

      <title>Characterising the multiple protostellar system VLA 1623-2417 with JWST, ALMA and VLA: outflow origins, dust growth and an unsettled disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilising JWST, ALMA and the VLA we present high angular resolution (0.06''- 0.42''), multi-wavelength (4 micron - 3cm) observations of the VLA 1623-2417 protostellar system to characterise the origin, morphology and, properties of the continuum emission. JWST observations at 4.4 micron reveal outflow cavities for VLA 1623 A and, for the first time, VLA 1623 B, as well as scattered light from the upper layers of the VLA 1623 W disk. We model the millimetre-centimetre spectral energy distributions to quantify the relative contributions of dust and ionised gas emission, calculate dust masses, and use spectral index maps to determine where optical depth hinders this analysis. In general, all objects appear to be optically thick down to ~90 GHz, show evidence for significant amounts (10's - 100's M_Earth) of large (&gt;1 mm) dust grains, and are dominated by ionised gas emission for frequencies ~&lt;15 GHz. In addition, we find evidence of unsettled millimetre dust in the inclined disk of VLA 1623 B possibly attributed to instabilities within the circumstellar disk, adding to the growing catalogue of unsettled Class 0/I disks. Our results represent some of the highest resolution observations possible with current instrumentation, particularly in the case of the VLA. However, our interpretation is still limited at low frequencies (~&lt;22 GHz) and thus motivates the need for next-generation interferometers operating at centimetre wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Separated twins or just siblings? A multi-planet system around an M dwarf including a cool sub-Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two TESS sub-Neptunes orbiting the early M dwarf TOI-904 (TIC 261257684). Both exoplanets, TOI-904 b and c, were initially observed in TESS Sector 12 with twin sizes of ${2.426}_{-0.157}^{+0.163}$ and ${2.167}_{-0.118}^{+0.130}$ R$_\oplus$, respectively. Through observations in five additional sectors in the TESS primary mission and the first and second extended missions, the orbital periods of the planets were measured to be 10.887$\pm$0.001 and 83.999$\pm$0.001 days, respectively. Reconnaissance radial velocity measurements (taken with EULER/CORALIE and SMARTS/CHIRON) and high-resolution speckle imaging with adaptive optics (obtained from SOAR/HRCAM and Gemini South/ZORRO) show no evidence of an eclipsing binary or a nearby companion, which, together with the low false-positive probabilities calculated with the statistical validation software TRICERATOPS, establishes the planetary nature of these candidates. The outer planet, TOI-904 c, is the longest-period M dwarf exoplanet found by TESS, with an estimated equilibrium temperature of 217 K. As the three other validated planets with comparable host stars and orbital periods were observed by Kepler around much dimmer stars (J mag &gt; 12), TOI-904 c, orbiting a brighter star (J mag = 9.6), is the coldest M dwarf planet easily accessible for atmospheric follow-up. Future mass measurements and transmission spectroscopy of the similar-sized planets in this system could determine whether they are also similar in density and composition, suggesting a common formation pathway, or whether they have distinct origins.</description>

      <title>MARFA: an Effective Line-by-line Tool For Calculating Molecular Absorption in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- an open-source line-by-line tool for calculating absorption coefficients and cross-sections in planetary atmospheres, particularly under conditions of uncertain spectroscopic data and missing continuum functions. MARFA employs an eleven-grid interpolation technique, enabling accurate and efficient computation of far-wing contributions for large line cut-offs. The tool supports flexible parameterization, including line shape functions, wing corrections, user-defined atmospheric profiles, thus, facilitating rapid sensitivity studies for sparse datasets. Spectra are calculated at a high-resolution of about 5E-4 cm-1, optimized for infrared and visible spectral regions where HITRAN-formatted line data is available, yet adaptable to other datasets with available line parameters. Output is represented either in a form of binary lookup tables files, directly compatible with radiative transfer codes or in a human-readable format for data analysis and distribution. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web application accessible at marfa.app for onboarding and educational usage, and as an open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

      <title>Connection between planetary He I $\lambda$10830 \AA\ absorption and extreme-ultraviolet emission of planet-host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The detection of the He I 10830 A triplet in exoplanet atmospheres has opened a new window for probing planetary properties, including atmospheric escape. Unlike Lyman alpha, the triplet is less affected by ISM absorption. Sufficient XUV stellar irradiation may trigger the formation of the He I triplet via photoionization and posterior recombination processes in the planet atmospheres. Only a weak trend between stellar XUV and the planetary He I strength has been observed so far. Aims. We aim to confirm this mechanism for producing the He I absorption in exoplanetary atmospheres by examining a sample of planetary systems. Methods. We obtained homogeneous measurements of the planetary He I line EW and consistently computed the stellar XUV ionizing irradiation. We first derived new coronal models for the planet-host stars. We used updated data from the X-exoplanets database, archival X-ray spectra of M-type stars (including AU Mic and Proxima Cen), and new XMM-Newton X-ray data obtained for the CARMENES project. These data were complemented at longer wavelengths with publicly available HST, FUSE, and EUVE spectra. A total of 75 stars are carefully analyzed to obtain a new calibration between X-ray and EUV emission. Results. Two distinct relationships between stellar X-ray emission (5-100 A) and EUV_H (100-920 A) or EUV_He (100-504 A) radiation are obtained to scale the emission from late-type stellar coronae. A total of 48 systems with reported planetary He I 10830 A studies, exhibit a robust relationship between the planetary He I feature and the ionizing XUV_He received by the planet, corrected by stellar and planetary radii, and the planet's gravitational potential. Some outliers could be explained by a different atmospheric composition or the lack of planetary gaseous atmospheres. This relation may be used to predict the He I 10830 A absorption in exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of exoplanet discoveries in exotic environments like the Neptune desert challenges our understanding of planetary atmospheres under intense irradiation. The unexpected discovery of LTT9779 b, an ultra-hot Neptune within this desert, offers a prime opportunity for atmospheric studies. We build on prior observations of LTT9779 b from TESS, Spitzer, and CHEOPS, incorporating new VLT/ESPRESSO data to probe its atmospheric dynamics. Preliminary analyses suggest a metal-rich atmosphere and a high day-side geometric albedo, possibly indicating silicate clouds. Minimal atmospheric escape is observed, contrasting existing models of planetary evolution under extreme irradiation. We obtained the transmission spectrum of LTT9779 b between 0.4 and 0.78 microns with ESPRESSO, addressing systematics across three transits. Our analysis focused on the sodium doublet and H-alpha, using cross-correlation with models containing Na, K, FeH, TiO, and VO. No significant atmospheric signal was detected, with metallicity limits set at [Fe/H] $\geq$ 2.25 ($\geq$ 180 times solar). The non-detection aligns with a high-metallicity, cloud-free model, implying a high mean molecular weight and reduced atmospheric scale height. We interpret this as evidence for a metal-rich atmosphere with suppressed spectral features, possibly due to high-altitude clouds or hazes. These findings are consistent with JWST observations, supporting the hypothesis of metal-rich atmospheres obscured by aerosols in extreme environments.</description>
