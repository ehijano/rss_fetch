      <title>Hybrid broadband conduction and amplitude-driven topological confinement of sound via syntheticacoustic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise wave manipulation has undoubtedly forged the technological landscape we thrive in today. Although our understanding of wave phenomena has come a long way since the earliest observations of desert dunes or ocean waves, the unimpeded development of mathematics has enabled ever more complex and exotic physical phenomena to be comprehensively described. Here, we take wave manipulation a step further by introducing an unprecedented synthetic acoustic crystal capable of realizing simultaneous linear broadband conduction and nonlinear topological insulation, depicting a robust amplitude-dependent mode localized deep within - i.e. an amplitude-driven topological confinement of sound. The latter is achieved by means of an open acoustic waveguide lined with a chain of nonlocally and nonlinearly coupled active electroacoustic resonators. Starting from a comprehensive topological model for classical waves, we demonstrate that different topological regimes can be accessed by increasing driving amplitude and that topological robustness against coupling disorder is a direct consequence of symmetric and simultaneous response between coupled resonators. Theoretical predictions are validated by a fully programmable experimental apparatus capable of realizing the real-time manipulation of metacrystal properties. In all, our results provide a solid foundation for future research in the design and manipulation of classical waves in artificial materials involving nonlinearity, nonlocality, and non-hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Characterization of AlGaAs/GeSn heterojunction band alignment via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GeSn-based SWIR lasers featuring imaging, sensing, and communications has gained dynamic development recently. However, the existing SiGeSn/GeSn double heterostructure lacks adequate electron confinement and is insufficient for room temperature lasing. The recently demonstrated semiconductor grafting technique provides a viable approach towards AlGaAs/GeSn p-i-n heterojunctions with better electron confinement and high-quality interfaces, promising for room temperature electrically pumped GeSn laser devices. Therefore, understanding and quantitatively characterizing the band alignment in this grafted heterojunction is crucial. In this study, we explore the band alignment in the grafted monocrystalline Al0.3Ga0.7As /Ge0.853Sn0.147 p-i-n heterojunction. We determined the bandgap values of AlGaAs and GeSn to be 1.81 eV and 0.434 eV by photoluminescence measurements, respectively. We further conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and extracted a valence band offset of 0.19 eV and a conduction band offset of 1.186 eV. A Type-I band alignment was confirmed which effectively confining electrons at the AlGaAs/GeSn interface. This study improves our understanding of the interfacial band structure in grafted AlGaAs/GeSn heterostructure, providing experimental evidence of the Type-I band alignment between AlGaAs and GeSn, and paving the way for their application in laser technologies.</description>

      <title>Full-Field Quantitative Visualization of Shock-Driven Pore Collapse and Failure Modes in PMMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic collapse of pores under shock loading is thought to be directly related to hot spot generation and material failure, which is critical to the performance of porous energetic and structural materials. However, the shock compression response of porous materials at the local, individual pore scale is not well understood. This study examines, quantitatively, the collapse phenomenon of a single spherical void in PMMA at shock stresses ranging from 0.4-1.0 GPa. Using a newly developed internal digital image correlation technique in conjunction with plate impact experiments, full-field quantitative deformation measurements are conducted in the material surrounding the collapsing pore for the first time. The experimental results reveal two failure mode transitions as shock stress is increased: (i) the first in-situ evidence of shear localization via adiabatic shear banding and (ii) dynamic fracture initiation at the pore surface. Numerical simulations using thermo-viscoplastic dynamic finite element analysis provide insights into the formation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) and stresses at which failure mode transitions occur. Further numerical and theoretical modeling indicates the dynamic fracture to occur along the weakened material inside an adiabatic shear band. Finally, analysis of the evolution of pore asymmetry and models for ASB spacing elucidate the mechanisms for the shear band initiation sites, and elastostatic theory explains the experimentally observed ASB and fracture paths based on the directions of maximum shear.</description>

      <title>Suspended lithium niobate acoustic resonators with buried electrodes for radiofrequency filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data rates and volume for mobile communication are ever-increasing with the growing number of users and connected devices. With the deployment of 5G and 6G on the horizon, wireless communication is advancing to higher frequencies and larger bandwidths enabling higher speeds and throughput. Current micro-acoustic resonator technology, a key component in radiofrequency front end filters, is struggling to keep pace with these developments. This work presents a novel acoustic resonator architecture enabling multi-frequency, low-loss, and wideband filtering for the 5G and future 6G bands located above 3 GHz. Thanks to the exceptional performance of these resonators, filters for the 5G n77 and n79 bands are demonstrated, exhibiting fractional bandwidths of 13% and 25% respectively with low insertion loss of around 1 dB. With its unique frequency scalability and wideband capabilities, the reported architecture offers a promising option for filtering and multiplexing in future mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Gain-Bandwidth-Product-Induced Technical Bound in Time Transfer System without Inline Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time transfer plays a dispensable role in many fields including navigation and positioning, geodesy, and fundamental tests. However, in certain scenarios where effective relay node deployment is often not feasible, such as harsh environments with extremely poor infrastructure and emergency conditions, effective time transfer without inline amplifiers becomes crucial. In this situation, the maximum transmission distance is limited by the receiver's measurement capability, particularly its ability to amplify the signal. Here we propose a theoretical model, giving a technical lower bound of the detected signal stability at different transmission distances, induced by limited gain-bandwidth products. The results under common gain-bandwidth products show that while for shorter transmission distances, stability is mainly limited by the background noise of the time interval counter, for longer distances reaching the scale of 300 kilometers, the technical lower bound is below the level of 10 nanoseconds without any inline amplification devices. Therefore, the given technical bound offers guidance on managing the balance between distance and stability, together with the optimization of the receiver in long-distance time transfer without inline amplification.</description>

      <title>Droplet size and velocity measurements in a cryogenic jet flame of a rocket-type combustor using high speed imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Injectors of cryogenic liquid rocket engines produce large polydisperse and dense sprays due to the pressure and mass flow conditions. Atomization is the dominating process that drives the flame behaviour in cryogenic jet flames, when the propellants are injected in subcritical conditions. The main objective of this study is the characterization of a liquid oxygen (LOX) spray in gaseous hydrogen (GH2), in reacting conditions. In the breakup region where liquid particles are not spherical, laser based drop size techniques suffer from a low validation data rate, thus imaging techniques can be better suited to characterize the spray. High speed shadowgraphs were used to provide the spray characteristics such as sizes and velocities of the LOX dispersed phase atomized by a GH2 co-flow injected by a shear coaxial injector in a 1MPa combustion chamber. Cryogenic combustion investigations presented in this paper were carried out on the Mascotte test bench, at Onera. The reacting case was compared qualitatively to a cold flow test, with gaseous He instead of GH2, for which LOX spray shadowgraphs were also recorded. Velocity of the dispersed phase in reacting conditions was obtained with two different imaging methods, which were applied to the same shadowgraphs: a PTV algorithm and a PIV software, developed at Onera. Droplet sizes were measured by image processing in the atomization zone and results were compared with Sauter mean diameters obtained with phase Doppler measurements from the literature. The droplet size is combined with PTV to obtain droplet size/velocity correlations which show the influence of the flame on the droplet size evolution.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells via MultiFunctional Curcumin Modified Buried Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The buried interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer suffers from severe interface defects and imperfect energy level alignment. To address this issue, this study employs a multifunctional organic molecule, curcumin, to modify the interface between SnO2 and the perovskite layer. The functional groups on curcumin effectively passivate the defects on both sides of the interface, reducing -OH and oxygen vacancy defects on the SnO2 surface and passivating uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite layer. This results in a more compatible energy level alignment and lower defect density at the interface, enhancing carrier transport across it. Consequently, the devices based on curcumin achieve an impressive champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.46%, compared to 22.03% for control devices. This work demonstrates a simple, green, hydrophobic, and efficient molecular modification method for the buried interface, laying the foundation for the development of high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Performance Metrics and Loss Mechanisms in Horticulture Luminescent Solar Concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horticulture Luminescent Solar Concentrators (HLSCs) represent an innovative concept developed in recent years to promote crop yields, building upon the foundation of traditional Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs). HLSCs are characterized by two distinct properties: spectral conversion and light extraction. Unlike traditional LSCs, HLSCs focus on converting energy from one part of the solar spectrum (typically green) to a specific range (usually red) and aim for the converted photons to exit the device from the bottom surface rather than the edge surfaces. In this study, we start by examining the specific requirements of horticulture to clarify the motivation for using HLSCs. We re-evaluate and propose new optical metrics tailored to HLSCs. Additionally, we analyse potential loss channels for direct red emission and converted red emission. Utilizing Monte Carlo ray tracing method and experimental data, we further explore the factors influencing these loss channels. Our work provides a fundamental discussion on HLSCs and offers design guidelines for future HLSC research.</description>

      <title>Equivalent circuit modeling of electron-hole recombination in semiconductor and mixed ionic-electronic conductor based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The understanding and optimization of solar energy conversion and light emitting devices can greatly benefit from equivalent circuit models describing their response. However, a general model of electron-hole recombination in semiconductors is currently missing. This study presents equivalent circuit models of radiative and non-radiative electron-hole recombination based on their linearized analytical treatment. These are integrated in a circuit model of complete devices that is equivalent to the linearized drift-diffusion equations in one dimension. The analysis of the model shows that, for most situations involving semiconductors without mobile ions, approximated models that do not account for local electrostatics are sufficient to describe the contribution of recombination to the device response. The influence of local electrostatics on non-radiative trap-mediated and Auger recombination becomes essential in mixed conducting devices, and it should be included explicitly in equivalent circuit models. Resistors used for traditional semiconductors are indeed a special case of the general model of non-radiative recombination, for which transistors gated by the local change in electrostatic potential implement a more accurate representation. For mixed conducting devices, such as halide perovskite solar cells, appropriate simplifications of the complete model provide analytical solutions describing the bulk and interfacial polarization effects that influence the small signal electrostatics, recombination currents and overall impedance. The resulting analysis is relevant to a wide range of materials and devices used for solar energy conversion as well as other optoelectronic and photo-electrochemical applications.</description>
