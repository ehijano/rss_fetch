      <title>On the importance of separators as sites of 3D magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For 3D magnetic reconnection to occur there must exist a volume within which the electric field component parallel to the magnetic field is non-zero. In numerical experiments, locations of non-zero parallel electric field indicate sites of 3D magnetic reconnection. If these experiments contain all types of topological feature (null points, separatrix surfaces, spines and separators) then comparing topological features with the reconnection sites reveals that all the reconnection sites are threaded by separators with the local maxima/minima of the integrated parallel electric along fieldlines coinciding with these separators. However, not all separators thread a reconnection site. Furthermore, there are different types of separator. Cluster separators are short arising within an individual weak magnetic field region and have negligible parallel electric field along them so are not associated with much reconnection. Intercluster separators connect a positive null point lying in one weak-field region to a negative null point that lies in a different weak-field region. Intercluster separators often thread enhanced regions of parallel electric field and are long. Since separators form the boundary between 4 globally-significant topologically-distinct domains, they are important sites of reconnection which can results in the global restructuring of the magnetic field. By considering the kinematic bifurcation models in which separators form it is possible to understand the formation of cluster and intercluster separators and explain their key properties.</description>

      <title>Lunar Time in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the general-relativistic definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) based on the IAU 2000 resolutions that provide a framework for relativistic reference systems. From this foundation, we derive a transformation equation that describes the relative rate of TCL with respect to Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) for various locations of the clock on lunar surface. This equation serves as the cornerstone for constructing a relativistic TCL--TCG time conversion algorithm. Using this algorithm, we can compute both secular and periodic variations in the rate of an atomic clock placed on the Moon, relative to an identical clock on Earth. The algorithm accounts for various effects, including time dilation caused by the Moon's orbital motion around Earth, gravitational potentials of both Earth and Moon, and direct and indirect time dilation effects due to tidal perturbations caused by the Sun and other major planets of the solar system. Our approach provides exquisite details of the TCL--TCG transformation, achieving a precision of several nanoseconds within the spatial volume dominated by the Earth's gravitational field known as the Hill sphere. This sphere extends from the Earth to a distance of approximately 1.5 million km, substantially encompassing the Moon's orbit. To validate our methodology for lunar coordinate time, we compare it with the mathematical formalism of local inertial frames applied to the Earth-Moon system and confirm their equivalence.</description>
