      <title>Cavity Controls Core-to-Core Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray cavity quantum optics with inner-shell transitions has been hindered by the overlap between resonant and continuum states. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of cavity-controlled co-to-core resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We eliminate the effects of the absorption edge by monitoring the RIXS profile, thereby resolving the resonant state from the overlapping continuum. We observe distinct cavity-induced energy shifts and cavity-enhanced decay rate in the $2p3d$ RIXS spectra of WSi$_{2}$. These effects, manifesting as stretched or shifted profiles in the RIXS planes, enable novel spectroscopic applications by cavity-controlled core-hole states. Our results establish core-to-core RIXS as a powerful tool for manipulating inner-shell dynamics in x-ray cavities, offering new avenues for integrating quanutm optical effects with x-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Process Tomography of a Room-Temperature Alkali-Metal Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a technique for reconstructing the dynamics of open quantum systems under the Born-Markov approximation, as described by a Liouvillian superoperator, capturing both coherent and dissipative processes. While QPT is well established for qubits, it presents significant experimental challenges in multi-level qudits. In room-temperature atomic vapors, these difficulties arise from complex interactions, residual fields present in the system, environmental noise, and inhomogeneities in the medium. Overcoming these limitations is essential for accurate modeling and precise control of such systems--a critical step toward practical usage of the QPT. We present a QPT method that we experimentally validate on a room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor ensemble, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians. Our approach establishes a computationally efficient framework for characterizing open quantum systems, enabling the study of non-unitary dynamics, efficient benchmarking of quantum sensors, and data-driven identification of environmental noise correlations.</description>

      <title>Study of low-energy electron-induced dissociation of 1-Propanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fragmentation of 1-propanol resulting from dissociative electron attachment has been explored across an energy range of 3.5 to 16 eV. Four distinct ion species are identified: $\text{H}^{-}$, $\text{O}^{-}$, $\text{OH}^{-}$, and $\text{C}_{3}\text{H}_{7}\text{O}^{-}$. The $\text{OH}^{-}$ ion exhibited a prominent peak near 8.7 eV, along with a small hump near 5.6 eV. Complementary channels led to the formation of the $\text{H}^{-}$ and $\text{C}_{3}\text{H}_{7}\text{O}^{-}$ ions. Both these two ions exhibit a sharp peak near 6 eV and broad overlapping resonances between 7 to 12 eV. The observed ion yields of distinct dissociation fragments in this study, when compared with those from previously studied alcohols, suggest site-specific fragmentation of alcohols during dissociative electron attachment. To gain a deeper understanding of the dissociation pathways, Density Functional Theory~(DFT) calculations were conducted, revealing the threshold energies for each channel. These threshold energies aligned well with the experimental uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Excitonic skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that strong interactions combined with band-dependent imaginary vector potentials give rise to boundary localization of particle-hole pairs, which we term the excitonic skin effect. In a bilayer system with layer-specific gain/loss and an in-plane magnetic field, excitons experience a net imaginary vector potential, resulting in directional amplification of particle-hole pairs. Including nearest-neighbor interactions leads to a non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model, where the pairing effects grow exponentially with the size of the system, revealing a unique form of critical skin effect in interacting systems. Our framework applies to both atomic and electronic platforms and is directly testable in current experiments. These results also provide a route to explore non-Hermitian analogs of tensor gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Superheterodyne Rydberg S-band receiver with a multi-tone local oscillator based on an atomic transition loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>
