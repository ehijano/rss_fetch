      <title>Radio Frequency Ray Tracing with Neural Object Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) propagation modeling poses unique electromagnetic simulation challenges. While recent neural representations have shown success in visible spectrum rendering, the fundamentally different scales and physics of RF signals require novel modeling paradigms. In this paper, we introduce RFScape, a novel framework that bridges the gap between neural scene representation and RF propagation modeling. Our key insight is that complex RF-object interactions can be captured through object-centric neural representations while preserving the composability of traditional ray tracing. Unlike previous approaches that either rely on crude geometric approximations or require dense spatial sampling of entire scenes, RFScape learns per-object electromagnetic properties and enables flexible scene composition. Through extensive evaluation on real-world RF testbeds, we demonstrate that our approach achieves 13 dB improvement over conventional ray tracing and 5 dB over state-of-the-art neural baselines in modeling accuracy while requiring only sparse training samples.</description>

      <title>Miniature UAV Empowered Reconfigurable Energy Harvesting Holographic Surfaces in THz Cooperative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency (EE) of a cooperative network featuring a `miniature' unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that operates at terahertz (THz) frequencies, utilizing holographic surfaces to improve the network's performance. Unlike traditional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) that are typically used as passive relays to adjust signal reflections, this work introduces a novel concept: Energy harvesting (EH) using reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) mounted on the miniature UAV. In this system, a source node facilitates the simultaneous reception of information and energy signals by the UAV, with the harvested energy from the RHS being used by the UAV to transmit data to a specific destination. The EE optimization involves adjusting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power coefficients and the UAV's flight path, considering the peculiarities of the THz channel. The optimization problem is solved in two steps. Initially, the trajectory is refined using a successive convex approximation (SCA) method, followed by the adjustment of NOMA power coefficients through a quadratic transform technique. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulations, showing superior results when compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised \textit{Rel}ative \textit{Con}trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>MSEMG: Surface Electromyography Denoising with a Mamba-based Efficient Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings can be contaminated by electrocardiogram (ECG) signals when the monitored muscle is closed to the heart. Traditional signal-processing-based approaches, such as high-pass filtering and template subtraction, have been used to remove ECG interference but are often limited in their effectiveness. Recently, neural-network-based methods have shown greater promise for sEMG denoising, but they still struggle to balance both efficiency and effectiveness. In this study, we introduce MSEMG, a novel system that integrates the Mamba State Space Model with a convolutional neural network to serve as a lightweight sEMG denoising model. We evaluated MSEMG using sEMG data from the Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics database and ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. The results show that MSEMG outperforms existing methods, generating higher-quality sEMG signals with fewer parameters. The source code for MSEMG is available at https://github.com/tonyliu0910/MSEMG.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Spectrum Sharing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) of wireless systems is being deployed with the aim to provide many sets of wireless communication services, such as low data rates for a massive amount of devices, broadband, low latency, and industrial wireless access. Such an aim is even more complex in the next generation wireless systems (6G) where wireless connectivity is expected to serve any connected intelligent unit, such as software robots and humans interacting in the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, drones, trains, or smart sensors monitoring cities, buildings, and the environment. Because of the wireless devices will be orders of magnitude denser than in 5G cellular systems, and because of their complex quality of service requirements, the access to the wireless spectrum will have to be appropriately shared to avoid congestion, poor quality of service, or unsatisfactory communication delays. Spectrum sharing methods have been the objective of intense study through model-based approaches, such as optimization or game theories. However, these methods may fail when facing the complexity of the communication environments in 5G, 6G, and beyond. Recently, there has been significant interest in the application and development of data-driven methods, namely machine learning methods, to handle the complex operation of spectrum sharing. In this survey, we provide a complete overview of the state-of-theart of machine learning for spectrum sharing. First, we map the most prominent methods that we encounter in spectrum sharing. Then, we show how these machine learning methods are applied to the numerous dimensions and sub-problems of spectrum sharing, such as spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum access, and spectrum handoff. We also highlight several open questions and future trends.</description>

      <title>A Novel Design Method for Digital FIR/IIR Filters Based on the Shuffle Frog-Leaping Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of both FIR and IIR digital filters is a multi-variable optimization problem, where traditional algorithms fail to obtain optimal solutions. A modified Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) is here proposed for the design of FIR and IIR discrete-time filters as close as possible to the desired filter frequency response. This algorithm can be considered a type of memetic algorithm. In this paper, simulations prove the obtained filters outperform those designed using the traditional bilinear Z transform (BZT) method with elliptic approximation. Besides, results are close to, and even slightly better, than those reported in recent bio-inspired approaches using algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE) and regularized global optimization (RGA).</description>

      <title>Spectrum Efficiency and Processing Latency Trade-offs in Panel-Based LIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation wireless systems will face stringent new requirements, including ultra-low latency, high data rates and enhanced reliability. Large Intelligent Surfaces, is one proposed solution that has the potential to solve these high demands. The real-life deployment of such systems involves different design considerations with non-trivial trade-offs. This paper investigates the trade-off between spectral efficiency and processing latency, considering different antenna distribution schemes and detection algorithms. A latency model for the physical layer processing has been developed with realistic hardware parameters. The simulation results using an in-door environment show that distributing the antennas throughout the scenario improves the overall reliability, while the impact on the latency is limited when zero-forcing (ZF) detection is used. On the other hand, changing the detection algorithm to maximum-ratio combining (MRC) may reduce the latency significantly, even if a larger number of antennas are needed to achieve a similar spectrum efficiency as ZF detection.</description>

      <title>Signal-based online acceleration and strain data fusion using B-splines and Kalman filter for full-field dynamic displacement estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Displacement plays a crucial role in structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection of structural systems subjected to dynamic loads. However, due to the inconvenience associated with the direct measurement of displacement during dynamic loading and the high cost of displacement sensors, the use of displacement measurements often gets restricted. In recent years, indirect estimation of displacement from acceleration and strain data has gained popularity. Several researchers have developed data fusion techniques to estimate displacement from acceleration and strain data. However, existing data fusion techniques mostly rely on system properties like mode shapes or finite element models and require accurate knowledge about the system for successful implementation. Hence, they have the inherent limitation of their applicability being restricted to relatively simple structures where such information is easily available. In this article, B-spline basis functions have been used to formulate a Kalman filter-based algorithm for acceleration and strain data fusion using only elementary information about the system, such as the geometry and boundary conditions, which is the major advantage of this method. Also, the proposed algorithm enables us to monitor the full-field displacement of the system online with only a limited number of sensors. The method has been validated on a numerically generated dataset from the finite element model of a tapered beam subjected to dynamic excitation. Later, the proposed data fusion technique was applied to an experimental benchmark test of a wind turbine blade under dynamic load to estimate the displacement time history. In both cases, the reconstructed displacement from strain and acceleration was found to match well with the response from the FE model.</description>

      <title>Dual-functional microwave photonic system for concurrent radar and secure communication via radar signal masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating functions such as radar and communication into a single system is of great significance for the miniaturization and functional integration of future electronic warfare and 6G systems. Here, we show a dual-functional microwave photonic system for concurrent radar and secure communication. The scheme utilizes microwave photonic frequency multiplying and frequency conversion techniques to shift both the intermediate frequency radar and communication signals to the same frequency band, enabling radar and communication operations at the same time and frequency. The high-power radar signal is also used to mask the communication signal, increasing the difficulty of signal interception and thus enhancing security. By employing de-chirping at the radar receiver and self-interference cancelation at the communication receiver, the radar function can be implemented and the communication signal can also be correctly demodulated after removing the radar masking. An experiment is performed. A 0.3-GHz bandwidth linearly frequency-modulated signal is quadrupled and superimposed with two up-converted 0.5-Gbaud orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signals. A communication data rate of 2 Gbit/s, a radar ranging measurement error of less than $\pm$ 0.3 cm, and a radar inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging resolution of 12.5$\times$10.2 cm are achieved.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Wideband Beamforming for RIS Based on Fresnel Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the challenges of high path loss and easy signal blockage in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communication systems. With the increase of RIS aperture and system bandwidth, the near-field beam split effect emerges, which causes beams at different frequencies to focus on distinct physical locations, leading to a significant gain loss of beamforming. To address this problem, we leverage the property of Fresnel zone that the beam split disappears for RIS elements along a single Fresnel zone and propose beamforming design on the two dimensions of along and across the Fresnel zones. The phase shift of RIS elements along the same Fresnel zone are designed aligned, so that the signal reflected by these element can add up in-phase at the receiver regardless of the frequency. Then the expression of equivalent channel is simplified to the Fourier transform of reflective intensity across Fresnel zones modulated by the designed phase. Based on this relationship, we prove that the uniformly distributed in-band gain with aligned phase along the Fresnel zone leads to the upper bound of achievable rate. Finally, we design phase shifts of RIS to approach this upper bound by adopting the stationary phase method as well as the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed Fresnel zone-based method in mitigating the near-field beam split effect.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Aerial Platforms for Downlink Communications in Sparse Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although a significant number satellites are deemed essential for facilitating diverse applications of satellite networks, aerial platforms are emerging as excellent alternatives for enabling reliable communications with fewer satellites. In scenarios with sparse satellite networks, aerial platforms participate in downlink communications, serving effectively as relays and providing comparable or even superior coverage compared to a large number of satellites. This paper explores the role of aerial platforms in assisting downlink communications, emphasizing their potential as an alternative to dense satellite networks. Firstly, we account for the space-time interconnected movement of satellites in orbits by establishing a stochastic geometry framework based on an isotropic satellite Cox point process. Using this model, we evaluate space-and-time performance metrics such as the number of orbits, the number of communicable satellites, and the connectivity probability, primarily assessing the geometric impact of aerial platforms. Subsequently, we analyze signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) coverage probability, end-to-end throughput, and association delay. Through examination of these performance metrics, we explicitly demonstrate how aerial platforms enhance downlink communications by improving various key network performance metrics that would have been achieved only by many satellites, thereby assessing their potential as an excellent alternative to dense satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Holographic Surface: A New Paradigm for Ultra-Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolving from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in current 5G communications, ultra-massive MIMO emerges as a seminal technology for fulfilling more stringent requirements of future 6G communications. However, widely-utilized phased arrays relying on active components make the implementation of ultra-massive MIMO in practice increasingly prohibitive from both cost and power consumption perspectives. In contrast, the development of reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) provides a new paradigm to solve the above issue without the need of costly hardware components. By leveraging the holographic principle, the RHS serves as an ultra-thin and lightweight surface antenna integrated with the transceiver, which is a promising alternative to phased arrays for realizing ultra-massive MIMO. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the RHS, especially the RHS-aided communication and sensing. We first describe the basic concepts of RHS, and introduce its working principle and unique practical constraints. Moreover, we show how to utilize the RHS to achieve cost-efficient and high-performance wireless communication and sensing, and introduce the key technologies. In particular, we present the implementation of RHS with a wireless communication prototype, and report the experimental measurement results based on it. Finally, we outline some open challenges and potential future directions in this area.</description>

      <title>Zero-Forget Preservation of Semantic Communication Alignment in Distributed AI Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future communication networks are expected to connect massive distributed artificial intelligence (AI). Exploiting aligned priori knowledge of AI pairs, it is promising to convert high-dimensional data transmission into highly-compressed semantic communications (SC). However, to accommodate the local data distribution and user preferences, AIs generally adapt to different domains, which fundamentally distorts the SC alignment. In this paper, we propose a zero-forget domain adaptation (ZFDA) framework to preserve SC alignment. To prevent the DA from changing substantial neural parameters of AI, we design sparse additive modifications (SAM) to the parameters, which can be efficiently stored and switched-off to restore the SC alignment. To optimize the SAM, we decouple it into tractable continuous variables and a binary mask, and then handle the binary mask by a score-based optimization. Experimental evaluations on a SC system for image transmissions validate that the proposed framework perfectly preserves the SC alignment with almost no loss of DA performance, even improved in some cases, at a cost of less than 1% of additional memory.</description>

      <title>Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide critical insights for applications in disease diagnosis and healthcare. However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</description>

      <title>A PDD-Inspired Channel Estimation Scheme in NOMA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 5G networks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) provides a number of benefits by providing uneven power distribution to multiple users at once. On the other hand, effective power allocation, successful successive interference cancellation (SIC), and user fairness all depend on precise channel state information (CSI). Because of dynamic channels, imperfect models, and feedback overhead, CSI prediction in NOMA is difficult. Our aim is to propose a CSI prediction technique based on an ML model that accounts for partially decoded data (PDD), a byproduct of the SIC process. Our proposed technique has been shown to be efficient in handover failure (HOF) prediction and reducing pilot overhead, which is particularly important in 5G. We have shown how machine learning (ML) models may be used to forecast CSI in NOMA handover.</description>

      <title>Emerging Technologies in Intelligent Metasurfaces: Shaping the Future of Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent metasurfaces have demonstrated great promise in revolutionizing wireless communications. One notable example is the two-dimensional (2D) programmable metasurface, which is also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate the wireless propagation environment to enhance network coverage. More recently, three-dimensional (3D) stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have been developed to substantially improve signal processing efficiency by directly processing analog electromagnetic signals in the wave domain. Another exciting breakthrough is the flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM), which possesses the ability to morph its 3D surface shape in response to dynamic wireless channels and thus achieve diversity gain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging intelligent metasurface technologies. We commence by examining recent experiments of RIS and exploring its applications from four perspectives. Furthermore, we delve into the fundamental principles underlying SIM, discussing relevant prototypes as well as their applications. Numerical results are also provided to illustrate the potential of SIM for analog signal processing. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art of FIM technology, discussing its impact on wireless communications and identifying the key challenges of integrating FIMs into wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Spatial-Temporal Channel Statistics from Measurement Data at D Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) (30-300 GHz) and D band (110-170 GHz) frequencies are poised to play a pivotal role in the advancement of sixth-generation (6G) systems and beyond with increased demand for greater bandwidth and capacity. This paper focuses on deriving a generalized channel impulse response for mmWave communications, considering both outdoor and indoor locations for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The analysis is based on statistical insights obtained from measurements conducted at distinct locations with a center frequency of 142 GHz, examining parameters such as path gain, delay, number of paths (NoP), and angle distributions. Whereas different distributions serve as candidate models for the gain of LOS communications, only specific distributions accurately describe the NLOS gain, LOS and NLOS delay, LOS and NLOS NoP, and LOS and NLOS angular distributions. The channel is modeled based on geometry-based stochastic channel modeling (GBSM) with parameters derived from the statistical analysis. The maximum excess delay is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed model against empirical data.</description>

      <title>Gaussian multi-target filtering with target dynamics driven by a stochastic differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes multi-target filtering algorithms in which target dynamics are given in continuous time and measurements are obtained at discrete time instants. In particular, targets appear according to a Poisson point process (PPP) in time with a given Gaussian spatial distribution, targets move according to a general time-invariant linear stochastic differential equation, and the life span of each target is modelled with an exponential distribution. For this multi-target dynamic model, we derive the distribution of the set of new born targets and calculate closed-form expressions for the best fitting mean and covariance of each target at its time of birth by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence via moment matching. This yields a novel Gaussian continuous-discrete Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter, and its approximations based on Poisson multi-Bernoulli and probability hypothesis density filtering. These continuous-discrete multi-target filters are also extended to target dynamics driven by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Scaling Transformers for Low-Bitrate High-Quality Speech Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tokenization of speech with neural audio codec models is a vital part of modern AI pipelines for the generation or understanding of speech, alone or in a multimodal context. Traditionally such tokenization models have concentrated on low parameter-count architectures using only components with strong inductive biases. In this work we show that by scaling a transformer architecture with large parameter count to this problem, and applying a flexible Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) based bottleneck, it is possible to reach state-of-the-art speech quality at extremely low bit-rates of $400$ or $700$ bits-per-second. The trained models strongly out-perform existing baselines in both objective and subjective tests.</description>

      <title>A Visual-inertial Localization Algorithm using Opportunistic Visual Beacons and Dead-Reckoning for GNSS-Denied Large-scale Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of smart cities, the demand for continuous pedestrian navigation in large-scale urban environments has significantly increased. While global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) provide low-cost and reliable positioning services, they are often hindered in complex urban canyon environments. Thus, exploring opportunistic signals for positioning in urban areas has become a key solution. Augmented reality (AR) allows pedestrians to acquire real-time visual information. Accordingly, we propose a low-cost visual-inertial positioning solution. This method comprises a lightweight multi-scale group convolution (MSGC)-based visual place recognition (VPR) neural network, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm, and a visual/inertial fusion approach based on a Kalman filter with gross error suppression. The VPR serves as a conditional observation to the Kalman filter, effectively correcting the errors accumulated through the PDR method. This enables the entire algorithm to ensure the reliability of long-term positioning in GNSS-denied areas. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains stable positioning during large-scale movements. Compared to the lightweight MobileNetV3-based VPR method, our proposed VPR solution improves Recall@1 by at least 3\% on two public datasets while reducing the number of parameters by 63.37\%. It also achieves performance that is comparable to the VGG16-based method. The VPR-PDR algorithm improves localization accuracy by more than 40\% compared to the original PDR.</description>

      <title>Micro Hand Gesture Recognition System Using Ultrasonic Active Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:1712.00216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a micro hand gesture recognition system and methods using ultrasonic active sensing. This system uses micro dynamic hand gestures for recognition to achieve human-computer interaction (HCI). The implemented system, called hand-ultrasonic gesture (HUG), consists of ultrasonic active sensing, pulsed radar signal processing, and time-sequence pattern recognition by machine learning. We adopt lower frequency (300 kHz) ultrasonic active sensing to obtain high resolution range-Doppler image features. Using high quality sequential range-Doppler features, we propose a state-transition-based hidden Markov model for gesture recognition. This method achieves a recognition accuracy of nearly 90\% by using symbolized range-Doppler features and significantly reduces the computational complexity and power consumption. Furthermore, to achieve higher classification accuracy, we utilize an end-to-end neural network model and obtain a recognition accuracy of 96.32\%. In addition to offline analysis, a real-time prototype is released to verify our method's potential for application in the real world.</description>

      <title>Reducing Channel Estimation and Feedback Overhead in IRS-Aided Downlink System: A Quantize-then-Estimate Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is essential for the base station (BS) to fully reap the beamforming gain in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided downlink communication systems. Recently, [1] revealed a strong correlation in different users' cascaded channels stemming from their common BS-IRS channel component, and leveraged such a correlation to significantly reduce the pilot transmission overhead in IRS-aided uplink communication. In this paper, we aim to exploit the above channel property to reduce the overhead for both pilot and feedback transmission in IRS-aided downlink communication. Note that in the downlink, the distributed users merely receive the pilot signals containing their own CSI and cannot leverage the correlation in different users' channels, which is in sharp contrast to the uplink counterpart considered in [1]. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel ``quantize-then-estimate'' protocol in frequency division duplex (FDD) IRS-aided downlink communication. Specifically, the users quantize and feed back their received pilot signals, instead of the estimated channels, to the BS. After de-quantizing the pilot signals received by all the users, the BS estimates all the cascaded channels by leveraging their correlation, similar to the uplink scenario. Under this protocol, we manage to propose efficient user-side quantization and BS-side channel estimation methods. Moreover, we analytically quantify the pilot and feedback transmission overhead to reveal the significant performance gain of our proposed scheme over the conventional ``estimate-then-quantize'' scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal Dual-Polarized Planar Arrays for Massive Capacity Over Point-to-Point MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless networks must provide ever higher data rates. The available bandwidth increases roughly linearly as we increase the carrier frequency, but the range shrinks drastically. This paper explores if we can instead reach massive capacities using spatial multiplexing over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, therank of the MIMO channel matrix depends on the polarization and antenna arrangement. We optimize the rank and condition number by identifying the optimal antenna spacing in dual-polarized planar antenna arrays with imperfect isolation. The result is sparely spaced antenna arrays that exploit radiative near-field properties. We further optimize the array geometry for minimum aperture length and aperture area, which leads to different configurations. Moreover, we prove analytically that for fixed-sized arrays, the MIMO rank grows quadratically with the carrier frequency in LOS scenarios, if the antennas are appropriately designed. Hence, MIMO technology contributes more to the capacity growth than the bandwidth. The numerical results show that massive data rates, far beyond 1 Tbps, can be reached both over fixed point-to-point links. It is also possible for a large base station to serve a practically-sized mobile device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of 3D high-resolution imaging in automotive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) side-looking radar using a 1D array is considered. The concept of motion-enhanced snapshots is introduced for generating larger apertures in the azimuth dimension. For the first time, 3D imaging capabilities can be achieved with high angular resolution using a 1D MIMO antenna array, which can alleviate the requirement for large radar systems in autonomous vehicles. The robustness to variations in the vehicle's movement trajectory is also considered and addressed with relevant compensations in the steering vector. The available degrees of freedom as well as the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) are shown to increase with the proposed method compared to conventional imaging approaches. The performance of the algorithm has been studied in simulations, and validated with experimental data collected in a realistic driving scenario.</description>

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence Satellite Telecommunications Testbed (AISTT), part of the ESA project SPAICE, is focused on the transformation of the satellite payload by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies over available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) AI-capable chips for onboard processing. The objectives include validating artificial intelligence-driven SATCOM scenarios such as interference detection, spectrum sharing, radio resource management, decoding, and beamforming. The study highlights hardware selection and payload architecture. Preliminary results show that ML models significantly improve signal quality, spectral efficiency, and throughput compared to conventional payload. Moreover, the testbed aims to evaluate the performance and the use of AI-capable COTS chips in onboard SATCOM contexts.</description>

      <title>The Roles of Spatial Frequencies and Degrees-of-Freedom in Near-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wireless technology begins to utilize physically larger arrays and/or higher frequencies, the transmitter and receiver will reside in each other's radiative near field. This fact gives rise to unusual propagation phenomena such as spherical wavefronts and beamfocusing, creating the impression that new spatial dimensions -- called degrees-of-freedom (DoF) -- can be exploited in the near field. However, this is a fallacy because the theoretically maximum DoF are already achievable in the far field. This paper sheds light on these issues by providing a tutorial on spatial frequencies, which are the fundamental components of wireless channels, and by explaining their role in characterizing the DoF in the near and far fields. In particular, we demonstrate how a single propagation path utilizes one spatial frequency in the far field and an interval of spatial frequencies in the near field. We explain how the array geometry determines the number of distinguishable spatial frequency bins and, thereby, the spatial DoF. We also describe how to model near-field multipath channels and their spatial correlation matrices. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Differential Evolution-Based End-Fire Realized Gain Optimization of Active and Parasitic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for boosting the realized gain in enhanced directivity arrays with both active and parasitic dipoles as radiating elements. The optimization process involves two main objectives: maximizing the end-fire gain and minimizing the reflection coefficient to ensure high realized gain. In the first step, the current excitation vector of the fully driven array is selected to maximize the end-fire gain. Then, all but one of the dipoles are reactively loaded according to their input impedance. Following that, the optimization focuses on the inter-element distance, computing the one that offers a favorable balance between the gain and the total efficiency. This multi-objective optimization leverages the differential evolution (DE) algorithm and utilizes a simple wire dipole as the unit element. Full-wave simulations further confirm the accuracy of our theoretical results. Our two- and three-element parasitic arrays achieve realized gain comparable to state-of-the-art designs, without relying on intricate unit elements or resource-intensive simulations. Moreover, our four- and five-element parasitic arrays deliver the highest realized gain values reported in the literature. The simplicity of our approach is validated by significant time savings, with theoretical models completing optimizations much faster than full-wave simulations. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the proposed optimization algorithm, demonstrating that the optimized design parameters remain effective even under small deviations in loads and element positions. Finally, the proposed parasitic arrays are well-suited for base station antennas due to their compact design, reduced power consumption, and simplified hardware requirements, making them ideal for modern communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitous across various healthcare domains, such as cardiac arrhythmia detection and sleep monitoring, making ECG analysis critically essential. Traditional deep learning models for ECG are task-specific, with a narrow scope of functionality and limited generalization capabilities. Recently, foundation models (FMs), also known as large pre-training models, have fundamentally reshaped the scheme of model design and representation learning, enhancing the performance across a variety of downstream tasks. This success has drawn interest in the exploration of FMs to address ECG-based medical challenges concurrently. This survey provides a timely, comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for large-scale ECG-FMs. First, we offer a brief background introduction to FMs. Then, we discuss the model architectures, pre-training methods, and adaptation approaches of ECG-FMs from a methodology perspective. Despite the promising opportunities of ECG-FMs, we also outline the challenges and potential future directions. Overall, this survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with insights into the research of ECG-FMs on theoretical underpinnings, domain-specific applications, and avenues for future exploration.</description>

      <title>SPDIM: Source-Free Unsupervised Conditional and Label Shift Adaptation in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) introduces distribution shifts across domains (e.g., days and subjects), posing a significant challenge to EEG-based neurotechnology generalization. Without labeled calibration data for target domains, the problem is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) problem. For scenarios with constant label distribution, Riemannian geometry-aware statistical alignment frameworks on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold are considered state-of-the-art. However, many practical scenarios, including EEG-based sleep staging, exhibit label shifts. Here, we propose a geometric deep learning framework for SFUDA problems under specific distribution shifts, including label shifts. We introduce a novel, realistic generative model and show that prior Riemannian statistical alignment methods on the SPD manifold can compensate for specific marginal and conditional distribution shifts but hurt generalization under label shifts. As a remedy, we propose a parameter-efficient manifold optimization strategy termed SPDIM. SPDIM uses the information maximization principle to learn a single SPD-manifold-constrained parameter per target domain. In simulations, we demonstrate that SPDIM can compensate for the shifts under our generative model. Moreover, using public EEG-based brain-computer interface and sleep staging datasets, we show that SPDIM outperforms prior approaches.</description>

      <title>A CSI Feedback Framework based on Transmitting the Important Values and Generating the Others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback frameworks in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has significantly improved reconstruction accuracy. However, the limited generalization of widely adopted autoencoder-based networks for CSI feedback challenges consistent performance under dynamic wireless channel conditions and varying communication overhead constraints. To enhance the robustness of DL-based CSI feedback across diverse channel scenarios, we propose a novel framework, ITUG, where the user equipment (UE) transmits only a selected portion of critical values in the CSI matrix, while a generative model deployed at the BS reconstructs the remaining values. Specifically, we introduce a scoring algorithm to identify important values based on amplitude and contrast, an encoding algorithm to convert these values into a bit stream for transmission using adaptive bit length and a modified Huffman codebook, and a Transformer-based generative network named TPMVNet to recover the untransmitted values based on the received important values. Experimental results demonstrate that the ITUG framework, equipped with a single TPMVNet, achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to several high-performance autoencoder models across various channel conditions.</description>

      <title>mmWave Radar for Sit-to-Stand Analysis: A Comparative Study with Wearables and Kinect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology. The goal is to develop a non-contact sensing, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational method for healthcare applications, including fall risk assessment. We used a 60GHz mmWave radar system to collect radar point cloud data, capturing STS motions from 45 participants. By employing a deep learning pose estimation model, we learned the human skeleton from Kinect built-in body tracking and applied Inverse Kinematics (IK) to calculate joint angles, segment STS motions, and extract commonly used features in fall risk assessment. Radar extracted features were then compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of mmWave radar in capturing general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk). Additionally, the study highlights the advantages and disadvantages of individual sensors and suggests the potential of integrated sensor technologies to improve the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research settings.</description>

      <title>Robust Stochastically-Descending Unrolled Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep unrolling, or unfolding, is an emerging learning-to-optimize method that unrolls a truncated iterative algorithm in the layers of a trainable neural network. However, the convergence guarantees and generalizability of the unrolled networks are still open theoretical problems. To tackle these problems, we provide deep unrolled architectures with a stochastic descent nature by imposing descending constraints during training. The descending constraints are forced layer by layer to ensure that each unrolled layer takes, on average, a descent step toward the optimum during training. We theoretically prove that the sequence constructed by the outputs of the unrolled layers is then guaranteed to converge for unseen problems, assuming no distribution shift between training and test problems. We also show that standard unrolling is brittle to perturbations, and our imposed constraints provide the unrolled networks with robustness to additive noise and perturbations. We numerically assess unrolled architectures trained under the proposed constraints in two different applications, including the sparse coding using learnable iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (LISTA) and image inpainting using proximal generative flow (GLOW-Prox), and demonstrate the performance and robustness benefits of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Semantic Entropy Can Simultaneously Benefit Transmission Efficiency and Channel Security of Wireless Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proliferated deep learning-based semantic communications (DLSC) focus on how transmitted symbols efficiently convey a desired meaning to the destination. However, the sensitivity of neural models and the openness of wireless channels cause the DLSC system to be extremely fragile to various malicious attacks. This inspires us to ask a question: "Can we further exploit the advantages of transmission efficiency in wireless semantic communications while also alleviating its security disadvantages?". Keeping this in mind, we propose SemEntropy, a novel method that answers the above question by exploring the semantics of data for both adaptive transmission and physical layer encryption. Specifically, we first introduce semantic entropy, which indicates the expectation of various semantic scores regarding the transmission goal of the DLSC. Equipped with such semantic entropy, we can dynamically assign informative semantics to Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers with better channel conditions in a fine-grained manner. We also use the entropy to guide semantic key generation to safeguard communications over open wireless channels. By doing so, both transmission efficiency and channel security can be simultaneously improved. Extensive experiments over various benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed SemEntropy. We discuss the reason why our proposed method benefits secure transmission of DLSC, and also give some interesting findings, e.g., SemEntropy can keep the semantic accuracy remain 95% with 60% less transmission.</description>

      <title>Networked Collaborative Sensing using Multi-domain Measurements: Architectures, Performance Limits and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a promising 6G technology, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) gains growing interest. ISAC provides integration gain via sharing spectrum, hardware, and software. However, concerns exist regarding its sensing performance when compared to the dedicated radar. To address this issue, the advantages of widely deployed networks should be utilized. This paper proposes networked collaborative sensing (NCS) using multi-domain measurements (MM), including range, Doppler, and two-dimension angles. For the NCS-MM architecture, this paper proposes a novel multi-domain decoupling model and a novel guard band-based protocol. The proposed model simplifies multi-domain derivations and algorithm designs, and the proposed protocol conserves resources and mitigates NCS interference. In terms of performance limits, this paper derives the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of position and velocity estimations in NCS-MM. An accumulated single-dimension channel model is proposed, which is proven to be equivalent to that of the multi-dimension model. The algorithms of both MM estimation and fusion are proposed. An arbitrary-dimension Newtonized orthogonal matched pursuit (AD-NOMP) is proposed to accurately estimate grid-less MM. The degree-of-freedom (DoF) of MM is analyzed, and a novel DoF-based two-stage weighted least squares (TSWLS) is proposed to reduce complexity without DoF loss. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms approach their performance limits.</description>

      <title>SemantiCodec: An Ultra Low Bitrate Semantic Audio Codec for General Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modelling techniques to audio data. However, traditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such as speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language modelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel codec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second across diverse audio types, including speech, general sound, and music, without compromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a semantic encoder using a self-supervised pre-trained Audio Masked Autoencoder (AudioMAE), discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and an acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic encoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based decoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25, 50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31 kbps and 1.40 kbps. Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction quality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly richer semantic information than all evaluated state-of-the-art audio codecs, even at significantly lower bitrates. Our code and demos are available at https://haoheliu.github.io/SemantiCodec/.</description>

      <title>Revisiting XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: When Dual-Wideband Effects Meet Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) and operation at higher frequency bands in wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems introduce significant near-field effects, such as spherical wavefront propagation and spatially non-stationary (SnS) properties. Combined with dual-wideband impacts, these effects fundamentally reshape the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, making existing sparsity-based channel estimation methods inadequate. To address these challenges, this paper revisits the channel estimation problem for wideband XL-MIMO systems, considering dual-wideband effects, spherical wavefront, and SnS properties. By leveraging the spatial-chirp property of near-field array responses, we quantitatively characterize the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, revealing global block sparsity and local common-delay sparsity. Building on this structured sparsity, we formulate the wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-based Bayesian inference task and propose a novel column-wise hierarchical prior model to effectively capture the sparsity characteristics. To enable efficient channel reconstruction, we develop an MMV-based variational message passing (MMV-VMP) algorithm, tailored to the complex factor graph induced by the hierarchical prior. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its convergence and superior performance compared to existing methods, thus establishing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation under complex near-field conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open source simulator for packet routing in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations (LSatCs) considering the dynamic system uncertainties. The simulator, implemented in Python, supports traditional Dijkstra's based routing as well as more advanced learning solutions, specifically Q-Routing and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) from our previous work. It uses an event-based approach with the SimPy module to accurately simulate packet creation, routing and queuing, providing real-time tracking of queues and latency. The simulator is highly configurable, allowing adjustments in routing policies, traffic, ground and space layer topologies, communication parameters, and learning hyperparameters. Key features include the ability to visualize system motion and track packet paths. Results highlight significant improvements in end-to-end (E2E) latency using Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based routing policies compared to traditional methods. The source code, the documentation and a Jupyter notebook with post-processing results and analysis are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Learning to Embed Distributions via Maximum Kernel Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction datasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be optimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data assessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of instruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data evaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the selection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on existing literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction tuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into quality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified, fine-grained taxonomy is structured. For each category, representative methods are elaborated to describe the landscape of relevant research. In addition, comparison between the latest methods is conducted on their officially reported results to provide in-depth discussions on their limitations. Finally, we summarize the open challenges and propose the promosing avenues for future studies.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Parsimonious Dynamic Mode Decomposition (parsDMD), a novel algorithm designed to automatically select an optimally sparse subset of dynamic modes for both spatiotemporal and purely temporal data. By incorporating time-delay embedding and leveraging Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), parsDMD ensures robustness against noise and effectively handles complex, nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm is validated on a diverse range of datasets, including standing wave signals, identifying hidden dynamics, fluid dynamics simulations (flow past a cylinder and transonic buffet), and atmospheric sea-surface temperature (SST) data. ParsDMD addresses a significant limitation of the traditional sparsity-promoting DMD (spDMD), which requires manual tuning of sparsity parameters through a rigorous trial-and-error process to balance between single-mode and all-mode solutions. In contrast, parsDMD autonomously determines the optimally sparse subset of modes without user intervention, while maintaining minimal computational complexity. Comparative analyses demonstrate that parsDMD consistently outperforms spDMD by providing more accurate mode identification and effective reconstruction in noisy environments. These advantages render parsDMD an effective tool for real-time diagnostics, forecasting, and reduced-order model construction across various disciplines.</description>
