      <title>Accelerating Molecular H$_2^+$ Beam in AGS and RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the recent success of acceleration molecular H$_2^+$ beam (from EBIS) in Booster to 1.0 GeV/u kinetic energy, we propose to carry out tests to accelerate H$_2^+$ beam in AGS (up to 12 GeV/u) and to RHIC (up to 100 GeV/u). In this Note, we address the main effects that might hamper H$_2^+$ beam acceleration, outline the impacts and benefits of high energy H$_2^+$ beam to BNL.</description>

      <title>Design and modeling of a liquid-lead dump concept for beamstrahlung radiation absorption in the CERN Future Circular e$^+$e$^-$ Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-positron Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) being developed at CERN will generate intense beamstrahlung radiation, thus requiring photon absorbers downstream of the interaction points. This work presents the conceptual design of flowing-liquid-lead absorbers capable of dissipating around 370 kW of photon power, with a mean photon energy of 62 MeV. Two configurations are investigated: an inclined-flow geometry, developed to increase the photon interaction length to maximize absorption, and a compact upstream slope with an additional pool, in which a free-surface lead flow intercepts the power peak before a downstream pool dissipates the remaining load. Photon-matter interactions are modeled using Monte Carlo simulations in fluka, while conjugate heat-transfer and free-surface dynamics are analyzed through computational-fluid-dynamics simulations using ansys fluent. Design refinements are introduced based on the simulated thermal and hydraulic performance and to mitigate secondary effects such as photon backscattering. Both configurations demonstrate stable operation within the 300 kg/s flow limit and maintain liquid-lead and structural temperatures within the operational range of 450--500 $^{\circ}$C. The results establish circulating liquid lead as a feasible and thermally robust baseline technology for beamstrahlung absorption in FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Detection of high-frequency gravitational waves using SRF cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, apart from some isolated R&amp;D efforts, there are no gravitational wave (GW) experiments, yet which explore a large part of the vast frequency range above the LIGO/Virgo band. It is planned to establish an experiment at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and at the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) to search for high-frequency GWs in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 100 MHz. The basic idea is to use superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities to detect tiny harmonic deformations induced by GWs which change the boundary conditions of the oscillating electromagnetic field. This paper summarizes the challenging environmental boundary requirements, and the R&amp;D to operate a cavity using a low level RF (LLRF) system which pushes beyond state-of-the-art accuracy and resolutions and a seismic noise mitigated cryostat at 1.8 K. The focus of this paper is the warm and cold commissioning of a prototype cavity, built 20 years ago during the MAGO collaboration, and its first measurement in our collaborative research project.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the beam-induced depolarization of the HJET target at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Polarized Atomic Hydrogen Gas Jet Target (HJET) has played a central role in the absolute calibration of proton beam polarization at RHIC and is foreseen as a key element of the hadron polarimetry program at the future Electron--Ion Collider (EIC). The substantially higher beam current, reduced bunch spacing, and shorter bunch length planned for EIC operation motivate a careful reassessment of possible beam-induced depolarization of the jet target. In this paper, the depolarization of ground-state hydrogen atoms caused by the time-dependent magnetic field of the circulating polarized proton beam is quantitatively evaluated. The hydrogen atom is treated as a four-level hyperfine system in a holding magnetic field, and transitions driven by harmonic components of the bunch-induced magnetic field are analyzed using time-dependent quantum-mechanical evolution along atomic trajectories. Numerical tracking of hydrogen atoms through the beam region is performed using nominal EIC beam parameters. It is shown that, for a holding field of $120\,\mathrm{mT}$ (as used at RHIC), the resulting depolarization of the jet target at the EIC is negligibly small, $\lesssim 0.01\%$, and well below the level relevant for EIC polarization accuracy requirements. The stability of this result with respect to plausible variations of the EIC proton beam parameters is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive Beam Monitoring via Secondary Radiation Detection with Ce-Doped Silica Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-destructive beam diagnostics are essential for low-energy medical cyclotrons, where even thin interceptive devices can severely degrade beam quality. We investigate an external fiber monitor (EFM) based on Ce-doped silica scintillating fibers that detects secondary radiation generated at existing beamline components of the 18 MeV Bern Medical Cyclotron beam transfer line (BTL). Three use cases were studied: (i) beam intensity monitoring around an electrically isolated, water-cooled beam dump; (ii) beam-loss monitoring around a 10 mm collimator under varying the beam focusing; and (iii) by steering a 6.5 mm $\times$ 6.5 mm beam spot on a beam dump. For case (i), the summed EFM signal exhibits a linear dependence on the current on target over nearly three orders of magnitude. In case (ii), a normalized EFM-based beam-loss proxy scales monotonically with an electrical loss proxy across several focusing settings. Furthermore, opposing-fiber signal ratios provide decoupled, monotonic sensitivity to horizontal and vertical beam displacements.</description>

      <title>Physical Thickness Characterization of the FRIB Production Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FRIB heavy-ion accelerator, commissioned in 2022, is a leading facility
  for producing rare isotope beams (RIBs) and exploring nuclei beyond the limits of stability.
  These RIBs are produced via reactions between stable primary beams and a graphite target.
  Approximately 20-40 \% of the primary beam power is deposited in the target,
  requiring efficient thermal dissipation.
  Currently, FRIB operates with a primary beam power of up to 20 kW. To enhance thermal dissipation efficiency,
  a single-slice rotating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is employed.
  The effective target region is a 1 cm-wide outer rim of the graphite disc.
  To achieve high RIB production rates, the areal thickness variation must be constrained within 2 \%.
  This paper presents physical thickness characterizations of FRIB production targets with various nominal thicknesses,
  measured using a custom-built non-contact thickness measurement apparatus.</description>

      <title>Topological aspects of zero modes in cavity resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the zero modes of electromagnetic fields in a cavity resonator and the cavity's topological characteristics. We show that the dimension of the electromagnetic zero-mode space coincides with the dimension of the corresponding homology group of the cavity. Moreover, we prove that the alternating sum of the dimensions of the electromagnetic zero-mode spaces is closely related to the Euler characteristic of the cavity boundary, and hence to the integral of the curvature.</description>

      <title>A note on thermal effects in non-linear models for plasma-based acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a non-negligible background temperature on relativistic plasma wake-fields generated when a beam of charged particles passes through a neutral plasma at rest. We focus on the blowout regime, wherein the plasma response is highly non-linear: plasma electrons are radially blown out and expelled away from the propagation axis of the beam particles, creating a region (bubble) of ions without electrons. Our study builds upon earlier investigations for non-linear models of plasma wakefields developed in the limit of zero background temperature (Lu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 165002 (2006)). In the presence of a non-zero background temperature, we characterize the model and focus on its predictions for the bubble size and the electromagnetic fields inside the bubble. Model predictions are studied in combination with PIC simulations.</description>
