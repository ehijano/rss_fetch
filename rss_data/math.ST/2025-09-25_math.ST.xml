      <title>Distinguishability of causal structures under latent confounding and selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical relationships in observed data can arise for several different reasons: the observed variables may be causally related, they may share a latent common cause, or there may be selection bias. Each of these scenarios can be modelled using different causal graphs. Not all such causal graphs, however, can be distinguished by experimental data. In this paper, we formulate the equivalence class of causal graphs as a novel graphical structure, the selected-marginalized directed graph (smDG). That is, we show that two directed acyclic graphs with latent and selected vertices have the same smDG if and only if they are indistinguishable, even when allowing for arbitrary interventions on the observed variables. As a substitute for the more familiar d-separation criterion for DAGs, we provide an analogous sound and complete separation criterion in smDGs for conditional independence relative to passive observations. Finally, we provide a series of sufficient conditions under which two causal structures are indistinguishable when there is only access to passive observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new high-dimensional statistical learning model which can take advantage of structured correlation in data even in the presence of randomness. We completely characterize learnability in this model in terms of VCN${}_{k,k}$-dimension (essentially $k$-dependence from Shelah's classification theory). This model suggests a theoretical explanation for the success of certain algorithms in the 2006~Netflix Prize competition.</description>

      <title>A Gapped Scale-Sensitive Dimension and Lower Bounds for Offset Rademacher Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gapped scale-sensitive dimensions of a function class in both sequential and non-sequential settings. We demonstrate that covering numbers for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped dimensions, generalizing the results of \cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of convergence in statistical and online learning.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic independence in higher dimensions and its implications on risk management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of extremes, the presence of asymptotic independence signifies that extreme events across multiple variables are probably less likely to occur together. Although well-understood in a bivariate context, the concept remains relatively unexplored when addressing the nuances of the joint occurrence of extremes in higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose a notion of mutual asymptotic independence to capture the behavior of joint extremes in dimensions larger than two and contrast it with the classical notion of (pairwise) asymptotic independence. Additionally, we define k-wise asymptotic independence, which captures the tail dependence between pairwise and mutual asymptotic independence. The concepts are compared using examples of Archimedean, Gaussian and Marshall-Olkin copulas, among others. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new notions of asymptotic independence on assessing the risk of complex systems under distributional ambiguity.</description>

      <title>The Aldous$\unicode{x2013}$Hoover Theorem in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Aldous-Hoover Theorem concerns an infinite matrix of random variables whose distribution is invariant under finite permutations of rows and columns. It states that, up to equality in distribution, each random variable in the matrix can be expressed as a function only depending on four key variables: one common to the entire matrix, one that encodes information about its row, one that encodes information about its column, and a fourth one specific to the matrix entry.
  We state and prove the theorem within a category-theoretic approach to probability, namely the theory of Markov categories. This makes the proof more transparent and intuitive when compared to measure-theoretic ones. A key role is played by a newly identified categorical property, the Cauchy--Schwarz axiom, which also facilitates a new synthetic de Finetti Theorem.
  We further provide a variant of our proof using the ordered Markov property and the d-separation criterion, both generalized from Bayesian networks to Markov categories. We expect that this approach will facilitate a systematic development of more complex results in the future, such as categorical approaches to hierarchical exchangeability.</description>

      <title>Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.</description>

      <title>Rosenthal-type inequalities for linear statistics of Markov chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish novel concentration inequalities for additive functionals of geometrically ergodic Markov chains similar to Rosenthal inequalities for sums of independent random variables. We pay special attention to the dependence of our bounds on the mixing time of the corresponding chain. Precisely, we establish explicit bounds that are linked to the constants from the martingale version of the Rosenthal inequality, as well as the constants that characterize the mixing properties of the underlying Markov kernel. Finally, our proof technique is, up to our knowledge, new and is based on a recurrent application of the Poisson decomposition.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Cocycles: A Framework for Robust and Coherent Counterfactual Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating joint distributions (a.k.a. couplings) over counterfactual outcomes is central to personalized decision-making and treatment risk assessment. Two emergent frameworks with identifiability guarantees are: (i) bijective structural causal models (SCMs), which are flexible but brittle to mis-specified latent noise; and (ii) optimal-transport (OT) methods, which avoid latent noise assumptions but can produce incoherent counterfactual transports which fail to identify higher-order couplings. In this work, we bridge the gap with \emph{counterfactual cocycles}: a framework for counterfactual transports that use algebraic structure to provide coherence and identifiability guarantees. Every counterfactual cocycle corresponds to an equivalence class of SCMs, however the cocycle is invariant to the latent noise distribution, enabling us to sidestep various mis-specification problems. We characterize the structure of all identifiable counterfactual cocycles; propose flexible model parameterizations; introduce a novel cocycle estimator that avoids any distributional assumptions; and derive mis-specification robustness properties of the resulting counterfactual inference method. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and noise-robustness of counterfactual cocycles across synthetic benchmarks and a 401(k) eligibility study.</description>

      <title>Copy-composition for Probabilistic Graphical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In probabilistic modelling, joint distributions are often of more interest than their marginals, but the standard composition of stochastic channels is defined by marginalization. Last year at ACT, the notion of 'copy-composition' was introduced in order to circumvent this problem and express the chain rule of the relative entropy fibrationally, but while that goal was achieved, copy-composition lacked a satisfactory origin story. Here, we supply such a story for two standard probabilistic tools: directed and undirected graphical models. We explain that (directed) Bayesian networks may be understood as ''stochastic terms'' of product type, in which context copy-composition amounts to a pull-push operation. Likewise, we show that (undirected) factor graphs compose by copy-composition. In each case, our construction yields a double fibration of decorated (co)spans. Along the way, we introduce a useful bifibration of measure kernels, to provide semantics for the notion of stochastic term, which allows us to generalize probabilistic modelling from product to dependent types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.</description>

      <title>Revenue Maximization Under Sequential Price Competition Via The Estimation Of s-Concave Demand Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Improved Scaling Laws in Linear Regression via Data Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase. However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a &gt; b &gt; 1$), we show that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$, where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting, one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse (i.e., choosing $L&gt;N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are also provided to verify our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: The group testing problem consists of determining a sparse subset of defective items from within a larger set of items via a series of tests, where each test outcome indicates whether at least one defective item is included in the test. We study the approximate recovery setting, where the recovery criterion of the defective set is relaxed to allow a small number of items to be misclassified. In particular, we consider one-sided approximate recovery criteria, where we allow either only false negative or only false positive misclassifications. Under false negatives only (i.e., finding a subset of defectives), we show that there exists an algorithm matching the optimal threshold of two-sided approximate recovery. Under false positives only (i.e., finding a superset of the defectives), we provide a converse bound showing that the better of two existing algorithms is optimal.</description>
