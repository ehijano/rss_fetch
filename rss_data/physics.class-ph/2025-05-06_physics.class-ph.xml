      <title>Variational Resolution of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac Equation Pathologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structural variational resolution of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) pathologies. By deriving the Variational Kinematic Constraint (VKC) and the Variational Dynamics Constraint (VDC) from the particle's proper-time perspective, we show that self-induced variations are forbidden and dynamics arise solely from first-order proper-time variations of external fields. Consequently, self-force terms are excluded at the variational level, eliminating runaway solutions and non-causal behavior without regularization. Our framework further provides a first-principles derivation of minimal coupling and reveals gauge invariance as a necessary consequence of proper-time-based variational structure.</description>

      <title>Pedagogical Implications for the Falling Astronaut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper outlines a deceptively complex problem in classical mechanics which the paper names the "Falling Astronaut Problem," and it explores a method for teachers to implement this problem in an undergraduate classroom. The paper presents both an analytical solution and a numerical approximation to the Falling Astronaut Problem and compares the educational merit of the two approaches. The analytical solution is exact; however, the derivation requires techniques that are more advanced than what is typically seen in an introductory undergraduate physics course. In contrast, the numerical approximation presents a novel application of concepts with which a first-semester undergraduate is likely to be familiar. The paper stresses the pedagogical implications of this problem, specifically the opportunity for introductory undergraduate students to learn the utility of differential equations, numerical approximations, and data spreadsheets. On a more fundamental level, the paper argues that the Falling Astronaut Problem presents an instructional opportunity for physics students to acquire a nuanced and informative lens through which to conceptualize cause and effect in the universe.</description>

      <title>Displacement and Stress Analysis of an Elastic Hollow Disk: Comparison with Strength of Materials' Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stress distribution in a two-dimensional elastic disk under diametric loading, with a focus on enhancing the understanding of concrete and rock materials' mechanical behavior. The study revisits the Brazilian test and addresses its high shear stress issue near loading points by exploring the ring test, which introduces a central hole in the disk. Using dynamic elasticity theory, we derive stress distributions over time and extend the analysis to static conditions. This approach distinguishes between longitudinal and transverse wave effects, providing a detailed stress field analysis. By drawing parallels with curved beam theories, we demonstrate the applicability of dynamic elasticity theory to complex stress problems, offering improved insights into the stress behavior in elastic disks.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Classical Dirac-Type Spin from On-Shell Factorisation and Liouvillian Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Liouville's theorem is first order in time for the phase-space distribution itself, the relativistic mass-shell constraint $p^\mu p_\mu = m^2$ is naively second order in energy. We argue it is reasonable to unify both energy branches within a single Hamiltonian by factorising $(p^2 - m^2)$ in analogy with Dirac's approach in relativistic quantum mechanics. We show the resulting matrix-based Liouville equation remains first order and naturally yields a $4\times4$ matrix-valued probability density function in phase space as a classical analogue of a relativistic spin-half Wigner function.</description>
