      <title>Equivalents of NOTOP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working within the context of countable, superstable theories, we give many equivalents of a theory having NOTOP.
  In particular, NOTOP is equivalent to V-DI, the assertion that any type $V$-dominated by an independent triple is isolated over the triple.
  If $T$ has NOTOP, then every model $N$ is atomic over an independent tree of countable, elementary substructures, and hence is
  determined up to back-and-forth equivalence over such a tree.
  We also verify Shelah's assertion from Chapter XII of \cite{Shc} that NOTOP implies PMOP (without using NDOP).</description>

      <title>Optimal Syntactic Definitions of Back-and-Forth Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The back-and-forth relations $M\leq_\alpha N$ are central to computable structure theory and countable model theory. It is well-known that the relation $\{(M,N) : M \leq_\alpha N\}$ is (lightface) $\Pi^0_{2\alpha}$. We show that this is optimal as the set is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_{2\alpha}$-complete. We are also interested in the one-sided relations $\{ N : M \leq_\alpha N\}$ and $\{ N : M \geq_\alpha N\}$ for a fixed $M$, measuring the $\Pi_\alpha$ and $\Sigma_\alpha$ types of $M$. We show that these sets are always $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_{\alpha + 2}$ and $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_{\alpha+3}$ respectively, and that for most $\alpha$ there are structures $M$ for which these relations are complete at that level. In particular, there are structures $M$ such that there is no $\Pi_\alpha$ (or even $\Pi_{\alpha+1})$ sentence $\varphi$ such that $N \models \varphi \Longleftrightarrow M \leq_\alpha N$.
  This is unfortunate as not all $\Pi_{\alpha+2}$ sentences are preserved under $\leq_\alpha$. We define a new hierarchy of syntactic complexity closely related to the back-and-forth game, which can both define the back-and-forth types as well as be preserved by them. These hierarchies of formulas have already been useful in certain Henkin constructions, one of which we give in this paper, and another previously used by Gonzalez and Harrison-Trainor to show that every $\Pi_\alpha$ theory of linear orders has a model with Scott rank at most $\alpha+3$.</description>

      <title>Con($\mathfrak{r}_{\mathsf{nwd}}&lt;\mathfrak{irr}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the consistency of the inequality $\mathfrak{r}_{\mathsf{nwd}}&lt;\mathfrak{irr}$, which in turn implies the consistency of $\mathfrak{r}_\mathsf{nwd}&lt;\mathfrak{i}$ and $\mathfrak{r}_{\mathsf{scatt}}&lt;\mathfrak{irr}$. This answers one question from \cite{balzar_hrusak_hernandez} and one question from \cite{cancino_irresolvable_1}. We also prove the consistency of the inequality $\mathfrak{r}_\mathbb{Q}&lt;\mathfrak{u}_\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>$(\Sigma^2_1)^{uB}$ Statements Are Downwards Absolute To HOD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals, then every $(\Sigma^2_1)^{\mbox{uB}}$ statement that is true in $V$ is true in $\mbox{HOD}$. Moreover, this is true even if we allow a parameter $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $C$ and its complement have scales that are $\mbox{OD}$ and universally Baire. We also investigate whether $(\Sigma^2_1)^{\mbox{uB}}$ statements are upwards absolute from $\mbox{HOD}$ to $V$ under large cardinal hypotheses, observing that this is true if $\mbox{HOD}$ has a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Finally, we discuss $(\forall^{\mathbb{R}})\, (\Sigma^2_1)^{\mbox{uB}}$ absoluteness and conclude that this much absoluteness between $\mbox{HOD}$ and $V$ cannot be implied by any large cardinal axiom consistent with the axiom ``$V =$ Ultimate $L$''.</description>

      <title>Conciseness of first-order formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A word $w$ is concise in a class of groups $\mathcal{C}$ if, for every group $G$ in $\mathcal{C}$, the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is finite whenever $w$ takes only finitely many values in $G$. This notion can be naturally extended to first-order formulae in the language of groups. We consider this more general setting and establish conciseness for various classes of groups and formulae. We prove that all formulae are concise in the class of abelian groups and that every existential formula is concise in the class of torsion-free locally class-2 nilpotent groups. In addition, we construct new examples of weakly rational words, which allow us to produce a wide variety of formulae that are concise in the class of residually finite groups.</description>

      <title>The measure algebra adding $\theta$-many random reals is $\theta$-FAM-linked</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of $\theta$-FAM-linkedness, introduced in the second author's master thesis, is a formalization of the notion of strong FAM limits for intervals, whose initial form and applications have appeared in the work of Saharon Shelah, Jakob Kellner, and Anda T\u{a}nasie, for controlling cardinals characteristics of the continuum in ccc forcing extensions. This generalization was successful in such a thesis to establish a general theory of iterated forcing using finitely additive measures. In this paper, using probability theory tools developed in the same thesis, we refine Saharon Shelah's proof of the fact that random forcing is $\sigma$-FAM-linked and prove that any complete Boolean algebra with a strictly positive probability measure satisfying the $\theta$-density property is $\theta$-FAM-linked. As a consequence, we get a new collection of examples of $\theta$-FAM-linked forcing notions: the measure algebra adding $\theta$-many random reals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For which choices of $X,Y,Z\in\{\Sigma^1_1,\Pi^1_1\}$ does no sufficiently strong $X$-sound and $Y$-definable extension theory prove its own $Z$-soundness? We give a complete answer, thereby delimiting the generalizations of G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem that hold within second-order arithmetic.</description>
