      <title>Non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$ as vector-valued polynomials Part 2: Shift operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$ by means of vector-valued and matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. The interpretation as matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials allows us to introduce shift operators for the non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials. The shift operators are differential-reflection operators and we present four of these operators that are fundamental in the sense that they generate all shift operators. Moreover, the symmetrizations of these fundamental shift operators are the fundamental shift operators for the symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$.
  For the realization of non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$ as invariant $\mathbb{C}^2$-valued Laurent polynomials, we introduce a homomorphism that is analogous to the Harish-Chandra homomorphism for the symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$. For geometric root multiplicities, the non-symmetric Jacobi polynomials of type $BC_1$ can be interpreted as spherical functions and we show that our Harish-Chandra homomorphism in this context is related to the Lepowsky homomorphism via the radial part map.</description>

      <title>Distributional Solution and Spectral Shift Function of Heun Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Heun operator is written as an element in the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathscr{G}=\mathscr{L}(G)$ of the Lie group $G=SL(2,\mathbb{C})$. The Green function and the spectral shift function of the exactly solvable Heun operator from the resulting Lie algebraic equation are obtained via Fourier transform over $G$.</description>

      <title>On solvability of the most general linear boundary-value problems in spaces of smooth functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we develop a general theory of solvability of linear inhomogeneous boundary-value problems for systems of first-order ordinary differential equations in spaces of smooth functions on a finite interval. This problems are set with boundary conditions in generic form, that covers overdetermined and underdetermined cases. They also may contain derivatives, whose orders exceed the order of the differentiall system. Our study is based on using of the so called characteristic matrix of the problem, whose index and Fredholm numbers (i.e., the dimensions of the problem kernel and co-kernel) coincide, respectively, with the index and Fredholm numbers of the inhomogeneous boundary-value problem. We also prove a limit theorems for a sequence of characteristic matrices.</description>

      <title>Estimates for approximately Jensen convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper functions $f:D\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the inequality \[
  f\Big(\frac{x+y}{2}\Big)\leq\frac12f(x)+\frac12f(y)
  +\varphi\Big(\frac{x-y}{2}\Big) \qquad(x,y\in D) \] are studied, where $D$ is a nonempty convex subset of a real linear space $X$ and $\varphi:\{\frac12(x-y) : x,y \in D\}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a so-called error function. In this situation $f$ is said to be $\varphi$-Jensen convex. The main results show that for all $\varphi$-Jensen convex function $f:D\to\mathbb{R}$, for all rational $\lambda\in[0,1]$ and $x,y\in D$, the following inequality holds \[
  f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)
  \leq \lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)+\sum_{k=0}^\infty
  \frac{1}{2^k}\varphi\big(\mbox{dist}(2^k\lambda,\mathbb{Z})\cdot(x-y)\big). \] The infinite series on the right hand side is always convergent, moreover, for all rational $\lambda\in[0,1]$, it can be evaluated as a finite sum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate inequalities that are analogous to the Minkowski and H\"older inequalities by replacing the addition and the multiplication by a more general operation, and instead of using power means, generalized Bajraktarevi\'c means are considered, in particular, Gini means. A further aim is to introduce the concept of local and global validity of such inequalities and to characterize them in both senses.</description>

      <title>Bounds on pseudodifferential operators and Fourier restriction for Schatten classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As main result, we show that a pseudodifferential operator in the Weyl calculus, whose symbol has compact Fourier support, lies in the Schatten class $\mathcal S^p$ if and only if its symbol lies in the Lebesgue space $L^p$ on phase space.
  As an immediate consequence, this gives an alternative and very lucid proof of a recent result by Luef and Samuelsen, who had discovered that for compactly supported measures $\mu,$ classical Fourier restriction estimates with respect to the measure $\mu$ are equivalent to quantum restriction estimates for the Fourier-Wigner transform for Schatten classes.</description>

      <title>Invariant Probability Measures under $p$-adic Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Lebesgue measure is the unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure under the $p$-adic transformation. The purpose of this paper is to characterize the family of all invariant probability measures under the $p$-adic transformation and to provide some description of them. In particular, we describe the subfamily of all atomic invariant measures under the $p$-adic transformation as well as the subfamily of all continuous and singular invariant probability measures under the $p$-adic transformation. Iterative functional equations play the base role in our considerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the Kummer surface, we have obtained two different Gauss metrices by parametrizing it in two ways. We have found that these Gauss metrices are not Ricci flat. The double sphere, which is the special case of the Kummer surface, has the K\"{a}hler metric and the first Chern class of it does not vanish. Its metric is the Einstein metric which is not Ricci flat.</description>

      <title>A new special function related to a discrete Gauss-Poisson distribution and some physics of the cell model with Curie-Weiss interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by previous studies in statistical physics [see, in particular, Kozitsky at al., A phase transition in a Curie-Weiss system with binary interactions, Condens. Matter Phys. 23, 23502 (2020)] we introduce a discrete Gauss-Poisson probability distribution function \begin{equation}\label{GPD}\tag{A1} p_{GP}(n ;z,r)=\left[R(r;z)\right]^{-1}\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2} \end{equation} with support on $\mathbb N_0$ and parameters $z\in\mathbb R$ and $r\in\mathbb R_+$. The probability mass function $p_{GP}(n ;z,r)$ is normalized by the special function $R(r;z)$, given by the infinite sum \begin{equation}\label{R}\tag{A2} R(r;z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\mbox{e}^{zn}}{n!}\,\mbox{e}^{-\frac 12\,rn^2}, \end{equation} possessing extremely intersting mathematical properties. We present an asymptotic estimate $R^{(\rm as)}(r;z\gg1)$ for the function $R(r;z)$ with large arguments $z$, along with similar formulas for its logarithm and logarithmic derivative. These functions exhibit very interesting oscillatory behavior around their asymptotics, for parameters $r$ above some threshold value $r^*$. Some implications of our findings are discussed in the context of the Curie-Weiss cell model of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>Generalized Buchdahl equations as Lie-Hamilton systems: Quantum deformations and their general solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the nonlinear second-order differential equations $$ \ddot{x}(t)=a(x)\dot{x}(t)^2+b(t)\dot{x}(t) $$ where $a(x)$ and $b(t)$ are arbitrary functions on their argument from the perspective of Lie-Hamilton systems. For the particular choice $a(x)=3/x$ and $b(t)=1/t$, these equations reduce to the Buchdahl equation considered in the context of General Relativity. It is shown that these equations are associated to the 'book' Lie algebra $\mathfrak{b}_2$, determining a Lie-Hamilton system for which the corresponding $t$-dependent Hamiltonian and the general solution of the equations are given. The procedure is illustrated considering several particular cases. We also make use of the quantum deformation of $\mathfrak{b}_2$ with quantum deformation parameter $z$ (where $q={\rm e}^z$), leading to a deformed generalized Buchdahl equation. Applying the formalism of Poisson-Hopf deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, we derive the corresponding deformed $t$-dependent Hamiltonian, as well as its general solution. The presence of the quantum deformation parameter $z$ is interpreted as the introduction of an integrable perturbation of the initial generalized Buchdahl equation, which is described in detail in its linear approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study discrete maximal function associated with the Birch-Magyar averages over sparse sequences. We establish sparse domination principle for such operators. As a consequence, we obtain $\ell^p$-estimates for such discrete maximal function over sparse sequences for all $p&gt;1$. The proof of sparse bounds is based on scale-free $\ell^p-$improving estimates for the single scale Birch-Magyar averages.</description>

      <title>Fibre stability for dominated self-affine sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a planar self-affine set. Assuming a weak domination condition on the matrix parts, we prove for all backward Furstenberg directions $V$ that $$\max_{E\in\operatorname{Tan}(K)} \max_{x\in \pi_{V^\bot}(E)} \operatorname{dim_H} (\pi_{V^\bot}^{-1}(x)\cap E) = \operatorname{dim_A} K - \operatorname{dim_A} \pi_{V^\bot}(K).$$ Here, $\operatorname{Tan}(K)$ denotes the space of weak tangents of $K$. Unlike previous work on this topic, we require no separation or irreducibility assumptions. However, if in addition the strong separation condition holds, then there exists a $V\in X_F$ so that $$\max_{x\in \pi_{V^\bot}(K)} \operatorname{dim_H} (\pi_{V^\bot}^{-1}(x)\cap K) = \operatorname{dim_A} K - \operatorname{dim_A} \pi_{V^\bot}(K).$$ Our key innovation is an amplification result for slices of weak tangents via pigeonholing arguments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we exhibit new monotonicity properties of roots of families of orthogonal polynomials $P_n^{(z)}(x)$ depending polynomially on a parameter (Laguerre and Gegenbauer). By establishing that $P_n^{(z)}(x)$ are realrooted in $z$ for $x$ in the support of orthogonality, we show realrootedness in $x$ and interlacing properties of $\partial_z^kP_n^{(z)}(x)$ for $k\leq n$ and $z \geq 0$, establishing a dual approach to orthogonality.</description>

      <title>Exponential asymptotics and higher-order Stokes phenomenon in singularly perturbed ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The higher-order Stokes phenomenon can emerge in the asymptotic analysis of many problems governed by singular perturbations. Indeed, over the last two decades, the phenomena has appeared in many physical applications, from acoustic and optical wave phenomena and gravity-capillary ripples, to models of crystal growth and equatorial Kelvin waves. It emerges in a generic fashion in the exponential asymptotics of higher-order ordinary and partial differential equations. The intention of this work is to highlight its importance, and develop further practical methodologies for the study of higher-order Stokes phenomena, primarily for general non-integrable problems. Our formal methodology is demonstrated through application to a second-order linear inhomogeneous ODE that exemplifies the simplest example of higher-order Stokes phenomena. In this model problem, the Borel transform can be derived explicitly, and this gives insight into the beyond-all-orders structure. We review and study additional examples, with physically-important connections, including higher-order ODEs and eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Bounds for extreme zeros of Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider connection formulae for orthogonal polynomials in the context of Christoffel transformations for the case where a weight function, not necessarily even, is multiplied by an even function $c_{2k}(x),k\in N_0$, to determine new lower bounds for the largest zero and upper bounds for the smallest zero of a Meixner-Pollaczek polynomial. When $p_n$ is orthogonal with respect to a weight $w(x)$ and $g_{n-m}$ is orthogonal with respect to the weight $c_{2k}(x)w(x)$, we show that $k\in\{0,1,\dots,m\}$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a connection formula involving a polynomial $G_{m-1}$ of degree $(m-1)$, such that the $(n-1)$ zeros of $G_{m-1}g_{n-m}$ and the $n$ zeros of $p_n$ interlace. We analyse the new inner bounds for the extreme zeros of Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials to determine which bounds are the sharpest. We also briefly discuss bounds for the zeros of Pseudo-Jacobi polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we come up with a dual version of the Furstenberg problem and obtain partial results via $L^p$ estimates of orthogonal projections. Examples are also discussed. Moreover, compared with general sets, we find that special structure like Cartesian product has better $L^p$-behavior. This leads to improvement on some discretized sum-product estimates.</description>

      <title>A multiplicity result for Hamiltonian systems with mixed periodic-type and Neumann-type boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity of solutions for a Hamiltonian system coupling two systems associated with mixed boundary conditions. Corresponding to the first system, we impose periodic boundary conditions and assume the twist assumption commonly used for the Poincar\'e--Birkhoff theorem, while for the second one, we consider a two-point boundary conditions of Neumann type.</description>

      <title>On some inequalities for the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ with $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $\beta \ge 0,$ we consider the question whether $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|$ and $E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z)$ are comparable on the whole complex plane. We show that the inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\le E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z)$ holds globally if and only if $E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x)$ is completely monotone on $(0,\infty)$. For $\alpha\in [1,2)$ we prove that the complete monotonicity of $1/E_{\alpha,\beta}(x)$ on $(0,\infty)$ is necessary for the global inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\ge E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z),$ and also sufficient for $\alpha =1.$ For $\alpha \ge 2$ we show that the absence of non-real zeros for $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ is sufficient for the global inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\ge E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z),$ and also necessary for $\alpha =2.$ All these results have an explicit description in terms of the values of the parameters $\alpha,\beta.$ Along the way, several inequalities for $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ on the half-plane $\{\Re z \ge 0\}$ are established, and a characterization of its log-convexity resp. log-concavity on the positive half-line is obtained.</description>

      <title>Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent method termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method converges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggested by Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates in finitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features. Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known source and other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both the regularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient method using a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practical efficacy of the proposed method.</description>
