      <title>PIETRA: Physics-Informed Evidential Learning for Traversing Out-of-Distribution Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a powerful approach for developing traversability models for off-road navigation, but these models often struggle with inputs unseen during training. Existing methods utilize techniques like evidential deep learning to quantify model uncertainty, helping to identify and avoid out-of-distribution terrain. However, always avoiding out-of-distribution terrain can be overly conservative, e.g., when novel terrain can be effectively analyzed using a physics-based model. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Physics-Informed Evidential Traversability (PIETRA), a self-supervised learning framework that integrates physics priors directly into the mathematical formulation of evidential neural networks and introduces physics knowledge implicitly through an uncertainty-aware, physics-informed training loss. Our evidential network seamlessly transitions between learned and physics-based predictions for out-of-distribution inputs. Additionally, the physics-informed loss regularizes the learned model, ensuring better alignment with the physics model. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that PIETRA improves both learning accuracy and navigation performance in environments with significant distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>RoboKoop: Efficient Control Conditioned Representations from Visual Input in Robotics using Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing agents that can perform complex control tasks from high-dimensional observations is a core ability of autonomous agents that requires underlying robust task control policies and adapting the underlying visual representations to the task. Most existing policies need a lot of training samples and treat this problem from the lens of two-stage learning with a controller learned on top of pre-trained vision models. We approach this problem from the lens of Koopman theory and learn visual representations from robotic agents conditioned on specific downstream tasks in the context of learning stabilizing control for the agent. We introduce a Contrastive Spectral Koopman Embedding network that allows us to learn efficient linearized visual representations from the agent's visual data in a high dimensional latent space and utilizes reinforcement learning to perform off-policy control on top of the extracted representations with a linear controller. Our method enhances stability and control in gradient dynamics over time, significantly outperforming existing approaches by improving efficiency and accuracy in learning task policies over extended horizons.</description>

      <title>Developing, Analyzing, and Evaluating Self-Drive Algorithms Using Drive-by-Wire Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable lane-following algorithms are essential for safe and effective autonomous driving. This project was primarily focused on developing and evaluating different lane-following programs to find the most reliable algorithm for a Vehicle to Everything (V2X) project. The algorithms were first tested on a simulator and then with real vehicles equipped with a drive-by-wire system using ROS (Robot Operating System). Their performance was assessed through reliability, comfort, speed, and adaptability metrics. The results show that the two most reliable approaches detect both lane lines and use unsupervised learning to separate them. These approaches proved to be robust in various driving scenarios, making them suitable candidates for integration into the V2X project.</description>

      <title>Approximate Environment Decompositions for Robot Coverage Planning using Submodular Set Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of decomposing 2D environments for robot coverage planning. Coverage path planning (CPP) involves computing a cost-minimizing path for a robot equipped with a coverage or sensing tool so that the tool visits all points in the environment. CPP is an NP-Hard problem, so existing approaches simplify the problem by decomposing the environment into the minimum number of sectors. Sectors are sub-regions of the environment that can each be covered using a lawnmower path (i.e., along parallel straight-line paths) oriented at an angle. However, traditional methods either limit the coverage orientations to be axis-parallel (horizontal/vertical) or provide no guarantees on the number of sectors in the decomposition. We introduce an approach to decompose the environment into possibly overlapping rectangular sectors. We provide an approximation guarantee on the number of sectors computed using our approach for a given environment. We do this by leveraging the submodular property of the sector coverage function, which enables us to formulate the decomposition problem as a submodular set cover (SSC) problem with well-known approximation guarantees for the greedy algorithm. Our approach improves upon existing coverage planning methods, as demonstrated through an evaluation using maps of complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Drifting Based on Maximal Safety Probability Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel learning-based framework for autonomous driving based on the concept of maximal safety probability. Efficient learning requires rewards that are informative of desirable/undesirable states, but such rewards are challenging to design manually due to the difficulty of differentiating better states among many safe states. On the other hand, learning policies that maximize safety probability does not require laborious reward shaping but is numerically challenging because the algorithms must optimize policies based on binary rewards sparse in time. Here, we show that physics-informed reinforcement learning can efficiently learn this form of maximally safe policy. Unlike existing drift control methods, our approach does not require a specific reference trajectory or complex reward shaping, and can learn safe behaviors only from sparse binary rewards. This is enabled by the use of the physics loss that plays an analogous role to reward shaping. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through lane keeping in a normal cornering scenario and safe drifting in a high-speed racing scenario.</description>

      <title>Continual Skill and Task Learning via Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual and interactive robot learning is a challenging problem as the robot is present with human users who expect the robot to learn novel skills to solve novel tasks perpetually with sample efficiency. In this work we present a framework for robots to query and learn visuo-motor robot skills and task relevant information via natural language dialog interactions with human users. Previous approaches either focus on improving the performance of instruction following agents, or passively learn novel skills or concepts. Instead, we used dialog combined with a language-skill grounding embedding to query or confirm skills and/or tasks requested by a user. To achieve this goal, we developed and integrated three different components for our agent. Firstly, we propose a novel visual-motor control policy ACT with Low Rank Adaptation (ACT-LoRA), which enables the existing SoTA ACT model to perform few-shot continual learning. Secondly, we develop an alignment model that projects demonstrations across skill embodiments into a shared embedding allowing us to know when to ask questions and/or demonstrations from users. Finally, we integrated an existing LLM to interact with a human user to perform grounded interactive continual skill learning to solve a task. Our ACT-LoRA model learns novel fine-tuned skills with a 100% accuracy when trained with only five demonstrations for a novel skill while still maintaining a 74.75% accuracy on pre-trained skills in the RLBench dataset where other models fall significantly short. We also performed a human-subjects study with 8 subjects to demonstrate the continual learning capabilities of our combined framework. We achieve a success rate of 75% in the task of sandwich making with the real robot learning from participant data demonstrating that robots can learn novel skills or task knowledge from dialogue with non-expert users using our approach.</description>

      <title>Solving Stochastic Orienteering Problems with Chance Constraints Using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to solve the stochastic orienteering problem with chance constraints, i.e., a version of the problem where travel costs are random, and one is assigned a bound on the tolerable probability of exceeding the budget. The algorithm we present is online and anytime, i.e., it alternates planning and execution, and the quality of the solution it produces increases as the allowed computational time increases. Differently from most former MCTS algorithms, for each action available in a state the algorithm maintains estimates of both its value and the probability that its execution will eventually result in a violation of the chance constraint. Then, at action selection time, our proposed solution prunes away trajectories that are estimated to violate the failure probability. Extensive simulation results show that this approach can quickly produce high-quality solutions and is competitive with the optimal but time-consuming solution.</description>

      <title>Upper-Limb Rehabilitation with a Dual-Mode Individualized Exoskeleton Robot: A Generative-Model-Based Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several upper-limb exoskeleton robots have been developed for stroke rehabilitation, but their rather low level of individualized assistance typically limits their effectiveness and practicability. Individualized assistance involves an upper-limb exoskeleton robot continuously assessing feedback from a stroke patient and then meticulously adjusting interaction forces to suit specific conditions and online changes. This paper describes the development of a new upper-limb exoskeleton robot with a novel online generative capability that allows it to provide individualized assistance to support the rehabilitation training of stroke patients. Specifically, the upper-limb exoskeleton robot exploits generative models to customize the fine and fit trajectory for the patient, as medical conditions, responses, and comfort feedback during training generally differ between patients. This generative capability is integrated into the two working modes of the upper-limb exoskeleton robot: an active mirroring mode for patients who retain motor abilities on one side of the body and a passive following mode for patients who lack motor ability on both sides of the body. The performance of the upper-limb exoskeleton robot was illustrated in experiments involving healthy subjects and stroke patients.</description>

      <title>Improving agent performance in fluid environments by perceptual pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a pretraining framework for fluid environment perception, which includes an information compression model and the corresponding pretraining method. We test this framework in a two-cylinder problem through numerical simulation. The results show that after unsupervised pretraining with this framework, the intelligent agent can acquire key features of surrounding fluid environment, thereby adapting more quickly and effectively to subsequent multi-scenario tasks. In our research, these tasks include perceiving the position of the upstream obstacle and actively avoiding shedding vortices in the flow field to achieve drag reduction. Better performance of the pretrained agent is discussed in the sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Bringing the RT-1-X Foundation Model to a SCARA robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional robotic systems require specific training data for each task, environment, and robot form. While recent advancements in machine learning have enabled models to generalize across new tasks and environments, the challenge of adapting these models to entirely new settings remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this by investigating the generalization capabilities of the RT-1-X robotic foundation model to a type of robot unseen during its training: a SCARA robot from UMI-RTX.
  Initial experiments reveal that RT-1-X does not generalize zero-shot to the unseen type of robot. However, fine-tuning of the RT-1-X model by demonstration allows the robot to learn a pickup task which was part of the foundation model (but learned for another type of robot). When the robot is presented with an object that is included in the foundation model but not in the fine-tuning dataset, it demonstrates that only the skill, but not the object-specific knowledge, has been transferred.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising focus on quadrupeds, a generalized policy capable of handling different robot models and sensory inputs will be highly beneficial. Although several methods have been proposed to address different morphologies, it remains a challenge for learning-based policies to manage various combinations of proprioceptive information. This paper presents Masked Sensory-Temporal Attention (MSTA), a novel transformer-based model with masking for quadruped locomotion. It employs direct sensor-level attention to enhance sensory-temporal understanding and handle different combinations of sensor data, serving as a foundation for incorporating unseen information. This model can effectively understand its states even with a large portion of missing information, and is flexible enough to be deployed on a physical system despite the long input sequence.</description>

      <title>Fast Payload Calibration for Sensorless Contact Estimation Using Model Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force and torque sensing is crucial in robotic manipulation across both collaborative and industrial settings. Traditional methods for dynamics identification enable the detection and control of external forces and torques without the need for costly sensors. However, these approaches show limitations in scenarios where robot dynamics, particularly the end-effector payload, are subject to changes. Moreover, existing calibration techniques face trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy due to concerns over joint space coverage. In this paper, we introduce a calibration scheme that leverages pre-trained Neural Network models to learn calibrated dynamics across a wide range of joint space in advance. This offline learning strategy significantly reduces the need for online data collection, whether for selection of the optimal model or identification of payload features, necessitating merely a 4-second trajectory for online calibration. This method is particularly effective in tasks that require frequent dynamics recalibration for precise contact estimation. We further demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through applications in sensorless joint and task compliance, accounting for payload variability.</description>

      <title>RoVi-Aug: Robot and Viewpoint Augmentation for Cross-Embodiment Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up robot learning requires large and diverse datasets, and how to efficiently reuse collected data and transfer policies to new embodiments remains an open question. Emerging research such as the Open-X Embodiment (OXE) project has shown promise in leveraging skills by combining datasets including different robots. However, imbalances in the distribution of robot types and camera angles in many datasets make policies prone to overfit. To mitigate this issue, we propose RoVi-Aug, which leverages state-of-the-art image-to-image generative models to augment robot data by synthesizing demonstrations with different robots and camera views. Through extensive physical experiments, we show that, by training on robot- and viewpoint-augmented data, RoVi-Aug can zero-shot deploy on an unseen robot with significantly different camera angles. Compared to test-time adaptation algorithms such as Mirage, RoVi-Aug requires no extra processing at test time, does not assume known camera angles, and allows policy fine-tuning. Moreover, by co-training on both the original and augmented robot datasets, RoVi-Aug can learn multi-robot and multi-task policies, enabling more efficient transfer between robots and skills and improving success rates by up to 30%.</description>

      <title>F3T: A soft tactile unit with 3D force and temperature mathematical decoupling ability for robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human skin exhibits remarkable capability to perceive contact forces and environmental temperatures, providing intricate information essential for nuanced manipulation. Despite recent advancements in soft tactile sensors, a significant challenge remains in accurately decoupling signals - specifically, separating force from directional orientation and temperature - resulting in fail to meet the advanced application requirements of robots. This research proposes a multi-layered soft sensor unit (F3T) designed to achieve isolated measurements and mathematical decoupling of normal pressure, omnidirectional tangential forces, and temperature. We developed a circular coaxial magnetic film featuring a floating-mountain multi-layer capacitor, facilitating the physical decoupling of normal and tangential forces in all directions. Additionally, we incorporated an ion gel-based temperature sensing film atop the tactile sensor. This sensor is resilient to external pressure and deformation, enabling it to measure temperature and, crucially, eliminate capacitor errors induced by environmental temperature changes. This innovative design allows for the decoupled measurement of multiple signals, paving the way for advancements in higher-level robot motion control, autonomous decision-making, and task planning.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimizing Profilometric Sensor Trajectories for Surface Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision surface defect detection in manufacturing is essential for ensuring quality control. Laser triangulation profilometric sensors are key to this process, providing detailed and accurate surface measurements over a line. To achieve a complete and precise surface scan, accurate relative motion between the sensor and the workpiece is required. It is crucial to control the sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.</description>

      <title>KiloBot: A Programming Language for Deploying Perception-Guided Industrial Manipulators at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We would like industrial robots to handle unstructured environments with cameras and perception pipelines. In contrast to traditional industrial robots that replay offline-crafted trajectories, online behavior planning is required for these perception-guided industrial applications. Aside from perception and planning algorithms, deploying perception-guided manipulators also requires substantial effort in integration. One approach is writing scripts in a traditional language (such as Python) to construct the planning problem and perform integration with other algorithmic modules &amp; external devices. While scripting in Python is feasible for a handful of robots and applications, deploying perception-guided manipulation at scale (e.g., more than 10000 robot workstations in over 2000 customer sites) becomes intractable. To resolve this challenge, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for perception-guided manipulation applications. To scale up the deployment,our DSL provides: 1) an easily accessible interface to construct &amp; solve a sub-class of Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problems that are important in practical applications; and 2) a mechanism to implement flexible control flow to perform integration and address customized requirements of distinct industrial application. Combined with an intuitive graphical programming frontend, our DSL is mainly used by machine operators without coding experience in traditional programming languages. Within hours of training, operators are capable of orchestrating interesting sophisticated manipulation behaviors with our DSL. Extensive practical deployments demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Neural HD Map Generation from Multiple Vectorized Tiles Locally Produced by Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-definition (HD) map is a fundamental component of autonomous driving systems, as it can provide precise environmental information about driving scenes. Recent work on vectorized map generation could produce merely 65% local map elements around the ego-vehicle at runtime by one tour with onboard sensors, leaving a puzzle of how to construct a global HD map projected in the world coordinate system under high-quality standards. To address the issue, we present GNMap as an end-to-end generative neural network to automatically construct HD maps with multiple vectorized tiles which are locally produced by autonomous vehicles through several tours. It leverages a multi-layer and attention-based autoencoder as the shared network, of which parameters are learned from two different tasks (i.e., pretraining and finetuning, respectively) to ensure both the completeness of generated maps and the correctness of element categories. Abundant qualitative evaluations are conducted on a real-world dataset and experimental results show that GNMap can surpass the SOTA method by more than 5% F1 score, reaching the level of industrial usage with a small amount of manual modification. We have already deployed it at Navinfo Co., Ltd., serving as an indispensable software to automatically build HD maps for autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>FLAF: Focal Line and Feature-constrained Active View Planning for Visual Teach and Repeat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents FLAF, a focal line and feature-constrained active view planning method for tracking failure avoidance in feature-based visual navigation of mobile robots. Our FLAF-based visual navigation is built upon a feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT\&amp;R) framework, which supports many robotic applications by teaching a robot to navigate on various paths that cover a significant portion of daily autonomous navigation requirements. However, tracking failure in feature-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) caused by textureless regions in human-made environments is still limiting VT\&amp;R to be adopted in the real world. To address this problem, the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based visual SLAM system to build up an active VT\&amp;R system that avoids tracking failure. In our system, a pan-tilt unit (PTU)-based active camera is mounted on the mobile robot. Using FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM operates during the teaching phase to construct a complete path map and in the repeat phase to maintain stable localization. FLAF orients the robot toward more map points to avoid mapping failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points beneficial for localization while following the learned trajectory. Experiments in real scenarios demonstrate that FLAF outperforms the methods that do not consider feature-identifiability, and our active VT\&amp;R system performs well in complex environments by effectively dealing with low-texture regions.</description>

      <title>Interactive Surgical Liver Phantom for Cholecystectomy Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training and prototype development in robot-assisted surgery requires appropriate and safe environments for the execution of surgical procedures. Current dry lab laparoscopy phantoms often lack the ability to mimic complex, interactive surgical tasks. This work presents an interactive surgical phantom for the cholecystectomy. The phantom enables the removal of the gallbladder during cholecystectomy by allowing manipulations and cutting interactions with the synthetic tissue. The force-displacement behavior of the gallbladder is modelled based on retraction demonstrations. The force model is compared to the force model of ex-vivo porcine gallbladders and evaluated on its ability to estimate retraction forces.</description>

      <title>MaskVal: Simple but Effective Uncertainty Quantification for 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the use of 6D pose estimation in robotic applications, reliable poses are of utmost importance to ensure a safe, reliable and predictable operational performance. Despite these requirements, state-of-the-art 6D pose estimators often do not provide any uncertainty quantification for their pose estimates at all, or if they do, it has been shown that the uncertainty provided is only weakly correlated with the actual true error. To address this issue, we investigate a simple but effective uncertainty quantification, that we call MaskVal, which compares the pose estimates with their corresponding instance segmentations by rendering and does not require any modification of the pose estimator itself. Despite its simplicity, MaskVal significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art ensemble method on both a dataset and a robotic setup. We show that by using MaskVal, the performance of a state-of-the-art 6D pose estimator is significantly improved towards a safe and reliable operation. In addition, we propose a new and specific approach to compare and evaluate uncertainty quantification methods for 6D pose estimation in the context of robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>1 Modular Parallel Manipulator for Long-Term Soft Robotic Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing long-term experimentation or large-scale data collection for machine learning in the field of soft robotics is challenging, due to the hardware robustness and experimental flexibility required. In this work, we propose a modular parallel robotic manipulation platform suitable for such large-scale data collection and compatible with various soft-robotic fabrication methods. Considering the computational and theoretical difficulty of replicating the high-fidelity, faster-than-real-time simulations that enable large-scale data collection in rigid robotic systems, a robust soft-robotic hardware platform becomes a high priority development task for the field.
  The platform's modules consist of a pair of off-the-shelf electrical motors which actuate a customizable finger consisting of a compliant parallel structure. The parallel mechanism of the finger can be as simple as a single 3D-printed urethane or molded silicone bulk structure, due to the motors being able to fully actuate a passive structure. This design flexibility allows experimentation with soft mechanism varied geometries, bulk properties and surface properties. Additionally, while the parallel mechanism does not require separate electronics or additional parts, these can be included, and it can be constructed using multi-functional soft materials to study compatible soft sensors and actuators in the learning process. In this work, we validate the platform's ability to be used for policy gradient reinforcement learning directly on hardware in a benchmark 2D manipulation task. We additionally demonstrate compatibility with multiple fingers and characterize the design constraints for compatible extensions.</description>

      <title>View-Invariant Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale visuomotor policy learning is a promising approach toward developing generalizable manipulation systems. Yet, policies that can be deployed on diverse embodiments, environments, and observational modalities remain elusive. In this work, we investigate how knowledge from large-scale visual data of the world may be used to address one axis of variation for generalizable manipulation: observational viewpoint. Specifically, we study single-image novel view synthesis models, which learn 3D-aware scene-level priors by rendering images of the same scene from alternate camera viewpoints given a single input image. For practical application to diverse robotic data, these models must operate zero-shot, performing view synthesis on unseen tasks and environments. We empirically analyze view synthesis models within a simple data-augmentation scheme that we call View Synthesis Augmentation (VISTA) to understand their capabilities for learning viewpoint-invariant policies from single-viewpoint demonstration data. Upon evaluating the robustness of policies trained with our method to out-of-distribution camera viewpoints, we find that they outperform baselines in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

      <title>Reprogrammable sequencing for physically intelligent under-actuated robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming physical intelligence into mechanisms holds great promise for machines that can accomplish tasks such as navigation of unstructured environments while utilizing a minimal amount of computational resources and electronic components. In this study, we introduce a novel design approach for physically intelligent under-actuated mechanisms capable of autonomously adjusting their motion in response to environmental interactions. Specifically, multistability is harnessed to sequence the motion of different degrees of freedom in a programmed order. A key aspect of this approach is that these sequences can be passively reprogrammed through mechanical stimuli that arise from interactions with the environment. To showcase our approach, we construct a four degree of freedom robot capable of autonomously navigating mazes and moving away from obstacles. Remarkably, this robot operates without relying on traditional computational architectures and utilizes only a single linear actuator.</description>

      <title>Incorporating dense metric depth into neural 3D representations for view synthesis and relighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing accurate geometry and photo-realistic appearance of small scenes is an active area of research with compelling use cases in gaming, virtual reality, robotic-manipulation, autonomous driving, convenient product capture, and consumer-level photography. When applying scene geometry and appearance estimation techniques to robotics, we found that the narrow cone of possible viewpoints due to the limited range of robot motion and scene clutter caused current estimation techniques to produce poor quality estimates or even fail. On the other hand, in robotic applications, dense metric depth can often be measured directly using stereo and illumination can be controlled. Depth can provide a good initial estimate of the object geometry to improve reconstruction, while multi-illumination images can facilitate relighting. In this work we demonstrate a method to incorporate dense metric depth into the training of neural 3D representations and address an artifact observed while jointly refining geometry and appearance by disambiguating between texture and geometry edges. We also discuss a multi-flash stereo camera system developed to capture the necessary data for our pipeline and show results on relighting and view synthesis with a few training views.</description>

      <title>Can we enhance prosocial behavior? Using post-ride feedback to improve micromobility interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micromobility devices, such as e-scooters and delivery robots, hold promise for eco-friendly and cost-effective alternatives for future urban transportation. However, their lack of societal acceptance remains a challenge. Therefore, we must consider ways to promote prosocial behavior in micromobility interactions. We investigate how post-ride feedback can encourage the prosocial behavior of e-scooter riders while interacting with sidewalk users, including pedestrians and delivery robots. Using a web-based platform, we measure the prosocial behavior of e-scooter riders. Results found that post-ride feedback can successfully promote prosocial behavior, and objective measures indicated better gap behavior, lower speeds at interaction, and longer stopping time around other sidewalk actors. The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of post-ride feedback and provide a step toward designing methodologies to improve the prosocial behavior of mobility users.</description>

      <title>OccLLaMA: An Occupancy-Language-Action Generative World Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) has spurred their applications in autonomous driving. Recent MLLM-based methods perform action by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the dynamics of the world and the relations between action and world dynamics. In contrast, human beings possess world model that enables them to simulate the future states based on 3D internal visual representation and plan actions accordingly. To this end, we propose OccLLaMA, an occupancy-language-action generative world model, which uses semantic occupancy as a general visual representation and unifies vision-language-action(VLA) modalities through an autoregressive model. Specifically, we introduce a novel VQVAE-like scene tokenizer to efficiently discretize and reconstruct semantic occupancy scenes, considering its sparsity and classes imbalance. Then, we build a unified multi-modal vocabulary for vision, language and action. Furthermore, we enhance LLM, specifically LLaMA, to perform the next token/scene prediction on the unified vocabulary to complete multiple tasks in autonomous driving. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccLLaMA achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks, including 4D occupancy forecasting, motion planning, and visual question answering, showcasing its potential as a foundation model in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>MouseSIS: A Frames-and-Events Dataset for Space-Time Instance Segmentation of Mice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabled by large annotated datasets, tracking and segmentation of objects in videos has made remarkable progress in recent years. Despite these advancements, algorithms still struggle under degraded conditions and during fast movements. Event cameras are novel sensors with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range that offer promising advantages to address these challenges. However, annotated data for developing learning-based mask-level tracking algorithms with events is not available. To this end, we introduce: ($i$) a new task termed \emph{space-time instance segmentation}, similar to video instance segmentation, whose goal is to segment instances throughout the entire duration of the sensor input (here, the input are quasi-continuous events and optionally aligned frames); and ($ii$) \emph{\dname}, a dataset for the new task, containing aligned grayscale frames and events. It includes annotated ground-truth labels (pixel-level instance segmentation masks) of a group of up to seven freely moving and interacting mice. We also provide two reference methods, which show that leveraging event data can consistently improve tracking performance, especially when used in combination with conventional cameras. The results highlight the potential of event-aided tracking in difficult scenarios. We hope our dataset opens the field of event-based video instance segmentation and enables the development of robust tracking algorithms for challenging conditions.\url{https://github.com/tub-rip/MouseSIS}</description>

      <title>Game On: Towards Language Models as RL Experimenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an agent architecture that automates parts of the common reinforcement learning experiment workflow, to enable automated mastery of control domains for embodied agents. To do so, it leverages a VLM to perform some of the capabilities normally required of a human experimenter, including the monitoring and analysis of experiment progress, the proposition of new tasks based on past successes and failures of the agent, decomposing tasks into a sequence of subtasks (skills), and retrieval of the skill to execute - enabling our system to build automated curricula for learning. We believe this is one of the first proposals for a system that leverages a VLM throughout the full experiment cycle of reinforcement learning. We provide a first prototype of this system, and examine the feasibility of current models and techniques for the desired level of automation. For this, we use a standard Gemini model, without additional fine-tuning, to provide a curriculum of skills to a language-conditioned Actor-Critic algorithm, in order to steer data collection so as to aid learning new skills. Data collected in this way is shown to be useful for learning and iteratively improving control policies in a robotics domain. Additional examination of the ability of the system to build a growing library of skills, and to judge the progress of the training of those skills, also shows promising results, suggesting that the proposed architecture provides a potential recipe for fully automated mastery of tasks and domains for embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Lexicon3D: Probing Visual Foundation Models for Complex 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex 3D scene understanding has gained increasing attention, with scene encoding strategies playing a crucial role in this success. However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.</description>

      <title>Quadrotor Manipulation System: Development of a Robust Contact Force Estimation and Impedance Control Scheme Based on DOb and FTRLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.00008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The research on aerial manipulation systems has been increased rapidly in recent years. These systems are very attractive for a wide range of applications due to their unique features. However, dynamics, control and manipulation tasks of such systems are quite challenging because they are naturally unstable, have very fast dynamics, have strong nonlinearities, are very susceptible to parameters variations due to carrying a payload besides the external disturbances, and have complex inverse kinematics. In addition, the manipulation tasks require estimating (applying) a certain force of (at) the end-effector as well as the accurate positioning of it. Thus, in this article, a robust force estimation and impedance control scheme is proposed to address these issues. The robustness is achieved based on the Disturbance Observer (DOb) technique. Then, a tracking and performance low computational linear controller is used. For teleoperation purpose, the contact force needs to be identified. However, the current developed techniques for force estimation have limitations because they are based on ignoring some dynamics and/or requiring of an indicator of the environment contact. Unlike these techniques, we propose a technique based on linearization capabilities of DOb and a Fast Tracking Recursive Least Squares (FTRLS) algorithm. The complex inverse kinematics problem of such a system is solved by a Jacobin based algorithm. The stability analysis of the proposed scheme is presented. The algorithm is tested to achieve tracking of task space reference trajectories besides the impedance control. The efficiency of the proposed technique is enlightened via numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Incremental Penetration Depth Estimation between Convex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penetration depth (PD) is essential for robotics due to its extensive applications in dynamic simulation, motion planning, haptic rendering, etc. The Expanding Polytope Algorithm (EPA) is the de facto standard for this problem, which estimates PD by expanding an inner polyhedral approximation of an implicit set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based algorithm that incrementally estimates minimum penetration depth and its direction. One major advantage of our method is that it can be warm-started by exploiting the spatial and temporal coherence, which emerges naturally in many robotic applications (e.g., the temporal coherence between adjacent simulation time knots). As a result, our algorithm achieves substantial speedup -- we demonstrate it is 5-30x faster than EPA on several benchmarks. Moreover, our approach is built upon the same implicit geometry representation as EPA, which enables easy integration and deployment into existing software stacks. We also provide an open-source implementation on: https://github.com/weigao95/mind-fcl</description>

      <title>MimicTouch: Leveraging Multi-modal Human Tactile Demonstrations for Contact-rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is critical to fine-grained, contact-rich manipulation tasks, such as insertion and assembly. Prior research has shown the possibility of learning tactile-guided policy from teleoperated demonstration data. However, to provide the demonstration, human users often rely on visual feedback to control the robot. This creates a gap between the sensing modality used for controlling the robot (visual) and the modality of interest (tactile). To bridge this gap, we introduce "MimicTouch", a novel framework for learning policies directly from demonstrations provided by human users with their hands. The key innovations are i) a human tactile data collection system which collects multi-modal tactile dataset for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy, ii) an imitation learning-based framework for learning human's tactile-guided control strategy through such data, and iii) an online residual RL framework to bridge the embodiment gap between the human hand and the robot gripper. Through comprehensive experiments, we highlight the efficacy of utilizing human's tactile-guided control strategy to resolve contact-rich manipulation tasks.

      <title>Automatic Robot Hand-Eye Calibration Enabled by Learning-Based 3D Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hand-eye calibration, as a fundamental task in vision-based robotic systems, aims to estimate the transformation matrix between the coordinate frame of the camera and the robot flange. Most approaches to hand-eye calibration rely on external markers or human assistance. We proposed Look at Robot Base Once (LRBO), a novel methodology that addresses the hand-eye calibration problem without external calibration objects or human support, but with the robot base. Using point clouds of the robot base, a transformation matrix from the coordinate frame of the camera to the robot base is established as I=AXB. To this end, we exploit learning-based 3D detection and registration algorithms to estimate the location and orientation of the robot base. The robustness and accuracy of the method are quantified by ground-truth-based evaluation, and the accuracy result is compared with other 3D vision-based calibration methods. To assess the feasibility of our methodology, we carried out experiments utilizing a low-cost structured light scanner across varying joint configurations and groups of experiments. The proposed hand-eye calibration method achieved a translation deviation of 0.930 mm and a rotation deviation of 0.265 degrees according to the experimental results. Additionally, the 3D reconstruction experiments demonstrated a rotation error of 0.994 degrees and a position error of 1.697 mm. Moreover, our method offers the potential to be completed in 1 second, which is the fastest compared to other 3D hand-eye calibration methods. Code is released at github.com/leihui6/LRBO.</description>

      <title>FRAC-Q-Learning: A Reinforcement Learning with Boredom Avoidance Processes for Social Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15327v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reinforcement learning algorithms have often been applied to social robots. However, most reinforcement learning algorithms were not optimized for the use of social robots, and consequently they may bore users. We proposed a new reinforcement learning method specialized for the social robot, the FRAC-Q-learning, that can avoid user boredom. The proposed algorithm consists of a forgetting process in addition to randomizing and categorizing processes. This study evaluated interest and boredom hardness scores of the FRAC-Q-learning by a comparison with the traditional Q-learning. The FRAC-Q-learning showed significantly higher trend of interest score, and indicated significantly harder to bore users compared to the traditional Q-learning. Therefore, the FRAC-Q-learning can contribute to develop a social robot that will not bore users. The proposed algorithm has a potential to apply for Web-based communication and educational systems. This paper presents the entire process, detailed implementation and a detailed evaluation method of the of the FRAC-Q-learning for the first time.</description>

      <title>VANP: Learning Where to See for Navigation with Self-Supervised Vision-Action Pre-Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans excel at efficiently navigating through crowds without collision by focusing on specific visual regions relevant to navigation. However, most robotic visual navigation methods rely on deep learning models pre-trained on vision tasks, which prioritize salient objects -- not necessarily relevant to navigation and potentially misleading. Alternative approaches train specialized navigation models from scratch, requiring significant computation. On the other hand, self-supervised learning has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, but its application to robotic navigation remains underexplored due to the difficulty of defining effective self-supervision signals. Motivated by these observations, in this work, we propose a Self-Supervised Vision-Action Model for Visual Navigation Pre-Training (VANP). Instead of detecting salient objects that are beneficial for tasks such as classification or detection, VANP learns to focus only on specific visual regions that are relevant to the navigation task. To achieve this, VANP uses a history of visual observations, future actions, and a goal image for self-supervision, and embeds them using two small Transformer Encoders. Then, VANP maximizes the information between the embeddings by using a mutual information maximization objective function. We demonstrate that most VANP-extracted features match with human navigation intuition. VANP achieves comparable performance as models learned end-to-end with half the training time and models trained on a large-scale, fully supervised dataset, i.e., ImageNet, with only 0.08% data.</description>

      <title>Tightly-Coupled LiDAR-IMU-Wheel Odometry with Online Calibration of a Kinematic Model for Skid-Steering Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunnels and long corridors are challenging environments for mobile robots because a LiDAR point cloud should degenerate in these environments. To tackle point cloud degeneration, this study presents a tightly-coupled LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm with an online calibration for skid-steering robots. We propose a full linear wheel odometry factor, which not only serves as a motion constraint but also performs the online calibration of kinematic models for skid-steering robots. Despite the dynamically changing kinematic model (e.g., wheel radii changes caused by tire pressures) and terrain conditions, our method can address the model error via online calibration. Moreover, our method enables an accurate localization in cases of degenerated environments, such as long and straight corridors, by calibration while the LiDAR-IMU fusion sufficiently operates. Furthermore, we estimate the uncertainty (i.e., covariance matrix) of the wheel odometry online for creating a reasonable constraint. The proposed method is validated through three experiments. The first indoor experiment shows that the proposed method is robust in severe degeneracy cases (long corridors) and changes in the wheel radii. The second outdoor experiment demonstrates that our method accurately estimates the sensor trajectory despite being in rough outdoor terrain owing to online uncertainty estimation of wheel odometry. The third experiment shows the proposed online calibration enables robust odometry estimation in changing terrains.</description>

      <title>Fast Decentralized State Estimation for Legged Robot Locomotion via EKF and MHE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast and decentralized state estimation framework for the control of legged locomotion. The nonlinear estimation of the floating base states is decentralized to an orientation estimation via Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a linear velocity estimation via Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE). The EKF fuses the inertia sensor with vision to estimate the floating base orientation. The MHE uses the estimated orientation with all the sensors within a time window in the past to estimate the linear velocities based on a time-varying linear dynamics formulation of the interested states with state constraints. More importantly, a marginalization method based on the optimization structure of the full information filter (FIF) is proposed to convert the equality-constrained FIF to an equivalent MHE. This decoupling of state estimation promotes the desired balance of computation efficiency, accuracy of estimation, and the inclusion of state constraints. The proposed method is shown to be capable of providing accurate state estimation to several legged robots, including the highly dynamic hopping robot PogoX, the bipedal robot Cassie, and the quadrupedal robot Unitree Go1, with a frequency at 200 Hz and a window interval of 0.1s.</description>

      <title>Region-aware Grasp Framework with Normalized Grasp Space for Efficient 6-DoF Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of region-based methods succeed in extracting regional features and enhancing grasp detection quality. However, faced with a cluttered scene with potential collision, the definition of the grasp-relevant region stays inconsistent, and the relationship between grasps and regional spaces remains incompletely investigated. In this paper, we propose Normalized Grasp Space (NGS) from a novel region-aware viewpoint, unifying the grasp representation within a normalized regional space and benefiting the generalizability of methods. Leveraging the NGS, we find that CNNs are underestimated for 3D feature extraction and 6-DoF grasp detection in clutter scenes and build a highly efficient Region-aware Normalized Grasp Network (RNGNet). Experiments on the public benchmark show that our method achieves significant &gt;20% performance gains while attaining a real-time inference speed of approximately 50 FPS. Real-world cluttered scene clearance experiments underscore the effectiveness of our method. Further, human-to-robot handover and dynamic object grasping experiments demonstrate the potential of our proposed method for closed-loop grasping in dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>FREA: Feasibility-Guided Generation of Safety-Critical Scenarios with Reasonable Adversariality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating safety-critical scenarios, which are essential yet difficult to collect at scale, offers an effective method to evaluate the robustness of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Existing methods focus on optimizing adversariality while preserving the naturalness of scenarios, aiming to achieve a balance through data-driven approaches. However, without an appropriate upper bound for adversariality, the scenarios might exhibit excessive adversariality, potentially leading to unavoidable collisions. In this paper, we introduce FREA, a novel safety-critical scenarios generation method that incorporates the Largest Feasible Region (LFR) of AV as guidance to ensure the reasonableness of the adversarial scenarios. Concretely, FREA initially pre-calculates the LFR of AV from offline datasets. Subsequently, it learns a reasonable adversarial policy that controls the scene's critical background vehicles (CBVs) to generate adversarial yet AV-feasible scenarios by maximizing a novel feasibility-dependent adversarial objective function. Extensive experiments illustrate that FREA can effectively generate safety-critical scenarios, yielding considerable near-miss events while ensuring AV's feasibility. Generalization analysis also confirms the robustness of FREA in AV testing across various surrogate AV methods and traffic environments.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Human-AI Collaboration: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback and Physics Knowledge for Safe Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, developing safe and trustworthy autonomous driving policies remains a significant challenge. Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has attracted substantial attention due to its potential to enhance training safety and sampling efficiency. Nevertheless, existing RLHF-enabled methods often falter when faced with imperfect human demonstrations, potentially leading to training oscillations or even worse performance than rule-based approaches. Inspired by the human learning process, we propose Physics-enhanced Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (PE-RLHF). This novel framework synergistically integrates human feedback (e.g., human intervention and demonstration) and physics knowledge (e.g., traffic flow model) into the training loop of reinforcement learning. The key advantage of PE-RLHF is its guarantee that the learned policy will perform at least as well as the given physics-based policy, even when human feedback quality deteriorates, thus ensuring trustworthy safety improvements. PE-RLHF introduces a Physics-enhanced Human-AI (PE-HAI) collaborative paradigm for dynamic action selection between human and physics-based actions, employs a reward-free approach with a proxy value function to capture human preferences, and incorporates a minimal intervention mechanism to reduce the cognitive load on human mentors. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios demonstrate that PE-RLHF significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in safety, efficiency, and generalizability, even with varying quality of human feedback. The philosophy behind PE-RLHF not only advances autonomous driving technology but can also offer valuable insights for other safety-critical domains.

      <title>TransKD: Transformer Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation benchmarks in the realm of autonomous driving are dominated by large pre-trained transformers, yet their widespread adoption is impeded by substantial computational costs and prolonged training durations. To lift this constraint, we look at efficient semantic segmentation from a perspective of comprehensive knowledge distillation and aim to bridge the gap between multi-source knowledge extractions and transformer-specific patch embeddings. We put forward the Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation (TransKD) framework which learns compact student transformers by distilling both feature maps and patch embeddings of large teacher transformers, bypassing the long pre-training process and reducing the FLOPs by &gt;85.0%. Specifically, we propose two fundamental modules to realize feature map distillation and patch embedding distillation, respectively: (1) Cross Selective Fusion (CSF) enables knowledge transfer between cross-stage features via channel attention and feature map distillation within hierarchical transformers; (2) Patch Embedding Alignment (PEA) performs dimensional transformation within the patchifying process to facilitate the patch embedding distillation. Furthermore, we introduce two optimization modules to enhance the patch embedding distillation from different perspectives: (1) Global-Local Context Mixer (GL-Mixer) extracts both global and local information of a representative embedding; (2) Embedding Assistant (EA) acts as an embedding method to seamlessly bridge teacher and student models with the teacher's number of channels. Experiments on Cityscapes, ACDC, NYUv2, and Pascal VOC2012 datasets show that TransKD outperforms state-of-the-art distillation frameworks and rivals the time-consuming pre-training method.

      <title>Hierarchical Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning with Mid-level Input Generation for Autonomous Driving on Urban Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04823v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deriving robust control policies for realistic urban navigation scenarios is not a trivial task. In an end-to-end approach, these policies must map high-dimensional images from the vehicle's cameras to low-level actions such as steering and throttle. While pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are based exclusively on engineered rewards, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) agents learn from expert demonstrations while interacting with the environment, which favors GAIL on tasks for which a reward signal is difficult to derive, such as autonomous driving. However, training deep networks directly from raw images on RL tasks is known to be unstable and troublesome. To deal with that, this work proposes a hierarchical GAIL-based architecture (hGAIL) which decouples representation learning from the driving task to solve the autonomous navigation of a vehicle. The proposed architecture consists of two modules: a GAN (Generative Adversarial Net) which generates an abstract mid-level input representation, which is the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) from the surroundings of the vehicle; and the GAIL which learns to control the vehicle based on the BEV predictions from the GAN as input. hGAIL is able to learn both the policy and the mid-level representation simultaneously as the agent interacts with the environment. Our experiments made in the CARLA simulation environment have shown that GAIL exclusively from cameras (without BEV) fails to even learn the task, while hGAIL, after training exclusively on one city, was able to autonomously navigate successfully in 98% of the intersections of a new city not used in training phase.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, paving the way for their application in autonomous driving (AD). This survey presents a comprehensive review of more than 40 research papers, demonstrating the role of foundation models in enhancing AD. Large language models contribute to planning and simulation in AD, particularly through their proficiency in reasoning, code generation and translation. In parallel, vision foundation models are increasingly adapted for critical tasks such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as creating realistic driving scenarios for simulation and testing. Multi-modal foundation models, integrating diverse inputs, exhibit exceptional visual understanding and spatial reasoning, crucial for end-to-end AD. This survey not only provides a structured taxonomy, categorizing foundation models based on their modalities and functionalities within the AD domain but also delves into the methods employed in current research. It identifies the gaps between existing foundation models and cutting-edge AD approaches, thereby charting future research directions and proposing a roadmap for bridging these gaps.</description>

      <title>Online Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery with Task Deadlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Managing delivery deadlines in automated warehouses and factories is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring seamless production. This study introduces the problem of online multi-agent pickup and delivery with task deadlines (MAPD-D), an advanced variant of the online MAPD problem incorporating delivery deadlines. In the MAPD problem, agents must manage a continuous stream of delivery tasks online. Tasks are added at any time. Agents must complete their tasks while avoiding collisions with each other. MAPD-D introduces a dynamic, deadline-driven approach that incorporates task deadlines, challenging the conventional MAPD frameworks. To tackle MAPD-D, we propose a novel algorithm named deadline-aware token passing (D-TP). The D-TP algorithm calculates pickup deadlines and assigns tasks while balancing execution cost and deadline proximity. Additionally, we introduce the D-TP with task swaps (D-TPTS) method to further reduce task tardiness, enhancing flexibility and efficiency through task-swapping strategies. Numerical experiments were conducted in simulated warehouse environments to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Both D-TP and D-TPTS demonstrated significant reductions in task tardiness compared to existing methods. Our methods contribute to efficient operations in automated warehouses and factories with delivery deadlines.</description>

      <title>MCDS-VSS: Moving Camera Dynamic Scene Video Semantic Segmentation by Filtering with Self-Supervised Geometry and Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, rely on reliable semantic environment perception for decision making. Despite great advances in video semantic segmentation, existing approaches ignore important inductive biases and lack structured and interpretable internal representations. In this work, we propose MCDS-VSS, a structured filter model that learns in a self-supervised manner to estimate scene geometry and ego-motion of the camera, while also estimating the motion of external objects. Our model leverages these representations to improve the temporal consistency of semantic segmentation without sacrificing segmentation accuracy. MCDS-VSS follows a prediction-fusion approach in which scene geometry and camera motion are first used to compensate for ego-motion, then residual flow is used to compensate motion of dynamic objects, and finally the predicted scene features are fused with the current features to obtain a temporally consistent scene segmentation. Our model parses automotive scenes into multiple decoupled interpretable representations such as scene geometry, ego-motion, and object motion. Quantitative evaluation shows that MCDS-VSS achieves superior temporal consistency on video sequences while retaining competitive segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>BEVal: A Cross-dataset Evaluation Study of BEV Segmentation Models for Autononomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current research in semantic bird's-eye view segmentation for autonomous driving focuses solely on optimizing neural network models using a single dataset, typically nuScenes. This practice leads to the development of highly specialized models that may fail when faced with different environments or sensor setups, a problem known as domain shift. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation of state-of-the-art BEV segmentation models to assess their performance across different training and testing datasets and setups, as well as different semantic categories. We investigate the influence of different sensors, such as cameras and LiDAR, on the models' ability to generalize to diverse conditions and scenarios. Additionally, we conduct multi-dataset training experiments that improve models' BEV segmentation performance compared to single-dataset training. Our work addresses the gap in evaluating BEV segmentation models under cross-dataset validation. And our findings underscore the importance of enhancing model generalizability and adaptability to ensure more robust and reliable BEV segmentation approaches for autonomous driving applications.

      <title>Deep Neural Implicit Representation of Accessibility for Multi-Axis Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main concerns in design and process planning for multi-axis additive and subtractive manufacturing is collision avoidance between moving objects (e.g., tool assemblies) and stationary objects (e.g., a part unified with fixtures). The collision measure for various pairs of relative rigid translations and rotations between the two pointsets can be conceptualized by a compactly supported scalar field over the 6D non-Euclidean configuration space. Explicit representation and computation of this field is costly in both time and space. If we fix $O(m)$ sparsely sampled rotations (e.g., tool orientations), computation of the collision measure field as a convolution of indicator functions of the 3D pointsets over a uniform grid (i.e., voxelized geometry) of resolution $O(n^3)$ via fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) scales as in $O(mn^3 \log n)$ in time and $O(mn^3)$ in space. In this paper, we develop an implicit representation of the collision measure field via deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our approach is able to accurately interpolate the collision measure from a sparse sampling of rotations, and can represent the collision measure field with a small memory footprint. Moreover, we show that this representation can be efficiently updated through fine-tuning to more efficiently train the network on multi-resolution data, as well as accommodate incremental changes to the geometry (such as might occur in iterative processes such as topology optimization of the part subject to CNC tool accessibility constraints).</description>

      <title>Deep Brain Ultrasound Ablation Thermal Dose Modeling with in Vivo Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracorporeal needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU) is a minimally invasive option for intervening in malignant brain tumors, commonly used in thermal ablation procedures. This technique is suitable for both primary and metastatic cancers, utilizing a high-frequency alternating electric field (up to 10 MHz) to excite a piezoelectric transducer. The resulting rapid deformation of the transducer produces an acoustic wave that propagates through tissue, leading to localized high-temperature heating at the target tumor site and inducing rapid cell death. To optimize the design of NBTU transducers for thermal dose delivery during treatment, numerical modeling of the acoustic pressure field generated by the deforming piezoelectric transducer is frequently employed. The bioheat transfer process generated by the input pressure field is used to track the thermal propagation of the applicator over time. Magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI) can be used to experimentally validate these models. Validation results using MRTI demonstrated the feasibility of this model, showing a consistent thermal propagation pattern. However, a thermal damage isodose map is more advantageous for evaluating therapeutic efficacy. To achieve a more accurate simulation based on the actual brain tissue environment, a new finite element method (FEM) simulation with enhanced damage evaluation capabilities was conducted. The results showed that the highest temperature and ablated volume differed between experimental and simulation results by 2.1884{\deg}C (3.71%) and 0.0631 cm$^3$ (5.74%), respectively. The lowest Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for peak temperature was 0.7117, and the lowest Dice coefficient for the ablated area was 0.7021, indicating a good agreement in accuracy between simulation and experiment.</description>
