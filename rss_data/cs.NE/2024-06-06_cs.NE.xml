      <title>Exploiting Chaotic Dynamics as Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos presents complex dynamics arising from nonlinearity and a sensitivity to initial states. These characteristics suggest a depth of expressivity that underscores their potential for advanced computational applications. However, strategies to effectively exploit chaotic dynamics for information processing have largely remained elusive. In this study, we reveal that the essence of chaos can be found in various state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Drawing inspiration from this revelation, we propose a novel method that directly leverages chaotic dynamics for deep learning architectures. Our approach is systematically evaluated across distinct chaotic systems. In all instances, our framework presents superior results to conventional deep neural networks in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and efficiency. Furthermore, we found an active role of transient chaos formation in our scheme. Collectively, this study offers a new path for the integration of chaos, which has long been overlooked in information processing, and provides insights into the prospective fusion of chaotic dynamics within the domains of machine learning and neuromorphic computation.</description>

      <title>Maintaining Diversity Provably Helps in Evolutionary Multimodal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the real world, there exist a class of optimization problems that multiple (local) optimal solutions in the solution space correspond to a single point in the objective space. In this paper, we theoretically show that for such multimodal problems, a simple method that considers the diversity of solutions in the solution space can benefit the search in evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Specifically, we prove that the proposed method, working with crossover, can help enhance the exploration, leading to polynomial or even exponential acceleration on the expected running time. This result is derived by rigorous running time analysis in both single-objective and multi-objective scenarios, including $(\mu+1)$-GA solving the widely studied single-objective problem, Jump, and NSGA-II and SMS-EMOA (two well-established multi-objective EAs) solving the widely studied bi-objective problem, OneJumpZeroJump. Experiments are also conducted to validate the theoretical results. We hope that our results may encourage the exploration of diversity maintenance in the solution space for multi-objective optimization, where existing EAs usually only consider the diversity in the objective space and can easily be trapped in local optima.</description>

      <title>Discovering Dynamic Symbolic Policies with Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being applied to solve control problems. However, control systems developed in AI are often black-box methods, in that it is not clear how and why they generate their outputs. A lack of transparency can be problematic for control tasks in particular, because it complicates the identification of biases or errors, which in turn negatively influences the user's confidence in the system. To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, the black-box structure can be replaced with white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. Genetic programming offers a gradient-free method to optimise the structure of non-differentiable mathematical expressions. In this paper, we show that genetic programming can be used to discover symbolic control systems. This is achieved by learning a symbolic representation of a function that transforms observations into control signals. We consider both systems that implement static control policies without memory and systems that implement dynamic memory-based control policies. In case of the latter, the discovered function becomes the state equation of a differential equation, which allows for evidence integration. Our results show that symbolic policies are discovered that perform comparably with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the additional value of the memory capacity in the dynamic policies is demonstrated on experiments where static policies fall short. Overall, we demonstrate that white-box symbolic policies can be optimised with genetic programming, while offering interpretability and transparency that lacks in black-box models.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Spiking Neural Networks as State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are posited as a biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural architectures, with their core computational framework resting on the extensively studied leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron design. The stateful nature of LIF neurons has spurred ongoing discussions about the ability of SNNs to process sequential data, akin to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite this, there remains a significant gap in the exploration of current SNNs within the realm of long-range dependency tasks. In this study, to extend the analysis of neuronal dynamics beyond simplistic LIF mechanism, we present a novel class of stochastic spiking neuronal model grounded in state space models. We expand beyond the scalar hidden state representation of LIF neurons, which traditionally comprises only the membrane potential, by proposing an n-dimensional hidden state. Additionally, we enable fine-tuned formulation of neuronal dynamics across each layer by introducing learnable parameters, as opposed to the fixed dynamics in LIF neurons. We also develop a robust framework for scaling these neuronal models to deep SNN-based architectures, ensuring efficient parallel training while also adeptly addressing the challenge of non-differentiability of stochastic spiking operation during the backward phase. Our models attain state-of-the-art performance among SNN models across diverse long-range dependency tasks, encompassing the Long Range Arena benchmark, permuted sequential MNIST, and the Speech Command dataset. Moreover, we provide an analysis of the energy efficiency advantages, emphasizing the sparse activity pattern intrinsic to this spiking model.</description>

      <title>When Spiking neural networks meet temporal attention image decoding and adaptive spiking neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are capable of encoding and processing temporal information in a biologically plausible way. However, most existing SNN-based methods for image tasks do not fully exploit this feature. Moreover, they often overlook the role of adaptive threshold in spiking neurons, which can enhance their dynamic behavior and learning ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for image decoding based on temporal attention (TAID) and an adaptive Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (ALIF) neuron model. Our method leverages the temporal information of SNN outputs to generate high-quality images that surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of Inception score, Fr\'echet Inception Distance, and Fr\'echet Autoencoder Distance. Furthermore, our ALIF neuron model achieves remarkable classification accuracy on MNIST (99.78\%) and CIFAR-10 (93.89\%) datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning adaptive thresholds for spiking neurons. The code is available at https://github.com/bollossom/ICLR_TINY_SNN.</description>

      <title>Spiking representation learning for associative memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of interconnected neurons communicating through spiking signals offer the bedrock of neural computations. Our brains spiking neural networks have the computational capacity to achieve complex pattern recognition and cognitive functions effortlessly. However, solving real-world problems with artificial spiking neural networks (SNNs) has proved to be difficult for a variety of reasons. Crucially, scaling SNNs to large networks and processing large-scale real-world datasets have been challenging, especially when compared to their non-spiking deep learning counterparts. The critical operation that is needed of SNNs is the ability to learn distributed representations from data and use these representations for perceptual, cognitive and memory operations. In this work, we introduce a novel SNN that performs unsupervised representation learning and associative memory operations leveraging Hebbian synaptic and activity-dependent structural plasticity coupled with neuron-units modelled as Poisson spike generators with sparse firing (~1 Hz mean and ~100 Hz maximum firing rate). Crucially, the architecture of our model derives from the neocortical columnar organization and combines feedforward projections for learning hidden representations and recurrent projections for forming associative memories. We evaluated the model on properties relevant for attractor-based associative memories such as pattern completion, perceptual rivalry, distortion resistance, and prototype extraction.</description>

      <title>SpikeLM: Towards General Spike-Driven Language Modeling via Elastic Bi-Spiking Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence similar to the human brain, the bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages of biological plausibility, event-driven sparsity, and binary activation. Recently, large-scale language models exhibit promising generalization capability, making it a valuable issue to explore more general spike-driven models. However, the binary spikes in existing SNNs fail to encode adequate semantic information, placing technological challenges for generalization. This work proposes the first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks, including both discriminative and generative ones. Different from previous spikes with {0,1} levels, we propose a more general spike formulation with bi-directional, elastic amplitude, and elastic frequency encoding, while still maintaining the addition nature of SNNs. In a single time step, the spike is enhanced by direction and amplitude information; in spike frequency, a strategy to control spike firing rate is well designed. We plug this elastic bi-spiking mechanism in language modeling, named SpikeLM. It is the first time to handle general language tasks with fully spike-driven models, which achieve much higher accuracy than previously possible. SpikeLM also greatly bridges the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xingrun-Xing/SpikeLM.</description>

      <title>SpikeZIP-TF: Conversion is All You Need for Transformer-based SNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has attracted great attention due to its characteristic of high efficiency and accuracy. Currently, the ANN-to-SNN conversion methods can obtain ANN on-par accuracy SNN with ultra-low latency (8 time-steps) in CNN structure on computer vision (CV) tasks. However, as Transformer-based networks have achieved prevailing precision on both CV and natural language processing (NLP), the Transformer-based SNNs are still encounting the lower accuracy w.r.t the ANN counterparts. In this work, we introduce a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion method called SpikeZIP-TF, where ANN and SNN are exactly equivalent, thus incurring no accuracy degradation. SpikeZIP-TF achieves 83.82% accuracy on CV dataset (ImageNet) and 93.79% accuracy on NLP dataset (SST-2), which are higher than SOTA Transformer-based SNNs.

      <title>CoNO: Complex Neural Operator for Continous Dynamical Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators extend data-driven models to map between infinite-dimensional functional spaces. While these operators perform effectively in either the time or frequency domain, their performance may be limited when applied to non-stationary spatial or temporal signals whose frequency characteristics change with time. Here, we introduce Complex Neural Operator (CoNO) that parameterizes the integral kernel using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), better representing non-stationary signals in a complex-valued domain. Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Gated recurrent neural network with TPE Bayesian optimization for enhancing stock index prediction accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of deep learning architectures, neural networks, and the combination of abundant financial data and powerful computers are transforming finance, leading us to develop an advanced method for predicting future stock prices. However, the accessibility of investment and trading at everyone's fingertips made the stock markets increasingly intricate and prone to volatility. The increased complexity and volatility of the stock market have driven demand for more models, which would effectively capture high volatility and non-linear behavior of the different stock prices. This study explored gated recurrent neural network (GRNN) algorithms such as LSTM (long short-term memory), GRU (gated recurrent unit), and hybrid models like GRU-LSTM, LSTM-GRU, with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter optimization (TPE-GRNN). The aim is to improve the prediction accuracy of the next day's closing price of the NIFTY 50 index, a prominent Indian stock market index, using TPE-GRNN. A combination of eight influential factors is carefully chosen from fundamental stock data, technical indicators, crude oil price, and macroeconomic data to train the models for capturing the changes in the price of the index with the factors of the broader economy. Single-layer and multi-layer TPE-GRNN models have been developed. The models' performance is evaluated using standard matrices like R2, MAPE, and RMSE. The analysis of models' performance reveals the impact of feature selection and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in enhancing stock index price prediction accuracy. The results show that the MAPE of our proposed TPE-LSTM method is the lowest (best) with respect to all the previous models for stock index price prediction.</description>

      <title>Oscillations enhance time-series prediction in reservoir computing with feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing, a machine learning framework used for modeling the brain, can predict temporal data with little observations and minimal computational resources. However, it is difficult to accurately reproduce the long-term target time series because the reservoir system becomes unstable. This predictive capability is required for a wide variety of time-series processing, including predictions of motor timing and chaotic dynamical systems. This study proposes oscillation-driven reservoir computing (ODRC) with feedback, where oscillatory signals are fed into a reservoir network to stabilize the network activity and induce complex reservoir dynamics. The ODRC can reproduce long-term target time series more accurately than conventional reservoir computing methods in a motor timing and chaotic time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, it generates a time series similar to the target in the unexperienced period, that is, it can learn the abstract generative rules from limited observations. Given these significant improvements made by the simple and computationally inexpensive implementation, the ODRC would serve as a practical model of various time series data. Moreover, we will discuss biological implications of the ODRC, considering it as a model of neural oscillations and their cerebellar processors.</description>

      <title>Text Injection for Neural Contextual Biasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural contextual biasing effectively improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) for crucial phrases within a speaker's context, particularly those that are infrequent in the training data. This work proposes contextual text injection (CTI) to enhance contextual ASR. CTI leverages not only the paired speech-text data, but also a much larger corpus of unpaired text to optimize the ASR model and its biasing component. Unpaired text is converted into speech-like representations and used to guide the model's attention towards relevant bias phrases. Moreover, we introduce a contextual text-injected (CTI) minimum word error rate (MWER) training, which minimizes the expected WER caused by contextual biasing when unpaired text is injected into the model. Experiments show that CTI with 100 billion text sentences can achieve up to 43.3% relative WER reduction from a strong neural biasing model. CTI-MWER provides a further relative improvement of 23.5%.</description>

      <title>Pruner-Zero: Evolving Symbolic Pruning Metric from scratch for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to their extensive size. Pruning methods drop a subset of weights to accelerate, but many of them require retraining, which is prohibitively expensive and computationally demanding. Recently, post-training pruning approaches introduced novel metrics, enabling the pruning of LLMs without retraining. However, these metrics require the involvement of human experts and tedious trial and error. To efficiently identify superior pruning metrics, we develop an automatic framework for searching symbolic pruning metrics using genetic programming. In particular, we devise an elaborate search space encompassing the existing pruning metrics to discover the potential symbolic pruning metric. We propose an opposing operation simplification strategy to increase the diversity of the population. In this way, Pruner-Zero allows auto-generation of symbolic pruning metrics. Based on the searched results, we explore the correlation between pruning metrics and performance after pruning and summarize some principles. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 on language modeling and zero-shot tasks demonstrate that our Pruner-Zero obtains superior performance than SOTA post-training pruning methods.

      <title>The Task-oriented Queries Benchmark (ToQB)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented queries (e.g., one-shot queries to play videos, order food, or call a taxi) are crucial for assessing the quality of virtual assistants, chatbots, and other large language model (LLM)-based services. However, a standard benchmark for task-oriented queries is not yet available, as existing benchmarks in the relevant NLP (Natural Language Processing) fields have primarily focused on task-oriented dialogues. Thus, we present a new methodology for efficiently generating the Task-oriented Queries Benchmark (ToQB) using existing task-oriented dialogue datasets and an LLM service. Our methodology involves formulating the underlying NLP task to summarize the original intent of a speaker in each dialogue, detailing the key steps to perform the devised NLP task using an LLM service, and outlining a framework for automating a major part of the benchmark generation process. Through a case study encompassing three domains (i.e., two single-task domains and one multi-task domain), we demonstrate how to customize the LLM prompts (e.g., omitting system utterances or speaker labels) for those three domains and characterize the generated task-oriented queries. The generated ToQB dataset is made available to the public. We further discuss new domains that can be added to ToQB by community contributors and its practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computation models form a subclass of recurrent neural networks with fixed non-trainable input and dynamic coupling weights. Only the static readout from the state space (reservoir) is trainable, thus avoiding the known problems with propagation of gradient information backwards through time. Reservoir models have been successfully applied in a variety of tasks and were shown to be universal approximators of time-invariant fading memory dynamic filters under various settings. Simple cycle reservoirs (SCR) have been suggested as severely restricted reservoir architecture, with equal weight ring connectivity of the reservoir units and input-to-reservoir weights of binary nature with the same absolute value. Such architectures are well suited for hardware implementations without performance degradation in many practical tasks. In this contribution, we rigorously study the expressive power of SCR in the complex domain and show that they are capable of universal approximation of any unrestricted linear reservoir system (with continuous readout) and hence any time-invariant fading memory filter over uniformly bounded input streams.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as In-context AI Generators for Quality-Diversity</title>

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) approaches are a promising direction to develop open-ended processes as they can discover archives of high-quality solutions across diverse niches. While already successful in many applications, QD approaches usually rely on combining only one or two solutions to generate new candidate solutions. As observed in open-ended processes such as technological evolution, wisely combining large diversity of these solutions could lead to more innovative solutions and potentially boost the productivity of QD search. In this work, we propose to exploit the pattern-matching capabilities of generative models to enable such efficient solution combinations. We introduce In-context QD, a framework of techniques that aim to elicit the in-context capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interesting solutions using few-shot and many-shot prompting with quality-diverse examples from the QD archive as context. Applied to a series of common QD domains, In-context QD displays promising results compared to both QD baselines and similar strategies developed for single-objective optimization. Additionally, this result holds across multiple values of parameter sizes and archive population sizes, as well as across domains with distinct characteristics from BBO functions to policy search. Finally, we perform an extensive ablation that highlights the key prompt design considerations that encourage the generation of promising solutions for QD.</description>

      <title>Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism found in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological realism and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</description>

      <title>Universality of Linear Recurrences Followed by Non-linear Projections: Finite-Width Guarantees and Benefits of Complex Eigenvalues</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks based on linear RNNs interleaved with position-wise MLPs are gaining traction as competitive approaches for sequence modeling. Examples of such architectures include state-space models (SSMs) like S4, LRU, and Mamba: recently proposed models that achieve promising performance on text, genetics, and other data that require long-range reasoning. Despite experimental evidence highlighting these architectures' effectiveness and computational efficiency, their expressive power remains relatively unexplored, especially in connection to specific choices crucial in practice - e.g., carefully designed initialization distribution and potential use of complex numbers. In this paper, we show that combining MLPs with both real or complex linear diagonal recurrences leads to arbitrarily precise approximation of regular causal sequence-to-sequence maps. At the heart of our proof, we rely on a separation of concerns: the linear RNN provides a lossless encoding of the input sequence, and the MLP performs non-linear processing on this encoding. While we show that real diagonal linear recurrences are enough to achieve universality in this architecture, we prove that employing complex eigenvalues near unit disk - i.e., empirically the most successful strategy in S4 - greatly helps the RNN in storing information. We connect this finding with the vanishing gradient issue and provide experiments supporting our claims.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Distance Filtering for Graph Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks based on iterative one-hop message passing have been shown to struggle in harnessing the information from distant nodes effectively. Conversely, graph transformers allow each node to attend to all other nodes directly, but lack graph inductive bias and have to rely on ad-hoc positional encoding. In this paper, we propose a new architecture to reconcile these challenges. Our approach stems from the recent breakthroughs in long-range modeling provided by deep state-space models: for a given target node, our model aggregates other nodes by their shortest distances to the target and uses a linear RNN to encode the sequence of hop representations. The linear RNN is parameterized in a particular diagonal form for stable long-range signal propagation and is theoretically expressive enough to encode the neighborhood hierarchy. With no need for positional encoding, we empirically show that the performance of our model is comparable to or better than that of state-of-the-art graph transformers on various benchmarks, with a significantly reduced computational cost.

      <title>Future Directions in the Theory of Graph Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs), has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.</description>

      <title>BanglaAutoKG: Automatic Bangla Knowledge Graph Construction with Semantic Neural Graph Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proven essential in information processing and reasoning applications because they link related entities and give context-rich information, supporting efficient information retrieval and knowledge discovery; presenting information flow in a very effective manner. Despite being widely used globally, Bangla is relatively underrepresented in KGs due to a lack of comprehensive datasets, encoders, NER (named entity recognition) models, POS (part-of-speech) taggers, and lemmatizers, hindering efficient information processing and reasoning applications in the language. Addressing the KG scarcity in Bengali, we propose BanglaAutoKG, a pioneering framework that is able to automatically construct Bengali KGs from any Bangla text. We utilize multilingual LLMs to understand various languages and correlate entities and relations universally. By employing a translation dictionary to identify English equivalents and extracting word features from pre-trained BERT models, we construct the foundational KG. To reduce noise and align word embeddings with our goal, we employ graph-based polynomial filters. Lastly, we implement a GNN-based semantic filter, which elevates contextual understanding and trims unnecessary edges, culminating in the formation of the definitive KG. Empirical findings and case studies demonstrate the universal effectiveness of our model, capable of autonomously constructing semantically enriched KGs from any text.</description>
