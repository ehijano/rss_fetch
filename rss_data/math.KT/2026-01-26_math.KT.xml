      <title>Duality for graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known and old result of Hazewinkel and Koszul states that the cohomology of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra is isomorphic, up to a suitable shift, to its twisted homology, a Lie-theoretical version of Poincare duality. This paper establishes an analogue of this result for graded (or super) Lie algebras and, more generally, differential graded Lie algebras.
  Closely related to this result is a calculation of the cohomology of a graded Lie algebra g with coefficients in its universal enveloping algebra U(g) as a one-sided module. This cohomology turns out to be one-dimensional and serves as a dualizing module for the cohomology of g. Moreover, it is shown that for a unimodular graded Lie algebra g, the derived category of U(g) has a Calabi-Yau structure. As a consequence, the category of rational infinity local systems on a simply connected topological space with totally finite-dimensional rational homotopy groups, has a Calabi-Yau structure, a generalization of Poincare duality for elliptic spaces.</description>

      <title>An extension of Steinberg's Theorem to biquotient pairs of subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the derived tensor product of the representation rings of subgroups of a given compact Lie group G. That is, given two such subgroups H_1 and H_2, we study the tensor product of the associated representation rings R(H_1) and R(H_2) over the representation ring RG, and prove a vanishing result for the associated higher Tor-groups. This result can be viewed as a natural generalization of the Theorem of Steinberg that asserts that the representation rings of maximal rank subgroups of G are free over RG. It my also be viewed as an analogue of a result of Singhof on the cohomology of classifying spaces. We include an immediate application to the complex K-theory of biquotient manifolds.</description>

      <title>On P^1-stabilization in unstable motivic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze stabilization with respect to ${\mathbb P}^1$ in the Morel--Voevodsky unstable motivic homotopy theory. We introduce a refined notion of cellularity (a.k.a., biconnectivity) in various motivic homotopy categories taking into account both the simplicial and Tate circles. Under suitable cellularity hypotheses, we refine the Whitehead theorem by showing that a map of nilpotent motivic spaces can be seen to be an equivalence if it so after taking (Voevodsky) motives. We then establish a version of the Freudenthal suspension theorem for ${\mathbb P}^1$-suspension, again under suitable cellularity hypotheses. As applications, we resolve Murthy's conjecture on splitting of corank $1$ vector bundles on smooth affine algebras over algebraically closed fields having characteristic $0$ and compute new unstable motivic homotopy of motivic spheres.</description>
