      <title>Memory Effects in Disease Modelling Through Kernel Estimates with Oscillatory Time History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a linear chain trick algorithm for dynamical systems for which we have oscillatory time histories in the distributed time delay. We make use of this algorithmic framework to analyse memory effects in disease evolution in a population. The modelling is based on a susceptible-infected-recovered SIR - model and on a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered SEIR - model through a kernel that dampens the activity based on the recent history of infectious individuals. This corresponds to adaptive behavior in the population or through governmental non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use the linear chain trick to show that such a model may be written in a Markovian way, and we analyze the stability of the system. We find that the adaptive behavior gives rise to either a stable equilibrium point or a stable limit cycle for a close to constant number of susceptibles, i.e.\ locally in time. We also show that the attack rate for this model is lower than it would be without the dampening, although the adaptive behavior disappears as time goes to infinity and the number of infected goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Fitness inference tested by in silico population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider populations evolving according to natural selection, mutation, and recombination, and assume that the genomes of all or a representative selection of individuals are known. We pose the problem if it is possible to infer fitness parameters and genotype fitness order from such data. We tested this hypothesis in simulated populations. We delineate parameter ranges where this is possible and other ranges where it is not.Our work provides a framework for determining when fitness inference is feasible from population-wide, whole-genome, time-stratified data and highlights settings where it is not. We give a brief survey of biological model organisms and human pathogens that fit into this framework.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sequential therapies to maximize extinction of resistant bacteria through collateral sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities, where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how longer therapies maximize extinction but also cause higher resistance, leading to a Pareto front of optimal switching periods. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.</description>
