      <title>Large Impact Features on Ganymede and Callisto as Revealed by Geological Mapping and Morphometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed topographic and geological mapping of 19 large impact features on Ganymede and Callisto in order to gather morphometric and crater age data that allow us to quantify how the diverse morphologies of these features transition with size and age. The impact features are divided into two main morphological groups, craters and penepalimpsests/palimpsests. The morphologies of pit and dome craters are independent of age or geologic context, indicating that the impacts that formed them were small enough to only ever penetrate into a cold, rigid ice layer, with evolution of a pocket of impact melt contributing to the development of their central pits and surrounding raised annuli, while the domes formed mainly via viscous relaxation of the pit topography. The subdued rims of anomalous dome craters indicate the increasing effect of a warm subsurface ice layer on impact feature morphology with increasing size. The low topographic relief of penepalimpsests and palimpsests indicates that these impacts penetrated the ice shell to liberate large volumes of underlying, pre-existing liquid. Penepalimpsests show a higher frequency of concentric ridges within their interiors, indicating a more robust subsurface state that could support the rotation and uplift of solid material during impact. The size and age overlap of anomalous dome craters, penepalimpsests, and palimpsests, with a few impact features appearing to be transitional between anomalous dome craters and penepalimpsests, indicates that impactor size, time of impact, and variation in temperature gradient across the satellite are all factors in determining which of these morphologies emerges.</description>

      <title>Characterization of starspots on a young M-dwarf K2-25: multi-band observations of stellar photometric variability and planetary transits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed atmospheric characterization of exoplanets by transmission spectroscopy requires careful consideration of stellar surface inhomogeneities induced by starspots. This effect is particularly problematic for planetary systems around M-dwarfs, and their spot properties are not fully understood. We investigated the stellar activity of the young M-dwarf K2-25 and its effect on transit observations of the sub-Neptune K2-25b. From multi-band monitoring observations of stellar brightness variability using ground-based telescopes and TESS, we found that the temperature difference between the spots and photosphere is &lt;190 K and the spot covering fraction is &lt;61% (2$\sigma$). We also investigated the effect of starspot activity using multi-epoch, multi-band transit observations. We rule out cases with extremely low spot temperatures and large spot covering fractions. The results suggest that spots could distort the transmission spectrum of K2-25b by as much as $\sim$100 ppm amplitude, corresponding to the precision of JWST/NIRSPEC of the target. Our study demonstrates that simultaneous multi-band observations with current instruments can constrain the spot properties of M-dwarfs with good enough precision to support atmospheric studies of young M-dwarf planets via transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A Gap in the Densities of Small Planets Orbiting M Dwarfs: Rigorous Statistical Confirmation Using the Open-source Code RhoPop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using mass-radius-composition models, small planets ($\mathrm{R}\lesssim 2 \mathrm{R_\oplus}$) are typically classified into three types: iron-rich, nominally Earth-like, and those with solid/liquid water and/or atmosphere. These classes are generally expected to be variations within a compositional continuum. Recently, however, Luque &amp; Pall\'e observed that potentially Earth-like planets around M dwarfs are separated from a lower-density population by a density gap. Meanwhile, the results of Adibekyan et al. hint that iron-rich planets around FGK stars are also a distinct population. It therefore remains unclear whether small planets represent a continuum or multiple distinct populations. Differentiating the nature of these populations will help constrain potential formation mechanisms. We present the RhoPop software for identifying small-planet populations. RhoPop employs mixture models in a hierarchical framework and a nested sampler for parameter and evidence estimates. Using RhoPop, we confirm the two populations of Luque &amp; Pall\'e with $&gt;4\sigma$ significance. The intrinsic scatter in the Earth-like subpopulation is roughly half that expected based on stellar abundance variations in local FGK stars, perhaps implying M dwarfs have a smaller spread in the major rock-building elements (Fe, Mg, Si) than FGK stars. We apply RhoPop to the Adibekyan et al. sample and find no evidence of more than one population. We estimate the sample size required to resolve a population of planets with Mercury-like compositions from those with Earth-like compositions for various mass-radius precisions. Only 16 planets are needed when $\sigma_{M_p} = 5\%$ and $\sigma_{R_p} = 1\%$. At $\sigma_{M_p} = 10\%$ and $\sigma_{R_p} = 2.5\%$, however, over 154 planets are needed, an order of magnitude increase.</description>

      <title>Mass supply from Io to Jupiter's magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the Voyager mission flybys in 1979, we have known the moon Io to be extremely volcanically active as well as to be the main source of plasma in the vast magnetosphere of Jupiter. Material lost from Io forms neutral clouds, the Io plasma torus and ultimately the extended plasma sheet. This material is supplied from the upper atmosphere and atmospheric loss is likely driven by plasma-interaction effects with possible contributions from thermal escape and photochemistry-driven escape. Direct volcanic escape is negligible. The supply of material to maintain the plasma torus was estimated from various methods at roughly one ton per second. Most of the time the magnetospheric plasma environment of Io is stable on timescales from days to months. Similarly, Io's atmosphere was found to have a stable average density on the dayside, although it exhibits lateral, diurnal and seasonal variations. There is a potential positive feedback in the Io torus supply: collisions of torus plasma with atmospheric neutrals likely are a significant loss process, which increases with torus density. The stability of the torus environment might be maintained by limiting mechanisms of either torus supply from Io or the loss from the torus by centrifugal interchange in the middle magnetosphere. Various observations suggest that occasionally the plasma torus undergoes major transient changes over a period of several weeks, apparently overcoming possible stabilizing mechanisms. Such events (and more frequent minor changes) are commonly explained by some kind of change in volcanic activity that triggers a chain of reactions which modify the plasma torus state via a net increase in supply of new mass. However, it remains unknown what kind of volcanic event can trigger torus events, whether Io's atmosphere undergoes a change before or during such magnetospheric events, and what processes could enable such a change.</description>

      <title>An Agnostic Biosignature Based on Modeling Panspermia and Terraformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental goal of astrobiology is to detect life outside of Earth. This proves to be an exceptional challenge outside of our solar system, where strong assumptions must be made about how life would manifest and interact with its planet. Such assumptions are required because of the lack of a consensus theory of living systems, or an understanding of the possible extent of planetary dynamics. Here we explore a model of life spreading between planetary systems via panspermia and terraformation. Our model shows that as life propagates across the galaxy, correlations emerge between planetary characteristics and location, and can function as a population-scale agnostic biosignature. This biosignature is agnostic because it is independent of strong assumptions about any particular instantiation of life or planetary characteristic--by focusing on a specific hypothesis of what life may do, rather than what life may be. By clustering planets based on their observed characteristics, and examining the spatial extent of these clusters, we demonstrate (and evaluate) a way to prioritize specific planets for further observation--based on their potential for containing life. We consider obstacles that must be overcome to practically implement our approach, including identifying specific ways in which better understanding astrophysical and planetary processes would improve our ability to detect life. Finally, we consider how this model leads us to think in novel ways about hierarchies of life and planetary scale replication.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XIII: Aligned Disks with Non-Settled Dust Around the Newly Resolved Class 0 Protobinary R CrA IRAS 32</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young protostellar binary systems, with expected ages less than $\sim$10$^5$ years, are little modified since birth, providing key clues to binary formation and evolution. We present a first look at the young, Class 0 binary protostellar system R CrA IRAS 32 from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) ALMA large program, which observed the system in the 1.3 mm continuum emission, $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and nine other molecular lines that trace disk, envelope, shocks, and outflows. With a continuum resolution of $\sim$0.03$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$5 au, at a distance of 150 pc), we characterize the newly discovered binary system with a separation of 207 au, their circumstellar disks, and a circumbinary disk-like structure. The circumstellar disk radii are 26.9$\pm$0.3 and 22.8$\pm$0.3 au for sources A and B, respectively, and their circumstellar disk dust masses are estimated as 22.5$\pm$1.1 and 12.4$\pm$0.6 M$_{\Earth}$. The circumstellar disks and the circumbinary structure have well aligned position angles and inclinations, indicating formation in a smooth, ordered process such as disk fragmentation. In addition, the circumstellar disks have a near/far-side asymmetry in the continuum emission suggesting that the dust has yet to settle into a thin layer near the midplane. Spectral analysis of CO isotopologues reveals outflows that originate from both of the sources and possibly from the circumbinary disk-like structure. Furthermore, we detect Keplerian rotation in the $^{13}$CO isotopologues toward both circumstellar disks and likely Keplerian rotation in the circumbinary structure; the latter suggests that it is probably a circumbinary disk.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Black Holes and Dark Matter Clumps in the Solar System with Gravimeter and GNSS Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and gravimeters on Earth and in space can potentially offer the most accurate direct measurement of local density of near-Earth asteroid-mass Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and Dark Matter (DM) clumps in the solar system by means of gravitational influence. Using semi-analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper revisits the analysis of the trajectories of DM clumps in the solar system, including both captured objects and hyperbolic trajectories. A link is thus made between the frequency and distance of Earth overflights for a given mass flux, and a direct measure of dark matter clump density in the solar system. We then model the signature of a close flyby of a DM object on orbital data from GNSS satellites and gravity measurements from gravimeters. We thus obtain a first assessment of the single probe sensitivity. It paves the way for an exhaustive statistical analysis of 28 years of gravimeters and GNSS data to obtain observational constraints on the density of the PBHs and DM clumps within the solar system, for the mass range $[10^8-10^{17}]$ kg. In addition, our methodology offers a possibility of direct detection in cases where DM clumps are endowed with an additional long-range clump-matter fifth-force beyond gravity.</description>

      <title>Day-night transport induced chemistry and clouds on WASP-39b I: Gas-phase composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has recently detected the first robust photochemical product on an exoplanet: sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) on WASP-39b (Rustamkulov et al. 2023; Alderson et al. 2023; Tsai et al. 2023b). The data from the NIRISS instrument also reveal signs of partial coverage of clouds (Feinstein et al. 2023). Most of the previous studies have focused on interpreting spectral data with 1D models. To explore how the chemical species and cloud particles are altered by global circulation, we applied a 2D photochemical model and a 2D microphysical cloud model separately to post-process the thermal and dynamical structures simulated by a 3D general circulation model (GCM) of WASP-39b. We found that SO$_2$ produced by photochemistry on the dayside can be transported to the nightside owing to the efficient replenishment of horizontal transport. The morning-evening limb differences in methane (CH$_4$) abundances predicted by the 1D models disappeared after horizontal transport is included. Similarly, the inclusion of horizontal transport also reduced the limb differences in SO$_2$. Our modeling results suggest that the fast zonal wind results in minimal or negligible limb asymmetry in composition. Based on the synthetic spectra generated by our 2D atmosphere simulations, we propose that observing SO$_2$ absorption in the emission spectra of WASP-39b at different phases may offer opportunities to probe the horizontal quenching process of photochemical products. We will focus on the gas-phase chemistry in this paper and leave the results regarding clouds in the subsequent paper as part of the series.</description>

      <title>Survival of the long-lived inner disk of PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The K7 T Tauri star PDS 70 remains the best laboratory for investigating the influence of giant planet formation on the structure of the parental disk. One of the most intriguing discoveries is the detection of a resolved inner disk from ALMA observations that extends up to the orbit of PDS 70b. It is challenging to explain this inner disk because most of the dust particles are expected to be trapped at the outer edge of the gap opened by PDS 70b and PDS 70c. By performing dust evolution models in combination with radiative transfer simulations that match the gas disk masses obtained from recent thermo-chemical models of PDS 70, we find that when the minimum grain size in the models is larger than 0.1$\mu$m, there is an efficient filtration of dust particles, and the inner disk is depleted during the first million year of dust evolution. To maintain an inner disk, the minimum grain size in the models therefore needs to be smaller than 0.1$\mu$m. Only when grains are that small are they diffused and dragged along with the gas throughout the gap opened by the planets. The small grains transported in the inner disk grow and drift into it, but the constant reservoir of dust particles that are trapped at the outer edge of the gap and that continuously fragment allows the inner disk to refill on million-year timescales. Our flux predictions at millimeter wavelength of these models agree with ALMA observations. These models predict a spectral index of 3.2 in the outer and 3.6 in the inner disk. Our simple analytical calculations show that the water emission in the inner disk that was recently observed with the James Webb Space Telescope may originate from these ice-coated small grains that flow through the gap, grow, and drift toward the innermost disk regions to reach the water snowline.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI MRS Images Disk Winds, Water, and CO in an Edge-On Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST MIRI MRS observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around the young sub-solar mass star Tau 042021, acquired as part of the Cycle 1 GO program "Mapping Inclined Disk Astrochemical Signatures (MIDAS)." These data resolve the mid-IR spatial distributions of H$_2$, revealing X-shaped emission extending to ~200 au above the disk midplane with a semi-opening angle of $35 \pm 5$ degrees. We do not velocity-resolve the gas in the spectral images, but the measured semi-opening angle of the H$_2$ is consistent with an MHD wind origin. A collimated, bipolar jet is seen in forbidden emission lines from [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ni II], [Fe II], [Ar II], and [S III]. Extended H$_2$O and CO emission lines are also detected, reaching diameters between ~90 and 190 au, respectively. Hot molecular emission is not expected at such radii, and we interpret its extended spatial distribution as scattering of inner disk molecular emission by dust grains in the outer disk surface. H I recombination lines, characteristic of inner disk accretion shocks, are similarly extended, and are likely also scattered light from the innermost star-disk interface. Finally, we detect extended PAH emission at 11.3 microns co-spatial with the scattered light continuum, making this the first low-mass T Tauri star around which extended PAHs have been confirmed, to our knowledge. MIRI MRS line images of edge-on disks provide an unprecedented window into the outflow, accretion, and scattering processes within protoplanetary disks, allowing us to constrain the disk lifetimes and accretion and mass loss mechanisms.</description>
