      <title>Analysis of in-vivo skin anisotropy using elastic wave measurements and Bayesian modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vivo skin exhibits viscoelastic, hyper-elastic and non-linear characteristics. It is under a constant non-equibiaxial tension in its natural configuration and is reinforced with oriented collagen fibers, giving rise to anisotropic behaviour. Understanding the complex mechanical behaviour of skin has relevance across many sectors including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and surgery. However, there is a dearth of quality data characterizing human skin anisotropy in vivo. The available data is usually confined to limited population groups and/or limited angular resolution. Here, we use elastic waves travelling through the skin to obtain measurements from 78 volunteers from 3 to 93 years old. Using a Bayesian framework, we analyse the effect that age, gender and level of skin tension have on the skin anisotropy and stiffness. First, we propose a new measurement of anisotropy based on the eccentricity of angular data and conclude that it is a more robust measurement compared to the classic ``anisotropic ratio". We then find that in vivo skin anisotropy increases logarithmically with age, while the skin stiffness increases linearly along the direction of Langer Lines. We also conclude that gender does not significantly affect the skin anisotropy level, but does affect the overall stiffness, with males having stiffer skin on average. Finally, we find that skin tension significantly affects both the anisotropy and stiffness measurements, indicating that elastic wave measurements have promising applications in determining in vivo skin tension. In contrast to earlier studies, these results represent a comprehensive assessment of the variation of skin anisotropy with age and gender using a sizeable dataset and robust modern statistical analysis. This data has implications for the planning of surgical procedures and the adoption of universal cosmetic surgery practices for young or elderly patients.</description>

      <title>Learning to crawl: benefits and limits of centralized vs distributed control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of a crawler consisting of several suckers distributed along a straight line and connected by springs. Both proprioception and control are binary: the system responds to the elongation vs compression of its springs and the suckers can either adhere or remain idle. A central pattern generator delivers a traveling wave of compression, and the crawler is tasked to learn how to control adhesion to effectively ride the wave in order to crawl. We ask what are the benefits and limitations of distributed vs centralized learning architectures. Using tabular Q-learning we demonstrate that crawling can be learned by trial and error in a purely distributed setting where each sucker learns independently how to control adhesion, with no exchange of information among them. We find that centralizing control of all suckers enhances speed and robustness to failure by orchestrating smoother collective dynamics and partly overcoming the limitations of rudimentary proprioception and control. However, since the computational cost scales exponentially with the number of suckers, centralized control quickly becomes untreatable with the size of the crawler. We then show that intermediate levels of centralization, where multiple control centers coordinate subsets of suckers, can negotiate fast and robust crawling while avoiding excessive computational burden. Our model can be further generalized to explore the trade-offs between crawling speed, robustness to failure, computational cost and information exchange that shape the emergence of biological solutions for crawling and could inspire the design of robotic crawlers.</description>

      <title>Static vs dynamic rough energy landscapes: Where is diffusion faster?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules in dense environments, such as biological cells, are subjected to forces that fluctuate both in time and in space. While spatial fluctuations are captured by Lifson-Jackson-Zwanzig's model of "diffusion in a rough potential", and temporal fluctuations are often viewed as leading to additional friction effects, a unified view where the environment fluctuates both in time and in space is currently lacking. Here we introduce a discrete-state model of a landscape fluctuating both in time and in space. Importantly, the model accounts for the back-reaction of the diffusing particle on the landscape. As a result we find, surprisingly, that many features of the observable dynamics do not depend on the temporal fluctuation timescales and are already captured by the model of diffusion in a rough potential, even though this assumes a static energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Cell-Scale Dynamic Modeling of Membrane Interactions with Arbitrarily Shaped Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling membrane interactions with arbitrarily shaped colloidal particles, such as environmental micro- and nanoplastics, at the cell scale remains particularly challenging, owing to the complexity of particle geometries and the need to resolve fully coupled translational and rotational dynamics. Here, we present a force-based computational framework capable of capturing dynamic interactions between deformable lipid vesicles and rigid particles of irregular shapes. Both vesicle and particle surfaces are represented using triangulated meshes, and Langevin dynamics resolves membrane deformation alongside rigid-body particle motion. Adhesive interactions between the particle and membrane surfaces are modeled using two numerical schemes: a vertex-to-vertex mapping and a vertex-to-surface projection. The latter yields more accurate wrapping energetics, as demonstrated by benchmark comparisons against ideal spheres. The dynamic simulations reveal that lower particle-to-vesicle mass ratios facilitate frequent particle reorientation and complete membrane wrapping, while higher mass ratios limit orientation changes and stabilize partial wrapping. To illustrate the framework's versatility, we simulate interactions involving cubical, rod-like, bowl-shaped, and tetrahedral particles with spherical, cigar-shaped, or biconcave vesicles. This generalizable modeling approach enables predictive, cell-scale studies of membrane-particle interactions across a wide range of geometries, with applications in environmental biophysics and nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Sequential binding-unbinding based specific interactions highlight exchange dynamics and size distribution of condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of formation of organelles and biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation is a topic of great interest. It is reasonable to assume that the formation of protein-specific condensates inside a crowded, multicomponent cellular environment requires specific protein-protein interactions with lifetimes longer than non-specific protein-protein interactions. These longer-lived, specific interactions can arise through complex protein binding and unbinding pathways. In this work, we investigate single-step and sequential multi-step mechanisms for protein binding-unbinding interactions and model the lifetimes of such interactions in a heuristic manner. We show that while similar average interaction lifetimes can be achieved when binding-unbinding follows a single-step or a sequential multi-step process, the two processes result in two distinct lifetime distributions: exponential and truncated power-law, respectively. We then combine this model with Brownian dynamics simulations to elucidate the impact of these distinct lifetime distributions on condensate dynamics. Our model qualitatively captures important features of condensates, such as their fluidic nature, aging in protein interactions and its impact on the exchange dynamics, and the size distribution of condensates. In a nutshell, our model unravels how specificity in protein binding-unbinding interaction pathways, resulting in unique interaction lifetime distributions, is a key factor shaping the physical properties of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusion from competition between multi-exponential friction memory and energy barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subdiffusion is a hallmark of complex systems, ranging from protein folding to transport in viscoelastic media. However, despite its pervasiveness, the mechanistic origins of subdiffusion remain contested. Here, we analyze both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, in the presence and absence of energy barriers, in order to disentangle the distinct contributions of memory-dependent friction and energy barriers to the emergence of subdiffusive behavior. Focusing on the mean squared displacement (MSD), we develop an analytical framework that connects subdiffusion to multiscale memory effects in the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), and derive the subdiffusive scaling behavior of the MSD for systems governed by multi-exponential memory kernels. We identify persistence and relaxation timescales that delineate dynamical regimes in which subdiffusion arises from either memory or energy barrier effects. By comparing analytical predictions with simulations, we confirm that memory dominates the overdamped dynamics for barrier heights up to approximately $2\,k_BT$, a regime recently shown to be relevant for protein folding. Overall, our results advance the theoretical understanding of anomalous diffusion and provide practical tools that are broadly applicable to fields as diverse as molecular biophysics, polymer physics, and active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Insights into new mechanosensitive behaviors of G protein-coupled receptors</title>

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a diverse and vital family of membrane proteins that mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli, playing critical roles in physiology and disease. Traditionally recognized as chemical signal transducers, GPCRs have recently been implicated in mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. This review explores the emerging role of GPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced by mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which are central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. GPCRs, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the \b{eta}2-adrenergic receptor (\b{eta}2-AR), have demonstrated the ability to integrate mechanical and chemical signals, potentially through conformational changes and/or modulation of lipid interactions, leading to biased signaling. Recent studies highlight the dual activation mechanisms of GPCRs, with \b{eta}2-AR now serving as a key example of how mechanical and ligand-dependent pathways contribute to cardiovascular regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge of GPCR mechanosensitivity, emphasizing its implications for cardiovascular health and disease, and explores advancements in methodologies poised to further unravel the mechanistic intricacies of these receptors.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Epithelial Tissues as a Double Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11683v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way for a tissue described by a vertex model to tune its rigidity, by using ``tunable degrees of freedom." We use the vertex model elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as different sets of degrees of freedom describing cell-cell interactions that can be tuned to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as tunable degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as tunable degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can coordinate changes in cell-scale properties, treated here as tunable degrees of freedom, to achieve desired tissue-scale behaviors.</description>
