      <title>UNGT: Ultrasound Nasogastric Tube Dataset for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel ultrasound nasogastric tube (UNGT) dataset to address the lack of public nasogastric tube datasets. The UNGT dataset includes 493 images gathered from 110 patients with an average image resolution of approximately 879 $\times$ 583. Four structures, encompassing the liver, stomach, tube, and pancreas are precisely annotated. Besides, we propose a semi-supervised adaptive-weighting aggregation medical segmenter to address data limitation and imbalance concurrently. The introduced adaptive weighting approach tackles the severe unbalanced challenge by regulating the loss across varying categories as training proceeds. The presented multiscale attention aggregation block bolsters the feature representation by integrating local and global contextual information. With these, the proposed AAMS can emphasize sparse or small structures and feature enhanced representation ability. We perform extensive segmentation experiments on our UNGT dataset, and the results show that AAMS outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches to varying extents. In addition, we conduct comprehensive classification experiments across varying state-of-the-art methods and compare their performance. The dataset and code will be available upon publication at https://github.com/NUS-Tim/UNGT.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Gene-Based Testing for Antibiotic Resistance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibiotic Resistance (AR) is a critical global health challenge that necessitates the development of cost-effective, efficient, and accurate diagnostic tools. Given the genetic basis of AR, techniques such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that target specific resistance genes offer a promising approach for predictive diagnostics using a limited set of key genes. This study introduces GenoARM, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with transformer-based models to optimize the selection of PCR gene tests and improve AR predictions, leveraging observed metadata for improved accuracy. In our evaluation, we developed several high-performing baselines and compared them using publicly available datasets derived from real-world bacterial samples representing multiple clinically relevant pathogens. The results show that all evaluated methods achieve strong and reliable performance when metadata is not utilized. When metadata is introduced and the number of selected genes increases, GenoARM demonstrates superior performance due to its capacity to approximate rewards for unseen and sparse combinations. Overall, our framework represents a major advancement in optimizing diagnostic tools for AR in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Blind Flexible Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking that predicts the bound structures of small molecules (ligands) to their protein targets, plays a vital role in drug discovery. However, existing docking methods often face limitations: they either overlook crucial structural changes by assuming protein rigidity or suffer from low computational efficiency due to their reliance on generative models for structure sampling. To address these challenges, we propose FABFlex, a fast and accurate regression-based multi-task learning model designed for realistic blind flexible docking scenarios, where proteins exhibit flexibility and binding pocket sites are unknown (blind). Specifically, FABFlex's architecture comprises three specialized modules working in concert: (1) A pocket prediction module that identifies potential binding sites, addressing the challenges inherent in blind docking scenarios. (2) A ligand docking module that predicts the bound (holo) structures of ligands from their unbound (apo) states. (3) A pocket docking module that forecasts the holo structures of protein pockets from their apo conformations. Notably, FABFlex incorporates an iterative update mechanism that serves as a conduit between the ligand and pocket docking modules, enabling continuous structural refinements. This approach effectively integrates the three subtasks of blind flexible docking-pocket identification, ligand conformation prediction, and protein flexibility modeling-into a unified, coherent framework. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that FABFlex not only achieves superior effectiveness in predicting accurate binding modes but also exhibits a significant speed advantage (208 $\times$) compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/tmlr-group/FABFlex.</description>

      <title>Reward-Guided Iterative Refinement in Diffusion Models at Test-Time with Applications to Protein and DNA Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully leverage the capabilities of diffusion models, we are often interested in optimizing downstream reward functions during inference. While numerous algorithms for reward-guided generation have been recently proposed due to their significance, current approaches predominantly focus on single-shot generation, transitioning from fully noised to denoised states. We propose a novel framework for inference-time reward optimization with diffusion models inspired by evolutionary algorithms. Our approach employs an iterative refinement process consisting of two steps in each iteration: noising and reward-guided denoising. This sequential refinement allows for the gradual correction of errors introduced during reward optimization. Besides, we provide a theoretical guarantee for our framework. Finally, we demonstrate its superior empirical performance in protein and cell-type-specific regulatory DNA design.

      <title>Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of hair growth duration in human scalp follicles under normal and alopecic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hair follicles constantly cycle through phases of growth, regression and rest, as matrix keratinocytes (MKs), the cells producing hair fibers, proliferate, and then undergo spontaneous apoptosis. Damage to MKs and perturbations in their normal dynamics result in a shortened growth phase, leading to hair loss. Two common factors causing such disruption are hormonal imbalance and attacks by the immune system. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is hair loss caused by high sensitivity to androgens, and alopecia areata (AA) is hair loss caused by an autoimmune reaction against MKs. In this study, we inform a mathematical model for the human hair cycle with experimental data for the lengths of hair cycle phases available from male control subjects and subjects with AGA. We also, connect a mathematical model for AA with estimates for the duration of hair cycle phases obtained from the literature. Subsequently, with each model we perform parameter screening, uncertainty quantification and global sensitivity analysis and compare the results within and between the control and AGA subject groups as well as among AA, control and AGA conditions. The findings reveal that in AGA subjects there is greater uncertainty associated with the duration of hair growth than in control subjects and that, compared to control and AGA conditions, in AA it is more certain that longer hair growth phase could not be expected. The comparison of results also indicates that in AA lower proliferation of MKs and weaker communication of the dermal papilla with MKs via signaling molecules could be expected than in normal and AGA conditions, and in AA stronger inhibition of MK proliferation by regulatory molecules could be expected than in AGA. Finally, the global sensitivity analysis highlights the process of MK apoptosis as highly impactful for the length of hair growth only in the AA case, but not for control and AGA conditions.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Sequential Information of General Lab-test Results and Diagnoses History for Differential Diagnosis of Dementia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) faces multiple data-related challenges, including high variability in patient data, limited access to specialized diagnostic tests, and overreliance on single-type indicators. These challenges are exacerbated by the progressive nature of AD, where subtle pathophysiological changes often precede clinical symptoms by decades. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that takes advantage of routinely collected general laboratory test histories for the early detection and differential diagnosis of AD. By modeling lab test sequences as "sentences", we apply word embedding techniques to capture latent relationships between tests and employ deep time series models, including long-short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to model temporal patterns in patient records. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves diagnostic accuracy and enables scalable and costeffective AD screening in diverse clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Drug-Target Interaction/Affinity Prediction: Deep Learning Models and Advances Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery remains a slow and expensive process that involves many steps, from detecting the target structure to obtaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is often riddled with safety concerns. Accurate prediction of how drugs interact with their targets and the development of new drugs by using better methods and technologies have immense potential to speed up this process, ultimately leading to faster delivery of life-saving medications. Traditional methods used for drug-target interaction prediction show limitations, particularly in capturing complex relationships between drugs and their targets. As an outcome, deep learning models have been presented to overcome the challenges of interaction prediction through their precise and efficient end results. By outlining promising research avenues and models, each with a different solution but similar to the problem, this paper aims to give researchers a better idea of methods for even more accurate and efficient prediction of drug-target interaction, ultimately accelerating the development of more effective drugs. A total of 180 prediction methods for drug-target interactions were analyzed throughout the period spanning 2016 to 2025 using different frameworks based on machine learning, mainly deep learning and graph neural networks. Additionally, this paper discusses the novelty, architecture, and input representation of these models.</description>

      <title>A graph neural network-based model with Out-of-Distribution Robustness for enhancing Antiretroviral Therapy Outcome Prediction for HIV-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the outcome of antiretroviral therapies (ART) for HIV-1 is a pressing clinical challenge, especially when the ART includes drugs with limited effectiveness data. This scarcity of data can arise either due to the introduction of a new drug to the market or due to limited use in clinical settings, resulting in clinical dataset with highly unbalanced therapy representation. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel joint fusion model, which combines features from a Fully Connected (FC) Neural Network and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) in a multi-modality fashion. Our model uses both tabular data about genetic sequences and a knowledge base derived from Stanford drug-resistance mutation tables, which serve as benchmark references for deducing in-vivo treatment efficacy based on the viral genetic sequence. By leveraging this knowledge base structured as a graph, the GNN component enables our model to adapt to imbalanced data distributions and account for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) drugs. We evaluated these models' robustness against OoD drugs in the test set. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the proposed model consistently outperforms the FC model. These results underscore the advantage of integrating Stanford scores in the model, thereby enhancing its generalizability and robustness, but also extending its utility in contributing in more informed clinical decisions with limited data availability.
