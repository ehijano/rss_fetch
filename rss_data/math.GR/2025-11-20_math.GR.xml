      <title>Finite solvable groups of square-free Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characterization is completed for finite groups which act regularly on maps with square-free Euler characteristic, associated with infinite families of square-free Euler characteristic regular maps presented. This is based on a classification of finite groups of which each Sylow subgroup has a cyclic or dihedral subgroup of prime index.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Dehn Twists in the Outer Automorphism Group of a Free Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Dehn twists in the outer automorphism group of a finitely generated non-abelian free group. Our main result states that, under certain compatibility conditions, sufficiently large powers of finitely many Dehn twists generate a right-angled Artin group. The proof proceeds by analyzing the geometry of spheres, tori, and simple closed curves in a doubled handlebody. Along the way, we establish the bigon--bihedron criterion and an equivalent condition for commuting Dehn twists. Furthermore, we construct a compact topological space on which every Dehn twist acts parabolically.</description>

      <title>Non-closed subgroups of weakly branch groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a weakly branch group $G$ acting on a regular enough rooted tree, we provide two constructions of continuous families of distinct subgroups that are not closed in the profinite topology on $G$. On the one hand, we construct a continuous family of distinct non-closed subgroups such that each $H$ in the family is not ERF, that is, contains subgroups not closed in the profinite topology on $H$. On the other hand, under an additional assumption on $G$, we construct a continuous family of ERF subgroups which are not closed in the congruence (and in the profinite) topology on $G$.</description>

      <title>Subracks and second homology of the conjugacy classes of finite projective special linear groups of degree two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the subracks of the conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,q)$ based on Dickson's theorem on subgroups of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,q)$. All minimal non-abelian subracks of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,q)$ are determined. Further, we provide a general result on the relationship of associated groups of conjugacy classes in perfect groups to the Schur multiplier of the group. This allows us to conclude explicit descriptions of the associated groups and the second homology of the conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,q)$ for $q&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Endomorphism and automorphism graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The directed endomorphism graph, $\dend(G)$ of $G$ is a directed graph with vertex set $G$ and there is a directed edge from the vertex $a$ to the vertex $b$ if $a \neq b$ and there exists an endomorphism on $G$ mapping $a$ to $b$. The endomorphism graph, $\uend(G)$ is the corresponding undirected simple graph. The automorphism graph of $G$ is similarly defined for automorphisms: it is a disjoint union of complete graphs on the orbits of $\Aut(G)$. The endomorphism digraph is a special case of a digraph associated with a transformation monoid, and we begin by introducing this. We have explored graph theoretic properties like size, planarity, girth etc. and tried finding out for which types of groups these graphs are complete, diconnected, trees, bipartite and so on, as well as computing these graphs for some special groups. We conclude with examples showing that things are not always simple.</description>

      <title>Local indicability in the presence of diagrammatic reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a complex $X$ is a subcomplex of a diagrammatically reducible 2-complex $Y$ that has locally indicable fundamental group, then $X$ has locally indicable fundamental group. This is a consequence of the Corson-Trace characterization of diagrammatic reducibility. In this paper we use a Corson-Trace like characterization of diagrammatic reducibility away from a subcomplex to obtain a considerable stronger result. We apply this to the question of local indicability in the context of Whitehead's asphericity conjecture. We show that an injective labeled oriented tree (LOT) that is diagrammatically reducible of degree 2, and all its quotients are as well, is locally indicable.</description>

      <title>Graphically discrete groups and rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of graphical discreteness to group theory. A finitely generated group is graphically discrete if whenever it acts geometrically on a locally finite graph, the automorphism group of the graph is compact-by-discrete. Notable examples include finitely generated nilpotent groups, most lattices in semisimple Lie groups, and irreducible non-geometric 3-manifold groups. We show graphs of groups with graphically discrete vertex groups frequently have strong rigidity properties. We prove free products of one-ended virtually torsion-free graphically discrete groups are action rigid within the class of virtually torsion-free groups. We also prove quasi-isometric rigidity for many hyperbolic graphs of groups whose vertex groups are closed hyperbolic manifold groups and whose edge groups are non-elementary quasi-convex subgroups. This includes the case of two hyperbolic 3-manifold groups amalgamated along a quasi-convex malnormal non-abelian free subgroup. We provide several additional examples of graphically discrete groups and illustrate this property is not a commensurability invariant.</description>

      <title>Long relators in groups generated by two parabolic elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a family of groups generated by a pair of parabolic elements in which every relator must admit a long subword of a specific form. In particular, this collection contains groups in which the number of syllables of any relator is arbitrarily large. This suggests that the existing methods for finding non-free groups with rational parabolic generators may be inadequate in this case, as they depend on the presence of relators with few syllables. Our results rely on two variants of the ping-pong lemma that we develop, applicable to groups that are possibly non-free. These variants aim to isolate the group elements responsible for the failure of the classical ping-pong lemma.</description>

      <title>Categorification of characteristic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a representation theory of categories as a means to explore characteristic structures in algebra. Characteristic structures play a critical role in isomorphism testing of groups and algebras, and their construction and description often rely on specific knowledge of the parent object and its automorphisms. In many cases, questions of reproducibility and comparison arise. Here we present a categorical framework that addresses these questions. We prove that every characteristic structure is the image of a functor equipped with a natural transformation. This shifts the local description in the parent object to a global one in the ambient category. Through constructions in representation theory, such as tensor products, we can combine characteristic structure across multiple categories. Our results are constructive, stated in the language of a constructive type theory, which facilitates implementations in theorem checkers.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology, quotient extensions, and hierarchical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a central extension bounded if its Euler class is represented by a bounded cocycle. We prove that a bounded central extension of a hierarchically hyperbolic group (HHG) is still a HHG; conversely if a central extension is a HHG, then the extension is bounded, and under a further mild assumption the quotient is commensurable to a HHG. Motivated by questions on hierarchical hyperbolicity of quotients of mapping class groups, we therefore consider the general problem of determining when a quotient of a bounded central extension is still bounded, which we prove to be equivalent to an extendability problem for quasihomomorphisms. Finally, we show that quotients of the 4-strands braid group by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov are HHG, and in fact bounded central extensions of some HHG. We also speculate on how to extend the previous result to all mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Frame Vector Group Representations and Amenability Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new characterization of amenability for countable groups, based on frame representations admitting almost invariant vectors. By relaxing the frame inequalities, thereby weakening amenability, we obtain a large class of countable groups which we call {\it framenable}. We show that this class has some permanence properties, stands in contrast with property (T), and contains, for example, all free groups $\mathbb{F}_n$, $\textup{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $\textup{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_3)$, all (countable) lattices of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, the Baumslag-Solitar groups $BS_{p,q}$, the braid groups $B_n$, and Thompson's group $F$.</description>
