      <title>Comprehensive Review of 2$\beta$ Decay Half-Lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double-beta (2$\beta$)-decay is the rarest nuclear physics process, and its experimental half-lives (T$_{1/2}$) exceed the age of the Universe from nine to fourteen orders of magnitude. Double-beta decay was observed, and its half-life was measured in 14 parent nuclei using direct, radiochemical, and geochemical methods. The decay observables are analyzed using the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) procedures, and the recommended T$_{1/2}$ were deduced. Using the calculated values of phase factors, the effective nuclear matrix elements were extracted and compared with available data. Thousands of theoretical and experimental works have been dedicated to these topics in the last 85 years, and we present two data sets of recommended values to encapsulate the results.</description>

      <title>Seven-dimensional Trajectory Reconstruction for VAMOS++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is characterized by a large angular and momentum acceptance and highly non-linear ion optics properties requiring the use of software ion trajectory reconstruction methods to measure the ion magnetic rigidity and the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer. Standard measurements, involving the use of a thin target and a narrow beam spot, allow the assumption of a point-like beam interaction volume for ion trajectory reconstruction. However, this represents a limitation for the case of large beam spot size or extended gaseous target volume. To overcome this restriction, a seven-dimensional reconstruction method incorporating the reaction position coordinates was developed, making use of artificial deep neural networks. The neural networks were trained on a theoretical dataset generated by standard magnetic ray-tracing code. Future application to a voluminous gas target, necessitating the explicit inclusion of the three-dimensional position of the beam interaction point within the target in the trajectory reconstruction method, is discussed. The performances of the new method are presented along with a comparison of mass resolution obtained with previously reported model for the case of thin-target experimental data.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $^{40}$Ar(e,e$^{\prime}$) elastic scattering cross section with a novel gas-jet target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a measurement of elastic electron scattering on argon performed with a novel cryogenic gas-jet target at the Mainz Microtron accelerator MAMI. The luminosity is estimated with the thermodynamical parameters of the target and by comparison to a calculation in distorted-wave Born approximation. The cross section, measured at new momentum transfers of 1.24 fm$^{-1}$ and 1.55 fm$^{-1}$ is in agreement with previous experiments performed with a traditional high-pressure gas target, as well as with modern ab-initio calculations employing state-of-the-art nuclear forces from chiral effective field theory. The nearly background-free measurement highlights the optimal properties of the gas-jet target for elements heavier than hydrogen, enabling new applications in hadron and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of cosmic muon-induced neutron background with ISMRAN detector in a non-reactor environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN) is an above-ground, very short baseline reactor anti-neutrino (${\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{e}$) experiment, located inside the Dhruva research reactor facility, Mumbai, India. The primary goal of the ISMRAN experiment is the indirect detection of reactor ${\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{e}$ through an inverse beta decay (IBD) process, using a cluster of 90 optically segmented plastic scintillator detectors, weighing $\sim$1 ton. In this work, we present the neutron capture time response and energy deposition of neutron capture signals generated by cosmic muons in the ISMRAN geometry, and we compare these experimental results with Geant4-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The obtained mean capture time of fast neutrons is 74.46 $\pm$ 5.98 $\mathrm{\mu}$s and is comparable with the MC simulation results. The efficiency-corrected rate of muon-induced neutron background inside the ISMRAN geometry, due to the presence of a passive shielding structure of 10 cm lead followed by 10 cm borated polyethylene with a surface area of 600 $\mathrm{cm^{2}}$, deployed on top of the ISMRAN setup, is reported to be 1334 $\pm$ 64 (stat.) $\pm$ 70 (sys.) per day. This result shows good agreement with the expected background rate from MC simulations using Geant4. We also estimate the muon-induced fast-neutron rate in the ISMRAN geometry for the actual shielding configuration of 9000 $\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ surface area to be 3335 $\pm$ 160 (stat.) $\pm$ 175 (sys.) neutrons $\mathrm{day^{-1}}$ through an extrapolation, after incorporating the model dependent acceptance correction factor from the Geant4 MC simulation. Finally, using these results, we evaluate the neutron production yield due to the composite shielding in the ISMRAN geometry, which is 2.81$\times$$\mathrm{10^{-5}}$ neutrons per $\mu$ per (g/$\mathrm{cm^{2}}$) at sea level.</description>

      <title>Atomic determination of the nuclear quadrupole moment $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}{\rm Bi})$ using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method implemented in the Grasp2018 package was employed to calculate the magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction constants and electric field gradients of levels in the ground configuration of the neutral bismuth atom. Combining the calculated electric field gradient of the ground state with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine interaction constant, we extracted the nuclear quadrupole moment for the $^{209}$Bi isotope, $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}\textbf{Bi}) = -422(22)$~mb. This value, together with other results obtained from atomic- and molecular-structure calculations, created the ``world average" nuclear quadrupole moment of this isotope, $\mathrm{Q}(^{209}\textbf{Bi}) = -420(17)$~mb.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Athermal phonon collection efficiency in diamond crystals for low mass dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explored the efficacy of lab-grown diamonds as potential target materials for the direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter~(DM) using metallic magnetic calorimeters~(MMCs). Diamond, with its excellent phononic properties and the low atomic mass of the constituent carbon, can play a crucial role in detecting low-mass dark matter particles. The relatively long electron-hole pair lifetime inside the crystal may provide discrimination power between the DM-induced nuclear recoil events and the background-induced electron recoil events. Utilizing the the fast response times of the MMCs and their unique geometric versatility, we deployed a novel methodology for quantifying phonon dynamics inside diamond crystals. We demonstrated that lab-grown diamond crystals fabricated via the chemical vapor deposition~(CVD) technique can satisfy the stringent quality requirements for sub-GeV dark matter searches. The high-quality polycrystalline CVD diamond showed a superior athermal phonon collection efficiency compared to that of the reference sapphire crystal, and achieved energy resolution 62.7~eV at the 8.05~keV copper fluorescence line. With this energy resolution, we explored the low-energy range below 100~eV and confirmed the existence of so-called low-energy excess~(LEE) reported by multiple cryogenic experiments.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 contribution in the Drell-Yan process with tensor-polarized deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron can be probed through the proton-deuteron Drell-Yan process, where the proton is unpolarized and the deuteron is tensor polarized. This measurement will be conducted at Fermilab in the near future. In this reaction, the twist-3 contribution is not negligible compared to the twist-2 contribution due to the limited invariant mass of the dilepton pair. We calculate the twist-3 contribution for the Drell-Yan cross section with a tensor-polarized deuteron target, preserving the U(1)-gauge invariance of the hadronic tensor. The cross sections and weighted cross sections are expressed in terms of the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs), thus one can extract the PDFs $f_{1\scriptscriptstyle{LL}}$, $f_{\scriptscriptstyle{LT}}$, and $f^{(1)}_{\scriptscriptstyle{1LT}}$ from the experimental measurements of Drell-Yan process. Our study should be helpful to solve the puzzle in the tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron.</description>
