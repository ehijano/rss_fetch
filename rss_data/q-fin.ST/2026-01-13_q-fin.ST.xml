      <title>PriceSeer: Evaluating Large Language Models in Real-Time Stock Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock prediction, a subject closely related to people's investment activities in fully dynamic and live environments, has been widely studied. Current large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various domains, exhibiting expert-level performance through advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. In this paper, we introduce PriceSeer, a live, dynamic, and data-uncontaminated benchmark specifically designed for LLMs performing stock prediction tasks. Specifically, PriceSeer includes 110 U.S. stocks from 11 industrial sectors, with each containing 249 historical data points. Our benchmark implements both internal and external information expansion, where LLMs receive extra financial indicators, news, and fake news to perform stock price prediction. We evaluate six cutting-edge LLMs under different prediction horizons, demonstrating their potential in generating investment strategies after obtaining accurate price predictions for different sectors. Additionally, we provide analyses of LLMs' suboptimal performance in long-term predictions, including the vulnerability to fake news and specific industries. The code and evaluation data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/BobLiang2113/PriceSeer.</description>

      <title>Cross-Market Alpha: Testing Short-Term Trading Factors in the U.S. Market via Double-Selection LASSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current asset pricing research exhibits a significant gap: a lack of sufficient cross-market validation regarding short-term trading-based factors. Against this backdrop, the development of the Chinese A-share market which is characterized by its retail-investor dominance, policy sensitivity, and high-frequency active trading -- has given rise to specific short-term trading-based factors. This study systematically examines the universality of factors from the Alpha191 library in the U.S. market, addressing the challenge of high-dimensional factor screening through the double-selection LASSO algorithm an established method for cross-market, high-dimensional research. After controlling for 151 fundamental factors from the U.S. equity factor zoo, 17 Alpha191 factors selected by this procedure exhibit significant incremental explanatory power for the cross-section of U.S. stock returns at the 5% level. Together these findings demonstrate that short-term trading-based factors, originating from the unique structure of the Chinese A-share market, provide incremental information not captured by existing mainstream pricing models, thereby enhancing the explanation of cross-sectional return differences.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Singular-Value Learning for Cross-Covariances Forecasting in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new wave of work on covariance cleaning and nonlinear shrinkage has delivered asymptotically optimal analytical solutions for large covariance matrices. Building on this progress, these ideas have been generalized to empirical cross-covariance matrices, whose singular-value shrinkage characterizes comovements between one set of assets and another. Existing analytical cross-covariance cleaners are derived under strong stationarity and large-sample assumptions, and they typically rely on mesoscopic regularity conditions such as bounded spectra; macroscopic common modes (e.g., a global market factor) violate these conditions. When applied to real equity returns, where dependence structures drift over time and global modes are prominent, we find that these theoretically optimal formulas do not translate into robust out-of-sample performance. We address this gap by designing a random-matrix-inspired neural architecture that operates in the empirical singular-vector basis and learns a nonlinear mapping from empirical singular values to their corresponding cleaned values. By construction, the network can recover the analytical solution as a special case, yet it remains flexible enough to adapt to non-stationary dynamics and mode-driven distortions. Trained on a long history of equity returns, the proposed method achieves a more favorable bias-variance trade-off than purely analytical cleaners and delivers systematically lower out-of-sample cross-covariance prediction errors. Our results demonstrate that combining random-matrix theory with machine learning makes asymptotic theories practically effective in realistic time-varying markets.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Aligned Meta-Learning for Risk Management: A Stacking Approach for Multi-Source Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a meta-learning framework for credit risk assessment of Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that explicitly addresses the temporal misalignment of credit scoring models.
  The approach aligns financial statement reference dates with evaluation dates, mitigating bias arising from publication delays and asynchronous data sources. It is based on a two-step temporal decomposition that at first estimates annual probabilities of default (PDs) anchored to balance-sheet reference dates (December 31st) through a static model. Then it models the monthly evolution of PDs using higher-frequency behavioral data. Finally, we employ stacking-based architecture to aggregate multiple scoring systems, each capturing complementary aspects of default risk, into a unified predictive model. In this way, first level model outputs are treated as learned representations that encode non-linear relationships in financial and behavioral indicators, allowing integration of new expert-based features without retraining base models. This design provides a coherent and interpretable solution to challenges typical of low-default environments, including heterogeneous default definitions and reporting delays. Empirical validation shows that the framework effectively captures credit risk evolution over time, improving temporal consistency and predictive stability relative to standard ensemble methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data. Our code is available at https://github.com/xymmmm00/diffusion_factor_model.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Markets: Machine learning modeling and Prediction Using 2-Manifold Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Geometry Informed Model for financial forecasting by embedding high dimensional market data onto constant curvature 2manifolds. Guided by the uniformization theorem, we model market dynamics as Brownian motion on spherical S2, Euclidean R2, and hyperbolic H2 geometries. We further include the torus T, a compact, flat manifold admissible as a quotient space of the Euclidean plane anticipating its relevance for capturing cyclical dynamics. Manifold learning techniques infer the latent curvature from financial data, revealing the torus as the best performing geometry. We interpret this result through a macroeconomic lens, the torus circular dimensions align with endogenous cycles in output, interest rates, and inflation described by IS LM theory. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating differential geometry with data-driven inference for financial modeling.</description>
