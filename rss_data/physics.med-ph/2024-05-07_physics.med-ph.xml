      <title>Non-invasive magnetocardiography of living rat based on diamond quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetocardiography (MCG) has emerged as a sensitive and precise method to diagnose cardiovascular diseases, providing more diagnostic information than traditional technology. However, the sensor limitations of conventional MCG systems, such as large size and cryogenic requirement, have hindered the widespread application and in-depth understanding of this technology. In this study, we present a high-sensitivity, room-temperature MCG system based on the negatively charged Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The magnetic cardiac signal of a living rat, characterized by an approximately 20 pT amplitude in the R-wave, is successfully captured through non-invasive measurement using this innovative solid-state spin sensor. To detect these extremely weak biomagnetic signals, we utilize sensitivity-enhancing techniques such as magnetic flux concentration. These approaches have enabled us to simultaneously achieve a magnetometry sensitivity of 9 $\text{pT}\cdot \text{Hz}^{-1/2}$ and a sensor scale of 5 $\text{mm}$. By extending the sensing scale of the NV centers from cellular and molecular level to macroscopic level of living creatures, we have opened the future of solid-state quantum sensing technologies in clinical environments.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Monte Carlo and Deep Learning Approach for Fast and Generic Photon Beam Dose Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dosimetry is an essential tool to provide the best and safest radio-therapies to a patient. In this field, Monte-Carlo simulations are considered to be the golden standard for predicting accurately the deposited dose in the body. Such methods are very time-consuming and simpler dose calculation engines, like dose kernel approaches, were created for cases where a fast estimation is necessary. In those approaches, dose distribution maps (or dose kernel) are learned for simple beams geometry, then, a combination of numerous kernels is used to simulate more complex beams. However, those methods often lack personalization and oversimplify the human body, especially for the secondary interactions dose deposition. In this article, we explore the possibility of learning the dose kernel using convolutional neural networks to improve their accuracy towards each different human body. We also highlight the limits of such approaches.</description>

      <title>Data Format Standardization and DICOM Integration for Hyperpolarized 13C MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C MRI has shown promise as a valuable modality for in vivo measurements of metabolism and is currently in human trials at 15 research sites worldwide. With this growth it is important to adopt standardized data storage practices as it will allow sites to meaningfully compare data.
  In this paper we (1) describe data that we believe should be stored and (2) demonstrate pipelines and methods that utilize the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard. This includes proposing a set of minimum set of information that is specific to HP 13C MRI studies. We then show where the majority of these can be fit into existing DICOM Attributes, primarily via the "Contrast/Bolus" module.
  We also demonstrate pipelines for utilizing DICOM for HP 13C MRI. DICOM is the most common standard for clinical medical image storage and provides the flexibility to accommodate the unique aspects of HP 13C MRI, including the HP agent information but also spectroscopic and metabolite dimensions. The pipelines shown include creating DICOM objects for studies on human and animal imaging systems with various pulse sequences. We also show a python-based method to efficiently modify DICOM objects to incorporate the unique HP 13C MRI information that is not captured by existing pipelines. Moreover, we propose best practices for HP 13C MRI data storage that will support future multi-site trials, research studies and technical developments of this imaging technique.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphic Transformer-based Abdomen MRI-CT Deformable Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to create a deep learning framework that can estimate the deformation vector field (DVF) for directly registering abdominal MRI-CT images. The proposed method assumed a diffeomorphic deformation. By using topology-preserved deformation features extracted from the probabilistic diffeomorphic registration model, abdominal motion can be accurately obtained and utilized for DVF estimation. The model integrated Swin transformers, which have demonstrated superior performance in motion tracking, into the convolutional neural network (CNN) for deformation feature extraction. The model was optimized using a cross-modality image similarity loss and a surface matching loss. To compute the image loss, a modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND) was used between the deformed MRI and CT images. The surface matching loss was determined by measuring the distance between the warped coordinates of the surfaces of contoured structures on the MRI and CT images. The deformed MRI image was assessed against the CT image using the target registration error (TRE), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and mean surface distance (MSD) between the deformed contours of the MRI image and manual contours of the CT image. When compared to only rigid registration, DIR with the proposed method resulted in an increase of the mean DSC values of the liver and portal vein from 0.850 and 0.628 to 0.903 and 0.763, a decrease of the mean MSD of the liver from 7.216 mm to 3.232 mm, and a decrease of the TRE from 26.238 mm to 8.492 mm. The proposed deformable image registration method based on a diffeomorphic transformer provides an effective and efficient way to generate an accurate DVF from an MRI-CT image pair of the abdomen. It could be utilized in the current treatment planning workflow for liver radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Virtual Extended-Range Tomography (VERT): Contact-free realistic ultrasonic bone imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound tomography generally struggles to reconstruct high-contrast and/or extended-range problems. A prime example is site-specific in-vivo bone imaging, crucial for accurately assessing the risk of life-threatening fractures, which are preventable given accurate diagnosis and treatment. In this type of problem, two main obstacles arise: (a) an external region prohibits access to the region of interest (ROI), and (b) high contrast exists between the two regions. These challenges impede existing algorithms -- including bent-ray tomography (BRT), known for its robustness, speed, and reasonable short-range resolution. We propose Virtual Extended-Range Tomography (VERT), which tackles these challenges through (a) placement of virtual transducers directly on the ROI, facilitating (b) rapid initialisation before BRT inversion. In-silico validation against BRT with and without a-priori information shows superior resolution and robustness -- while maintaining or even improving speed. These improvements are drastic where the external region is much larger than the ROI. Additional validation against the practically impossible -- BRT directly on the ROI -- demonstrates that VERT is approaching the resolution limit. The capability to solve high-contrast extended-range tomography problems without prior knowledge about the ROI's interior has many implications. VERT has the potential to unlock site-specific in-vivo bone imaging for assessing fracture risk, potentially saving millions of lives globally. In other applications, VERT may replace classical BRT to yield improvements in resolution, robustness and speed -- especially where the ROI does not cover the entire imaging array. For even higher resolution, VERT offers a reliable starting background to complement algorithms with less robustness and high computational costs.</description>

      <title>Automatic Ultrasound Curve Angle Measurement via Affinity Clustering for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current clinical gold standard for evaluating adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is X-ray radiography, using Cobb angle measurement. However, the frequent monitoring of the AIS progression using X-rays poses a challenge due to the cumulative radiation exposure. Although 3D ultrasound has been validated as a reliable and radiation-free alternative for scoliosis assessment, the process of measuring spinal curvature is still carried out manually. Consequently, there is a considerable demand for a fully automatic system that can locate bony landmarks and perform angle measurements. To this end, we introduce an estimation model for automatic ultrasound curve angle (UCA) measurement. The model employs a dual-branch network to detect candidate landmarks and perform vertebra segmentation on ultrasound coronal images. An affinity clustering strategy is utilized within the vertebral segmentation area to illustrate the affinity relationship between candidate landmarks. Subsequently, we can efficiently perform line delineation from a clustered affinity map for UCA measurement. As our method is specifically designed for UCA calculation, this method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for landmark and line detection tasks. The high correlation between the automatic UCA and Cobb angle (R$^2$=0.858) suggests that our proposed method can potentially replace manual UCA measurement in ultrasound scoliosis assessment.</description>

      <title>Correcting directional dark-field x-ray imaging artefacts using position-dependent image deblurring and attenuation removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, a novel x-ray imaging modality has emerged that reveals unresolved sample microstructure via a "dark-field image", which provides complementary information to conventional "bright-field" images, such as attenuation and phase-contrast modalities. This x-ray dark-field signal is produced by unresolved microstructures scattering the x-ray beam resulting in localised image blur. Dark-field retrieval techniques extract this blur to reconstruct a dark-field image. Unfortunately, the presence of non-dark-field blur such as source-size blur or the detector point-spread-function can affect the dark-field retrieval as they also blur the experimental image. In addition, dark-field images can be degraded by the artefacts induced by large intensity gradients from attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, particularly around sample edges. By measuring any non-dark-field blurring across the image plane and removing it from experimental images, as well as removing attenuation and propagation-based phase contrast, we show that a directional dark-field image can be retrieved with fewer artefacts and more consistent quantitative measures. We present the details of these corrections and provide "before and after" directional dark-field images of samples imaged at a synchrotron source. This paper utilises single-grid directional dark-field imaging, but these corrections have the potential to be broadly applied to other x-ray imaging techniques.</description>
