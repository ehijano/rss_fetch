      <title>Barr-coexactness for metric compact Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact metric spaces form an important class of metric spaces, but the category that they define lacks many important properties such as completeness and cocompleteness. In recent studies of "metric domain theory" and Stone-type dualities, the more general notion of a (separated) metric compact Hausdorff space emerged as a metric counterpart of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces. Roughly speaking, a metric compact Hausdorff space is a metric space equipped with a \emph{compatible} compact Hausdorff topology (which does not need to be the induced topology). These spaces maintain many important features of compact metric spaces, and, notably, the resulting category is much better behaved. Moreover, one can use inspiration from the theory of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces to solve problems for metric structures.
  In this paper we continue this line of research: in the category of separated metric compact Hausdorff spaces we characterise the regular monomorphisms as the embeddings and the epimorphisms as the surjective morphisms. Moreover, we show that epimorphisms out of an object $X$ can be encoded internally on $X$ by their kernel metrics, which are characterised as the continuous metrics below the metric on $X$; this gives a convenient way to represent quotient objects. Finally, as the main result, we prove that its dual category has an algebraic flavour: it is Barr-exact. While we show that it cannot be a variety of finitary algebras, it remains open whether it is an infinitary variety.</description>

      <title>Categorical Framework for Typed Extensional and Intensional Models in Formal Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensional computation derives concrete outputs from abstract function definitions; extensional computation defines functions through explicit input-output pairs. In formal semantics: intensional computation interprets expressions as context-dependent functions; extensional computation evaluates expressions based on their denotations in an otherwise fixed context. This paper reformulates typed extensional and intensional models of formal semantics within a category-theoretic framework and demonstrates their natural representation therein. We construct $\textbf{ModInt}$, the category of intensional models, building on the categories $\textbf{Set}$ of sets, $\textbf{Rel}$ of relations, and $\textbf{Kr}$ and $\textbf{Kr}_\textbf{b}$ of Kripke frames with monotone maps and bounded morphisms, respectively. We prove that trivial intensional models are equivalent to extensional models, providing a unified categorical representation of intensionality and extensionality in formal semantics. This approach reinterprets the relationship between intensions and extensions in a categorical framework and offers a modular, order-independent method for processing intensions and recovering extensions; contextualizing the relationship between content and reference in category-theoretic terms. We discuss implications for natural language semantics and propose future directions for contextual integration and exploring $\textbf{ModInt}$'s algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>The Wehrheim-Woodward category of linear canonical relations between G-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the work in a previous paper with David Li-Bland to construct the Wehrheim-Woodward category WW(GSLREL) of equivariant linear canonical relations between linear symplectic G-spaces for a compact group G. When G is the trivial group, this reduces to the previous result that the morphisms in WW(SLREL) may be identified with pairs (L,k) consisting of a linear canonical relation and a nonnegative integer.</description>

      <title>Classification and nonexistence results for tensor $t$-structures on derived categories of schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work examines $t$-structures in derived categories related to Noetherian schemes, establishing both classification and nonexistence results for compactly generated $t$-structures that satisfy a tensor compatibility condition. First, we classify which $t$-structures on the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves can be restricted to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves. This significantly generalizes Takahashi's results for CM-excellent rings of finite Krull dimension, and its sharpness is illustrated using an example of Nagata. Second, we show that there are no non-trivial tensor $t$-structures on the category of perfect complexes with cohomology supported on an irreducible closed subset if that subset is not contained in the regular locus of the scheme, which generalizes a result of Smith in the affine setting concerning a conjecture of Antieau, Gepner, and Heller.</description>
