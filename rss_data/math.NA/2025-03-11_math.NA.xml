      <title>Normalized Fourier-induced PINN method for solving the wave propagation equation in a non-unitized domain over an extended time range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for their simplicity and flexibility in engineering and scientific computing. In this study, we introduce a normalized PINN (NPINN) framework to solve a class of wave propagation equations in non-unitized domains over extended time ranges. This is achieved through a normalization technique that involves either spatial or temporal variable normalization. To enhance the capability of NPINN in solving wave equations, we integrate a Fourier-induced deep neural network as the solver, leading to a novel architecture termed NFPINN. Furthermore, we explore different normalization strategies for spatial and temporal variables and identify the optimal normalization approach for our method. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed NFPINN, we present numerical experiments in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces, considering regular and irregular domains. The results confirm the accuracy and stability of our approach.</description>

      <title>A computational model for crack-tip fields in a 3-D porous elastic solid with material moduli dependent on density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model for crack-tip fields is proposed in this paper for the response of a three-dimensional (3-D) porous elastic solid whose material moduli are dependent on the density. Such a description wherein the generalized Lam\`e coefficients are nonlinear functions of material stiffness is more realistic because most engineering materials are porous, and their material properties depend on porosity and density. The governing boundary value problem for the static equilibrium state in a 3-D, homogeneous, isotropic material is obtained as a second-order, quasilinear partial-differential-equation system with a classical traction-free crack-surface boundary condition. The numerical solution is obtained from a continuous trilinear Galerkin-type finite element discretization. A Picard-type linearization is utilized to handle the nonlinearities in the discrete problem. The proposed model can describe the state of stress and strain in various materials, including recovering the classical singularities in the linearized model. The role of \textit{tensile stress}, \textit{stress intensity factor} (SIF), and \textit{strain energy density} are examined. The results indicate that the maximum values of all these quantities occur directly before the crack-tip, consistent with the observation made in the canonical problem for the linearized elastic fracture mechanics. One can use the same classical local fracture criterion, like the maximum of SIF, to study crack tips' quasi-static and dynamic evolution within the framework described in this article.</description>

      <title>Adaptive SIPG method for approximations of boundary control problems governed by parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an aposteriori error analysis of adaptive finite element approximations of parabolic boundary control problems with bilateral box constraints that act on a Neumann boundary. The control problem is discretized using the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG) technique. We derive both reliable and efficient type residual-based error estimators coupling with the data oscillations. The implementation of these error estimators serves as a guide for the adaptive mesh refinement process, indicating whether or not more refinement is required. Although the control error estimator effectively captured control approximation errors, it had limitations in guiding refinement localization in critical cases. To overcome this, an alternative control indicator was used in numerical tests. The results demonstrated the clear superiority of adaptive refinements over uniform refinements, confirming the proposed approach's effectiveness in achieving accurate solutions while optimizing computational efficiency. numerical experiment showcases the effectiveness of the derived error estimators.</description>

      <title>Modified Hermite Radial Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interpolation of functions and derivatives is crucial in solving partial differential equations. Hermite Radial Basis Function (HRBF) methods improve accuracy by incorporating derivative information but suffer from ill-conditioning at low to moderate shape parameters for infinitely smooth kernels. This work proposes a Modified HRBF (MHRBF) method that introduces an additional polynomial to balance kernel behavior, improving accuracy while maintaining or lowering computational cost. The numerical results show that MHRBF achieves lower $L_{\infty}$--errors with fewer unknowns compared with the original HRBF, making it a robust alternative for stable and accurate RBF-based interpolation.</description>

      <title>Practical Topics in Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where data-driven decision-making and computational efficiency are paramount, optimization plays a foundational role in advancing fields such as mathematics, computer science, operations research, machine learning, and beyond. From refining machine learning models to improving resource allocation and designing efficient algorithms, optimization techniques serve as essential tools for tackling complex problems. This book aims to provide both an introductory guide and a comprehensive reference, equipping readers with the necessary knowledge to understand and apply optimization methods within their respective fields.
  Our primary goal is to demystify the inner workings of optimization algorithms, including black-box and stochastic optimizers, by offering both formal and intuitive explanations. Starting from fundamental mathematical principles, we derive key results to ensure that readers not only learn how these techniques work but also understand when and why to apply them effectively. By striking a careful balance between theoretical depth and practical application, this book serves a broad audience, from students and researchers to practitioners seeking robust optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Parameter-robust preconditioning for hybridizable symmetric discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybridizable discretizations allow for the elimination of local degrees-of-freedom leading to reduced linear systems. In this paper, we determine and analyse an approach to construct parameter-robust preconditioners for these reduced systems. Using the framework of Mardal and Winther (Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 18(1):1--40, 2011) we first determine a parameter-robust preconditioner for the full system. We then eliminate the local degrees-of-freedom of this preconditioner to obtain a preconditioner for the reduced system. However, not all reduced preconditioners obtained in this way are automatically robust. We therefore present conditions that must be satisfied for the reduced preconditioner to be robust. To demonstrate our approach, we determine preconditioners for the reduced systems obtained from hybridizable discretizations of the Darcy and Stokes equations. Our analysis is verified by numerical examples in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness of Lyapunov rank among symmetric cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyapunov rank of a cone is the dimension of the Lie algebra of its automorphism group. It is invariant under linear isomorphism and in general not unique - two or more non-isomorphic cones can share the same Lyapunov rank. It is therefore not possible in general to identify cones using Lyapunov rank. But suppose we look only among symmetric cones. Are there any that can be uniquely identified (up to isomorphism) by their Lyapunov ranks? We provide a complete answer for irreducible cones and make some progress in the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a modified nonlinear dynamic diffusion (DD) finite element method for convection-diffusion-reaction equations. This method is free of stabilization parameters and is capable of precluding spurious oscillations. We prove existence and, under an assumption of small mesh size, uniqueness of the discrete solution, and derive the optimal first order convergence rate of the approximation error in the energy norm plus a dissipation term. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>A quantitative sampling method for elastic and electromagnetic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to a novel sampling method for accurately reconstructing elastic and electromagnetic sources from the far field patterns. We show that the proposed indicators in the form of integrals with full far field patterns are exactly the source functions. These facts not only give constructive uniqueness proofs of the inverse source problems, but also establish the theoretical basis of the proposed sampling methods. Furthermore, we derive the stability estimates for the corresponding discrete indicators using the far field patterns with finitely many observations and frequencies. We have also proposed the indicators with partial far field patterns and proved their validity for providing the derivative information of the unknown sources. Numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed quantitative sampling method.</description>

      <title>An automatic approach to develop the fourth-order and L^2-stable lattice Boltzmann model for diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses how to develop a high-order multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) model for the general d(&gt;=1)-dimensional diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Such an MRT-LB model considers the transformation matrix constructed in a natural way and the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure. A key step in developing the high-order MRT-LB model is to determine the adjustable relaxation parameters and weight coefficients, which are used to eliminate the truncation errors at certain orders of the MRT-LB model, while ensuring the stability of the MRT-LB model. In this work, we first present a unified MRT-LB model for the diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Then, through the direct Taylor expansion, we analyze the macroscopic modified equations of the MRT-LB model up to fourth-order, and further derive the fourth-order consistent conditions of the MRT-LB model. Additionally, we also construct the fourth-order initialization scheme for the present LB method. After that, the condition which guarantees that the MRT-LB model can satisfy the stability structure is explicitly given, and from a numerical perspective, once the stability structure is satisfied, the MRT-LB model must be L^2 stable. In combination with the fourth-order consistent and L^2 stability conditions, the relaxation parameters and weight coefficients of the MRT-LB model can be automatically given by a simple computer code. Finally, we perform numerical simulations of several benchmark problems, and find that the numerical results can achieve a fourth-order convergence rate, which is in agreement with our theoretical analysis. In particular, for the isotropic diffusion equation, we also make a comparison between the fourth-order MRT-LB models with the DdQ(2d^2+1) and DdQ(2d+1) lattice structures, and the numerical results show that the MRT-LB model with the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice structure is more general.</description>

      <title>Existence, Stability and Uniqueness of the Integral Invariant in A Characteristic-type Semi-Lagrangian Discontinuous Galerkin Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characteristic Galerkin-type semi-Lagrangian discontinuous finite element scheme (CSLDG) is investigated, which directly discretizes an integral invariant model derived from the coupling of a transport equation and its dual equation. Despite extensive research on the numerical implementation of this method, no studies have yet explored the well-posedness of the integral invariant model itself. To address this gap, a weak solution theory for CSLDG is developed: A precise definition of the weak solution for the integral invariant model is formulated. Utilizing the slice method, which is frequently employed in existence proofs for parabolic equations, the existence of the weak solution is established through the application of the Riesz Representation Theorem and mollifier techniques. The stability of the integral invariant weak solution is subsequently demonstrated by the strategic selection of the test function Psi, leading to the proof of its uniqueness.</description>

      <title>An Optimally Convergent Split Parallel Algorithm for the Multiple-Network Poroelasticity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel split parallel algorithm for solving quasi-static multiple-network poroelasticity (MPET) equations. By introducing a total pressure variable, the MPET system can be reformulated into a coupled Stokes-parabolic system. To efficiently solve this system, we propose a split parallel approach. In the first time step, a monolithic solver is used to solve all variables simultaneously. For subsequent time steps, the system is split into a Stokes subproblem and a parabolic subproblem. These subproblems are then solved in parallel using a stabilization technique. This split parallel approach differs from sequential or iterative decoupling, significantly reducing computational time. The algorithm is proven to be unconditionally stable, optimally convergent, and robust across various parameter settings. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments. We also apply this parallel algorithm to simulate fluid-tissue interactions within the physiological environment of the human brain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study structure-preserving numerical methods for low Mach number barotropic Euler equations. Besides their asymptotic preserving properties that are crucial in order to obtain uniformly consistent and stable approximations of the Euler equations in their singular limit as the Mach number approaches zero, our aim is also to preserve discrete entropy stability. Suitable acoustic/advection splitting approach combined with time implicit-explicit approximations are used to achieve the asymptotic preserving property. The entropy stability of different space discretisation strategies is studied for different values of Mach number and is validated by the numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the piston effect in supercritical fluids via a reversible--irreversible vector field splitting-based explicit time integration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the liquid--vapor critical point, supercritical fluids behave strongly compressibly and, in parallel, thermophysical properties have strong state dependence. These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.</description>

      <title>An implicit shock tracking method for simulation of shock-dominated flows over complex domains using mesh-based parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mesh-based parametrization is a parametrization of a geometric object that is defined solely from a mesh of the object, e.g., without an analytical expression or computer-aided design (CAD) representation of the object. In this work, we propose a mesh-based parametrization of an arbitrary $d'$-dimensional object embedded in a $d$-dimensional space using tools from high-order finite elements. Using mesh-based parametrizations, we construct a boundary-preserving parametrization of the nodal coordinates of a computational mesh that ensures all nodes remain on all their original boundaries. These boundary-preseving parametrizations allow the nodes of the mesh to move only in ways that will not change the computational domain. They also ensure nodes will not move between boundaries, which would cause issues assigning boundary conditions for partial differential equation simulations and lead to inaccurate geometry representations for non-smooth boundary transitions. Finally, we integrate boundary-preserving, mesh-based parametrizations into high-order implicit shock tracking, an optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that moves nodes to align mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps, leaving the intra-element polynomial basis to represent smooth regions of the flow with high-order accuracy. Mesh-based parametrizations enable implicit shock tracking simulations of shock-dominated flows over geometries without simple analytical parametrizations. Several demonstrations of mesh-based parametrizations are provided.</description>

      <title>Satire: Computing Rigorous Bounds for Floating-Point Rounding Error in Mixed-Precision Loop-Free Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Techniques that rigorously bound the overall rounding error exhibited by a numerical program are of significant interest for communities developing numerical software. However, there are few available tools today that can be used to rigorously bound errors in programs that employ conditional statements (a basic need) as well as mixed-precision arithmetic (a direction of significant future interest) employing global optimization in error analysis. In this paper, we present a new tool that fills this void while also employing an abstraction-guided optimization approach to allow designers to trade error-bound tightness for gains in analysis time -- useful when searching for design alternatives. We first present the basic rigorous analysis framework of Satire and then show how to extend it to incorporate abstractions, conditionals, and mixed-precision arithmetic. We begin by describing Satire's design and its performance on a collection of benchmark examples. We then describe these aspects of Satire: (1) how the error-bound and tool execution time vary with the abstraction level; (2) the additional machinery to handle conditional expression branches, including defining the concepts of instability jumps and instability window widths and measuring these quantities; and (3) how the error changes when a mix of precision values are used. To showcase how \satire can add value during design, we start with a Conjugate Gradient solver and demonstrate how its step size and search direction are affected by different precision settings. Satire is freely available for evaluation, and can be used during the design of numerical routines to effect design tradeoffs guided by rigorous empirical error guarantees.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Reduced Rank Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced Rank Regression (RRR) is a widely used method for multi-response regression. However, RRR assumes a linear relationship between features and responses. While linear models are useful and often provide a good approximation, many real-world problems involve more complex relationships that cannot be adequately captured by simple linear interactions. One way to model such relationships is via multilinear transformations. This paper introduces Higher Order Reduced Rank Regression (HORRR), an extension of RRR that leverages multi-linear transformations, and as such is capable of capturing nonlinear interactions in multi-response regression. HORRR employs tensor representations for the coefficients and a Tucker decomposition to impose multilinear rank constraints as regularization akin to the rank constraints in RRR. Encoding these constraints as a manifold allows us to use Riemannian optimization to solve this HORRR problems. We theoretically and empirically analyze the use of Riemannian optimization for solving HORRR problems.</description>

      <title>First- and Half-order Schemes for Regime Switching Stochastic Differential Equation with Non-differentiable Drift Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An explicit first-order drift-randomized Milstein scheme for a regime switching stochastic differential equation is proposed and its bi-stability and rate of strong convergence are investigated for a non-differentiable drift coefficient.
  Precisely, drift is Lipschitz continuous while diffusion along with its derivative is Lipschitz continuous.
  Further, we explore the significance of evaluating Brownian trajectories at every switching time of the underlying Markov chain in achieving the convergence rate $1.0$ of the proposed scheme.
  In this context, possible variants of the scheme, namely modified randomized and reduced randomized schemes, are considered and their convergence rates are shown to be $1/2$.
  Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the convergence rates of these schemes along with their corresponding non-randomized versions.
  Further, it is illustrated that the half-order non-randomized reduced and modified schemes outperforms the classical Euler scheme.</description>

      <title>Simulating programmable morphing of shape memory polymer beam systems with complex geometry and topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to the analysis of programmable geometrically exact shear deformable beam systems made of shape memory polymers. The proposed method combines the viscoelastic Generalized Maxwell model with the Williams, Landel and Ferry relaxation principle, enabling the reproduction of the shape memory effect of structural systems featuring complex geometry and topology. Very high efficiency is pursued by discretizing the differential problem in space through the isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) method. The method, in addition to the desirable attributes of isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as exactness of the geometric reconstruction of complex shapes and high-order accuracy, circumvents the need for numerical integration since it discretizes the problem in the strong form. Other distinguishing features of the proposed formulation are: i) ${\rm SO}(3)$-consistency for the linearization of the problem and for the time stepping; ii) minimal (finite) rotation parametrization, that means only three rotational unknowns are used; iii) no additional unknowns are needed to account for the rate-dependent material compared to the purely elastic case. Through different numerical applications involving challenging initial geometries, we show that the proposed formulation possesses all the sought attributes in terms of programmability of complex systems, geometric flexibility, and high order accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider in this contribution a simplified idealized one-dimensional model in a nuclear core reactor coupling the diffusion equation on the neutron flux withthe enthalpy equation for the water which collects the heat produced by this idealized nuclear core. These equations are coupled through the dependency of thecoefficients of the diffusion equation in terms of the enthalpy. We propose a numerical method treating globally the coupled problem for finding its unique solution.Simultaneously, we use incomplete elliptic integrals to represent analytically the density of neutrons and the enthalpy in the fluid. Both methods lead to the samesolution with high accuracy. However, another quantity, generally used as a benchmark for comparing results, depends considerably on the approximation used forthe coefficients of the diffusion equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ParaTuck-2 decomposition (PT2D) of third-order tensor is a two-layer generalization of the well-known canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD).While being more flexible than the CPD, the PT2D also possesses similar uniqueness properties.In this paper, we show than under the best known uniqueness conditions, the exact PT2D can be computed by an algebraic algorithm (i.e., can the PT2D problems can be reduced to computing nullspaces and eigenvalues of certain matrices).We do so by lifting the slices of the tensor to higher-dimensional space, which also allows for refining the existing uniqueness conditions.The algorithms are developed for general PT2D and its symmetric version (DEDICOM), which leads to an algebraic algorithm for another generalization of the CPD, the PARAFAC2 decomposition.Our methods are also applicable in the approximation scenario, as shown by the numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A neural network kernel decomposition for learning multiple steady states in parameterized dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven machine learning approach to identifying parameters with steady-state solutions, locating such solutions, and determining their linear stability for systems of ordinary differential equations and dynamical systems with parameters. Our approach first constructs target functions for these tasks, then designs a parameter-solution neural network (PSNN) that couples a parameter neural network and a solution neural network to approximate the target functions. We further develop efficient algorithms to train the PSNN and locate steady-state solutions. An approximation theory for the target functions with PSNN is developed based on kernel decomposition. Numerical results are reported to show that our approach is robust in finding solutions, identifying phase boundaries, and classifying solution stability across parameter regions. These numerical results also validate our analysis. While this study focuses on steady states of parameterized dynamical systems, our approach is equation-free and is applicable generally to finding solutions for parameterized nonlinear systems of algebraic equations. Some potential improvements and future work are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards a fully well-balanced and entropy-stable scheme for the Euler equations with gravity: preserving isentropic steady solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work concerns the derivation of a numerical scheme to approximate weak solutions of the Euler equations with a gravitational source term. The designed scheme is proved to be fully well-balanced since it is able to exactly preserve all moving equilibrium solutions, as well as the corresponding steady solutions at rest obtained when the velocity vanishes. Moreover, the proposed scheme is entropy-preserving since it satisfies all fully discrete entropy inequalities. In addition, in order to satisfy the required admissibility of the approximate solutions, the positivity of both approximate density and pressure is established. Several numerical experiments attest the relevance of the developed numerical method. An extension to two-dimensional problems is given, applying the one-dimensional framework direction by direction on Cartesian grids.</description>

      <title>Structured Backward Errors for Special Classes of Saddle Point Problems with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of numerical analysis, the study of structured backward errors (BEs) in saddle point problems (SPPs) has shown promising potential for development. However, these investigations overlook the inherent sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix of the SPP. Moreover, the existing techniques are not applicable when the block matrices have circulant, Toeplitz, or symmetric-Toeplitz structures and do not even provide structure preserving minimal perturbation matrices for which the BE is attained. To overcome these limitations, we investigate the structured BEs of SPPs when the perturbation matrices exploit the sparsity pattern as well as circulant, Toeplitz, and symmetric-Toeplitz structures. Furthermore, we construct minimal perturbation matrices that preserve the sparsity pattern and the aforementioned structures. Applications of the developed frameworks are utilized to compute BEs for the weighted regularized least squares problem. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to validate our findings, showcasing the utility of the obtained structured BEs in assessing the strong backward stability of numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical proximal Galerkin: a fast $hp$-FEM solver for variational problems with pointwise inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We leverage the proximal Galerkin algorithm (Keith and Surowiec, Foundations of Computational Mathematics, 2024, DOI: 10.1007/s10208-024-09681-8), a recently introduced mesh-independent algorithm, to obtain a high-order finite element solver for variational problems with pointwise inequality constraints. This is achieved by discretizing the saddle point systems, arising from the latent variable proximal point method, with the hierarchical $p$-finite element basis. This results in discretized sparse Newton systems that admit a simple and effective block preconditioner. The solver can handle both obstacle-type, $u \leq \varphi$, and gradient-type, $|\nabla u| \leq \varphi$, constraints. We apply the resulting algorithm to solve obstacle problems with $hp$-adaptivity, a gradient-type constrained problem, and the thermoforming problem, an example of an obstacle-type quasi-variational inequality. We observe $hp$-robustness in the number of Newton iterations and only mild growth in the number of inner Krylov iterations to solve the Newton systems. Crucially we also provide wall-clock timings that are faster than low-order discretization counterparts.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Bfloat16, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics in Sparse Linear Solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving sparse linear systems lies at the core of numerous computational applications. Consequently, understanding the performance of recently proposed alternatives to the established IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, such as bfloat16 and the tapered-precision posit and takum machine number formats, is of significant interest. This paper examines these formats in the context of widely used solvers, namely LU, QR, and GMRES, with incomplete LU preconditioning and mixed precision iterative refinement (MPIR). This contrasts with the prevailing emphasis on designing specialized algorithms tailored to new arithmetic formats.
  This paper presents an extensive and unprecedented evaluation based on the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection -- a dataset of real-world matrices with diverse sizes and condition numbers. A key contribution is the faithful reproduction of SuiteSparse's UMFPACK multifrontal LU factorization and SPQR multifrontal QR factorization for machine number formats beyond single and double-precision IEEE 754. Tapered-precision posit and takum formats show better accuracy in direct solvers and reduced iteration counts in indirect solvers. Takum arithmetic, in particular, exhibits exceptional stability, even at low precision.</description>

      <title>BIAN: A Deep Learning Method to Solve Inverse Problems Using Only Boundary Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past years, inverse problems in partial differential equations have garnered increasing interest among scientists and engineers. However, due to the lack of conventional stability, nonlinearity and non-convexity, these problems are quite challenging and difficult to solve. In this work, we propose a new kind of neural network to solve the coefficient identification problems with only the boundary information. In this work, three networks has been utilized as an approximator, a generator and a discriminator, respectively. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the coefficients of interest have a complicated structure or are difficult to represent with traditional models. Comparative analysis against traditional coefficient estimation techniques demonstrates the superiority of our approach, not only handling highdimensional data and complex coefficient distributions adeptly by incorporating neural networks but also eliminating the necessity for extensive internal information due to the relationship between the energy distribution within the domain to the energy flux on the boundary. Several numerical examples have been presented to substantiate the merits of this algorithm including solving the Poisson equation and Helmholtz equation with spatially varying and piecewise uniform medium.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct an asymptotic-preserving neural networks (APNNs) [21] for the linearized Boltzmann equation in the acoustic scaling and with uncertain parameters. Utilizing the micro-macro decomposition, we design the loss function based on the stochastic-Galerkin system conducted from the micro-macro equations. Rigorous analysis is provided to show the capability of neural networks in approximating solutions near the global Maxwellian. By employing hypocoercivity techniques, we demonstrate two key results: the existence of APNNs when the loss function approaches zero, and the convergence of the APNN approximated solution as the loss tends to zero, with the error exhibiting an exponential decay in time.</description>

      <title>Median QMC method for unbounded integrands over $\mathbb{R}^s$ in unanchored weighted Sobolev spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration of Lebesgue integrable functions with respect to a density function over $\mathbb{R}^s$. We extend the construction-free median QMC rule to the unanchored weighted Sobolev space of functions defined over $\mathbb{R}^s$. By taking the median of $k=\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ independent randomized QMC estimators, we prove that for any $\epsilon\in(0,r-\frac{1}{2}]$, our method achieves a mean absolute error bound of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r+\epsilon})$, where $N$ is the number of points and $r&gt;\frac{1}{2}$ is a parameter determined by the function space. This rate matches that of the randomized lattice rules via component-by-component (CBC) construction, while our approach requires no specific CBC constructions or prior knowledge of the space's weight structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method attains accuracy comparable to the CBC method and outperforms the Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Get rid of your constraints and reparametrize: A study in NNLS and implicit bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past years, there has been significant interest in understanding the implicit bias of gradient descent optimization and its connection to the generalization properties of overparametrized neural networks. Several works observed that when training linear diagonal networks on the square loss for regression tasks (which corresponds to overparametrized linear regression) gradient descent converges to special solutions, e.g., non-negative ones. We connect this observation to Riemannian optimization and view overparametrized GD with identical initialization as a Riemannian GD. We use this fact for solving non-negative least squares (NNLS), an important problem behind many techniques, e.g., non-negative matrix factorization. We show that gradient flow on the reparametrized objective converges globally to NNLS solutions, providing convergence rates also for its discretized counterpart. Unlike previous methods, we do not rely on the calculation of exponential maps or geodesics. We further show accelerated convergence using a second-order ODE, lending itself to accelerated descent methods. Finally, we establish the stability against negative perturbations and discuss generalization to other constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Spherical Coordinates from Persistent Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a method to obtain spherical parameterizations of arbitrary data through the use of persistent cohomology and variational optimization. We begin by computing the second-degree persistent cohomology of the filtered Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex of a data set $X$ and extract a cocycle $\alpha$ from any significant feature. From this cocycle, we define an associated map $\alpha: VR(X) \to S^2$ and use this map as an infeasible initialization for a variational model, which we show has a unique solution (up to rigid motion). We then employ an alternating gradient descent/M\"{o}bius transformation update method to solve the problem and generate a more suitable, i.e., smoother, representative of the homotopy class of $\alpha$, preserving the relevant topological feature. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets to show the efficacy of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The Parametric Complexity of Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operator architectures employ neural networks to approximate operators mapping between Banach spaces of functions; they may be used to accelerate model evaluations via emulation, or to discover models from data. Consequently, the methodology has received increasing attention over recent years, giving rise to the rapidly growing field of operator learning. The first contribution of this paper is to prove that for general classes of operators which are characterized only by their $C^r$- or Lipschitz-regularity, operator learning suffers from a "curse of parametric complexity", which is an infinite-dimensional analogue of the well-known curse of dimensionality encountered in high-dimensional approximation problems. The result is applicable to a wide variety of existing neural operators, including PCA-Net, DeepONet and the FNO.The second contribution of the paper is to prove that this general curse can be overcome for solution operators defined by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation; this is achieved by leveraging additional structure in the underlying solution operator, going beyond regularity. To this end, a novel neural operator architecture is introduced, termed HJ-Net, which explicitly takes into account characteristic information of the underlying Hamiltonian system. Error and complexity estimates are derived for HJ-Net which show that this architecture can provably beat the curse of parametric complexity related to the infinite-dimensional input and output function spaces.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-von Mises theorems for time evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &amp;= f(u) \\ u(0) &amp;= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</description>

      <title>A semi-Lagrangian method for the direct numerical simulation of crystallization and precipitation at the pore scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new efficient particle method for the numerical simulation of crystallization and precipitation at the pore scale of real rock geometries extracted by X-Ray tomography. It is based on the coupling between superficial velocity models of porous media, Lagrangian description of chemistry using Transition-State-Theory, involving underlying grids. Its ability to successfully compute dissolution process has been established in the past and is presently generalized to precipitation and crystallization by means of adsorption modeling. Numerical simulations of mineral CO2 trapping are provided, showing evidence of clogging/non-clogging regimes, and one of the main results is the introduction of a new non-dimensional number needed for this characterization.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy Class of $C_0$-semigroups on Hilbert Spaces and Their Application to Decay Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate immediately differentiable $C_0$-semigroups $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\sup_{0 &lt; t &lt;1} t^{1/\beta}\|Ae^{-tA}\| &lt; \infty$ for some $0 &lt; \beta \leq 1$. Such $C_0$-semigroups are referred to as the Crandall--Pazy class of $C_0$-semigroups. In the Hilbert space setting, we present two characterizations of the Crandall--Pazy class. We then apply these characterizations to estimate decay rates for Crank--Nicolson schemes with smooth initial data when the associated abstract Cauchy problem is governed by an exponentially stable $C_0$-semigroup in the Crandall--Pazy class. The first approach is based on a functional calculus called the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus. The second approach builds upon estimates derived from Lyapunov equations and improves the decay estimate obtained in the first approach, under the additional assumption that $-A^{-1}$ generates a bounded $C_0$-semigroup.</description>

      <title>Extending the Lattice Boltzmann Method to Non-linear Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work outlines a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for geometrically and constitutively nonlinear solid mechanics to simulate large deformations under dynamic loading conditions. The method utilizes the moment chain approach, where the non-linear constitutive law is incorporated via a forcing term. Stress and deformation measures are expressed in the reference configuration. Finite difference schemes are employed for gradient and divergence computations, and Neumann- and Dirichlet-type boundary conditions are introduced.
  Numerical studies are performed to assess the proposed method and illustrate its capabilities. Benchmark tests for weakly dynamic uniaxial tension and simple shear across a range of Poisson's ratios demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme and serve as validation of the implementation. Furthermore, a dynamic test case involving the propagation of bending waves in a cantilever beam highlights the potential of the method to model complex dynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Identification of Feasible Regions Using R-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of flexibility analysis is to identify and define the feasibility region, which represents the range of operational conditions (e.g., variations in process parameters) that ensure safe, reliable, and feasible process performance. This work introduces a novel flexibility analysis method that requires only that model constraints (e.g., defining product Critical Quality Attributes or process Key Performance Indicators) be explicitly provided or approximated by a closed-form function, such as a multivariate polynomial model. The method is based on V.L. Rvachev's R-functions, enabling an explicit analytical representation of the feasibility region without relying on complex optimization-based approaches. R-functions offer a framework for describing intricate geometric shapes and performing operations on them using implicit functions and inequality constraints. The theory of R-functions facilitates the identification of feasibility regions through algebraic manipulation, making it a more practical alternative to traditional optimization-based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a suite of well-known test cases from the literature.</description>
