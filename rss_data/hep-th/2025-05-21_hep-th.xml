      <title>Magnetised Bounds for Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspects of parity-preserving, three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with a global $U(1)$ symmetry in the presence of a background magnetic field are investigated. A local effective action is constructed to four-derivative order, based on an assumption that the magnetic field drives the theory into a gapped phase. This action is evaluated in a variety of backgrounds, and is used to obtain one- and two-point functions of the conserved current and stress-energy tensor. Dispersive arguments are developed and shown to impose powerful constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the effective action, leading to universal predictions for the CFT response at large magnetic field and the scaling dimensions of background monopole operators. These general results are further examined through explicit calculations in the free complex scalar, free Dirac fermion, and a holographic Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell model.</description>

      <title>Constraints are not enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action is well-known to be unbounded below and thus to raise many questions regarding the definition of the gravitational path integral. A variety of works since the late 1980's have suggested that this problem disappears when one fixes a foliation of the spacetime and imposes the corresponding gravitational constraints. However, we show here that this approach fails with various classes of boundary conditions imposed on the foliation: compact slices without boundary, asymptotically flat, or asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter slices. We also discuss the idea of fixing the scalar curvature and Wick-rotating the conformal factor, and show that it also fails to produce an action bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of BPS black holes in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover novel features in the spectrum of BPS and near-BPS states in asymptotically $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ spacetimes. This follows from a careful analysis of semiclassical and quantum black holes in this theory, which have peculiarities due to the nonlinear large $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry. Notably, we find that the $S^3 \times S^3$ angular momentum spectrum of BPS states in the Ramond sector exhibits discrete jumps as a function of the ratio between the radii of the two three-spheres. This phenomenon is a quantum gravity effect for which no microscopic derivation is currently known. In addition, we construct a family of non-extremal supersymmetric black holes that contribute to a supersymmetric index yet possess a temperature-dependent free energy. Analogous results apply to six-dimensional black holes with $AdS_2 \times S^2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometries constructed in M-theory compactifications.</description>

      <title>On the Present Status of Inflationary Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Proton Structure Functions from Holographic Einstein-Dilaton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the proton structure functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the context of holography. We develop a general framework that extends previous holographic calculations of $F_1$ and $F_2$ to the case where the bulk geometry stems from bottom-up Einstein-Dilaton models, which are commonly used in the literature to describe some properties of QCD in the strong coupling regime. We focus on a choice of the dilaton potential that leads to a holographic model able to reproduce known lattice QCD results for the glueball masses at zero temperature and pure Yang-Mills thermodynamics above deconfinement. Once the parameters of the background holographic model are fixed, we introduce probe fermionic and gauge fields in the bulk {\it a la} Polchinski and Strassler to determine the corresponding structure functions. This particular realization of the model can successfully describe the proton mass and provide results for $F_2$ at large $x$ that are in qualitative agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>On the Sign of the Casimir Force Between Two Bodies Coupled to a Dirac field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the result of Kenneth and I. Klich, Phys. Rev. Lett.97, 160401 (2006) to derive a theorem for two objects coupled to a Dirac field. We demonstrate that a sufficient condition for the Casimir interaction to be repulsive, is for their geometric configuration to be odd under the same reflection operation considered in that work.</description>

      <title>A new scale anomaly in Dirac matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of Dirac semimetals is modeled at low energies by the massless Dirac Hamiltonian with the Fermi velocity replacing the velocity of light. The classical action is scale invariant. In 3D materials, Coulomb interactions induce a conformal anomaly associated to the charge renormalization already known in quantum field theory. In this work, we describe a new conformal anomaly induced by the running of the Fermi velocity that applies to Dirac semimetals in two and three dimensions. The case of graphene is particularly interesting. We analyze the anomaly and explore its thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consequences. The anomaly modifies the propagation speed of hydrodynamic sound waves, alters the thermodynamic equation of state, and induces a non-vanishing bulk viscosity proportional to the beta function of the Fermi velocity.</description>

      <title>Response of Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum to deformations of rugby-ball compact space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the response of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass spectrum to various deformations of the rugby-ball background in 6-dimensional supergravity. We derived the mode equations that contain the 3-dimensional scale factor and the lapse function. By solving these, we numerically evaluate the KK masses for a bulk scalar and a spinor when the background has a nontrivial dependence on the position in the compact space. We clarify some qualitative features of the spectrum deformation for some perturbations of the rugby-ball background. For perturbations of a supersymmetric background, we find that the mass-splitting between bosonic and fermionic modes is much smaller than the deviation from the values of the supersymmetric mass eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present twistor BV actions that encompasses many classically consistent bosonic holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories with vanishing cosmological constant. Upon quantization, these actions are shown to be quantum consistent, i.e. no gauge anomaly, for some subclasses of twistorial higher-spin theories. Anomaly-free twistorial theories can be identified through an index theorem, which is a higher-spin extension of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem. We also discuss the anomaly cancellation mechanisms on twistor space to render anomalous theories quantum consistent at one loop.</description>

      <title>An Ode to the Penrose and Witten transforms in Twistor space for 3D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we discuss the construction of Sp$(4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant objects in the twistor space for three dimensional conformal field theories. The Sp$(4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant projective delta function, alongside the Twistor symplectic dot product invariants form the basis for conformal Wightman functions involving conserved currents and $\Delta=1$ scalars. For correlators involving scalars with $\Delta\ne 1$, generic spinning primaries and parity odd correlators we show that the infinity twistor of $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ must be incorporated into the analysis. We show that this feature can be traced to the Penrose and Witten transforms of these operators that we derive. We then discuss the super-twistor space construction and derive the supersymmetric Penrose transform for $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories using the Fourier transform and the supersymmetric Witten transform. We construct OSp$(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ invariants and its application to several super-Wightman functions. Similar to the non supersymmetric case, we find an important role played by the (super) infinity twistor which we exemplify through parity odd super-correlators and a supersymmetric contact term.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect for scalar field rotating on a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum energy of a scalar field rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ on a disk of radius $R$ and with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The rotation is introduced by a metric obtained by a Galilean transformation from a rest frame. The constraint $\Omega R&lt;c$ must be obeyed to maintain causality. To compute the vacuum energy, we use an imaginary frequency representation and the well-known uniform asymptotic expansion of the Bessel function. We use the zeta-functional regularization and separate the divergent contributions, which we discuss in terms of the heat kernel coefficients. The divergences are found to be independent of rotation. The renormalized finite part of the vacuum energy is negative and becomes more negative for larger rotation frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an infinitesimal approach, this work addresses the renormalization problem to deal with the ultraviolet divergences arising in quantum field theory. Under the assumption that the action has already been renormalized to yield an ultraviolet-finite effective action that satisfies a certain set of renormalization conditions, we analyze how the action must be adjusted to reproduce a first-order change in these renormalization conditions. The analysis then provides the change that is induced on the correlation functions of the theory. This program is successfully carried out in the case of super-renormalizable theories, namely, a scalar field with cubic interaction in four space-time dimensions and with quartic interaction in three space-time dimensions. Relying on existing results in the theory of perturbative renormalization, we derive explicit renormalized expressions for these theories, each of which involves only a finite number of graphs constructed with full propagators and full $n$-point vertices. The renormalizable case is analyzed as well; the derived expressions are ultraviolet finite as the regulator is removed but cannot be written without a regulator. In this sense, the renormalization is not fully explicit in the renormalizable case. Nevertheless, a perturbative solution of the equations starting from the free theory provides the renormalized Feynman graphs, similar to the BPHZ program. For compatibility with the preservation of the renormalization conditions, a projective renormalization scheme, as opposed to a minimal one, is also introduced. The ideas developed are extended to the study of the renormalization of composite operators and the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>Duality and four-dimensional black holes: gravitational waves, algebraically special solutions, pole skipping, and the spectral duality relation in holographic thermal CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of gravitational waves and other classical fields on specifically four-dimensional backgrounds of black holes exhibits electric-magnetic-like dualities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of such dualities in terms of geometrical quantities with a physically-intuitive interpretation. In turn, we explain the interplay between the algebraic structure of black hole spacetimes and their associated dualities. For large classes of black hole geometries, explicit constructions are presented. We then use these results and apply them to the holographic study of three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), discussing how such dualities place stringent constraints on the thermal spectra of correlators. In particular, the dualities enforce the recently-developed spectral duality relation along with a multitude of implications for the physics of thermal CFTs. A number of numerical results supporting our conclusions is also presented, including a demonstration of how the longitudinal spectrum of quasinormal modes determines the transverse spectrum, and vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes present a comprehensive analysis of shockwave geometries in holographic settings, focusing on $\textrm{T}\overline{\textrm{T}}$-deformed BTZ black holes and their extensions. By constructing deformed metrics and employing Kruskal coordinates, we examine out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) as probes of quantum chaos. We also study localized shockwave solutions and analyze their backreaction, highlighting regimes in which the Mezei-Stanford bound on the butterfly velocity is potentially violated. The results obtained via shockwave methods are corroborated with recent developments in pole-skipping phenomena and the entanglement wedge approach, demonstrating consistency among distinct probes of chaos in holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Strings and near-extremal black holes in theories with large $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-loop partition function of superstrings in the $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathbf{S}^3 \times \mathbf{S}^3 \times \mathbf{S}^1$ background. Specifically, we show that the supergravity spectrum, which contains non-chiral primary states unlike other similar $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ backgrounds, can be recovered by this partition function in the semiclassical limit. We also show how the boundary currents are encoded in the string spectrum. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of these boundary currents in the quantum partition function of near-extremal black holes in theories with large $\mathcal{N} = (4,4)$ supersymmetry, recovering results consistent with the analysis of the near-horizon (super-)Schwarzian theory. In particular, we show how the BPS index of the large $\mathcal{N} = (4,4)$ theory, which turns out to be temperature dependent, captures the spectrum of excitations around supersymmetric BTZ black holes. Finally, we comment on the limit when the AdS curvature radius is string scale, which is directly accessible within the RNS formalism for this compactification. The spectrum of the limiting theory we obtain differs from the tensionless string spectrum derived in the literature, suggesting that there is not a unique worldsheet CFT for this value of parameters.</description>

      <title>On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.</description>

      <title>Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary, an important general problem in theoretical and mathematical physics. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory. We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory that associates to a 3-manifold a collection of $q$-series invariants labeled by Spin$^c$ structures, for which crossing the natural boundary corresponds to orientation reversal of the 3-manifold. Our new resurgent perspective leads to a practical numerical algorithm that generates $q$-series which are dual to unary $q$-series composed of false theta functions. Until recently, these duals were only known in a limited number of cases, essentially based on Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and the common belief was that the more general duals might not even exist. Resurgence analysis identifies as primary objects Mordell integrals: transforms of resurgent functions. Their unique Borel summed transseries decomposition on either side of the Stokes line is the unique decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The latter are combinations of unary $q$-series in terms of $q$ and its modular counterpart $\tilde{q}$, and are resurgent by construction. The Mordell integral is analytic across the natural boundary of the $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ series, and uniqueness of a similar decomposition which preserves algebraic relations on the other side of the boundary defines the unique boundary crossing of the $q$ series. This continuation can be efficiently implemented numerically. This identifies known unique mock modular identities, and extends well beyond. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>A Renormalizable Model of Quantized Gravitational and Matter Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Lagrange multiplier field can be used to restrict radiative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action to one-loop order. This result is employed to show that it is possible to couple a scalar field to the metric (graviton) field in such a way that the model is both renormalizable and unitary. The usual Einstein equations of motion for the gravitational field are recovered, perturbatively, in the classical limit. By evaluating the generating functional of proper Green's functions in closed form, one obtains a novel analytic contribution to the effective action.</description>

      <title>Canonical Differential Equations for Cosmology from Positive Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions are central observables in modern cosmology, as they encode properties of the early universe. In this paper, we derive novel canonical differential equations for wavefunction coefficients in power-law FRW cosmologies by combining positive geometries and the combinatorics of tubings of Feynman graphs. First, we establish a general method to derive differential equations for any function given as a twisted integral of a logarithmic differential form. By using this method on a natural set of functions labelled by tubings of a given Feynman diagram, we derive a closed set of differential equations in the canonical form. The coefficients in these equations are related to region variables with the same notion of tubings, providing a uniform combinatorial description of the system of equations. We provide explicit results for specific examples and conjecture that this approach works for any graph.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in general symmetric teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the polarization modes of gravitational waves within the most general symmetric teleparallel gravity theory that allows for second-order field equations We consider both scenarios where test particles either carry or do not carry a hypermomentum charge. Our findings reveal the existence of tensor, vector, and scalar modes of gravitational waves. Firstly, the theory supports the + and $\times$ tensor modes propagating at the speed of light. Secondly, in the case where particles do not carry hypermomentum, vector modes propagating at the speed of light exist only within a very specific parameter space. However, when particles do carry hypermomentum, there are two shear modes that propagate at the speed of light, while the vector-$x$ and vector-$y$ modes emerge only under very specific conditions. Thirdly, in the presence of hypermomentum, there is always a longitudinal mode propagating at the speed of light. The universal existence of the shear modes and the longitudinal mode in the presence of hypermomentum is a key feature of symmetric teleparallel gravity, distinguishing it from the Riemannian framework through gravitational wave polarization detection. We also analyze the polarization modes in two widely studied special theories: $f(Q)$ theory and quadratic non-metricity theory. Our study reveals that, within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework, it is crucial to assume that matter fields are independent of the connection, as any dependence would lead to unphysical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gauge-theoretical method introduced in our previous paper is applied to solving the axisymmetric and static Einstein-Maxwell equations. We obtain the solutions of non-Weyl class, where the gravitational and electric or magnetic potentials are not functionally related. In the electrostatic case, we show that the obtained solution coincides with the solution given by Bonnor in 1979. In the magnetostatic case, we present a solution describing the gravitational field created by two magnetically charged masses. In this solution, we show a case where the Dirac string does not stretch to spatial infinity but lies between the magnetically charged masses.</description>

      <title>Super-entropic black holes in gravity's rainbow and determining constraints on rainbow functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the application of the inverse isoperimetric inequality to establish constraints on the parameters of gravity's rainbow. We investigate the thermodynamic (in)stability conditions for $d-$dimensional energy-dependent black holes, which are recognized as $d-$ dimensional black holes within the framework of gravity's rainbow. To achieve this, we calculate thermodynamic quantities such as Hawking temperature, entropy, total mass, and heat capacity in both extended and non-extended phase spaces for these black holes. We assess the physical and stable regions by utilizing these thermodynamic quantities alongside the inverse isoperimetric inequality, aiming to determine constraints on the rainbow functions. Finally, we show that by considering a constraint on the rainbow function, these black holes satisfy the super-entropic condition.</description>

      <title>String-Membrane-Nets from Higher-Form Gauging: An Alternate Route to $p$-String Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on the $p$-string condensation procedure for constructing 3+1D fracton phases by implementing this process via the gauging of higher-form symmetries. Specifically, we show that gauging a 1-form symmetry in 3+1D that is generated by Abelian anyons in isotropic stacks of 2+1D topological orders naturally results in a 3+1D $p$-string condensed phase, providing a controlled non-perturbative construction that realizes fracton orders. This approach clarifies the symmetry principles underlying $p$-string condensation and generalizes the familiar connection between anyon condensation and one-form gauging in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly in both field theories and lattice models: in field theory, we derive the foliated field theory description of the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ X-Cube model by gauging a higher-form symmetry in stacks of 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories; on the lattice, we show how gauging a diagonal 1-form symmetry in isotropic stacks of $G$-graded string-net models leads to string-membrane-nets hosting restricted mobility excitations. This perspective naturally generalizes to spatial dimensions $d \geq 2$ and provides a step towards building an algebraic theory of $p$-string condensation.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

Abstract: We integrate the notion of an effective field theory, as described by Costello, with the framework of noncommutative symplectic geometry introduced by Kontsevich; providing a definition for the renormalization group flow in noncommutative geometry that is defined through the use of ribbon graphs. As in the commutative case, the resulting noncommutative effective field theories are in one-to-one correspondence with local interaction functionals. We explain how in this setting, the large $N$ correspondence discovered by 't Hooft appears as a relation between noncommutative and commutative effective field theories. As an example, we apply this framework to study a noncommutative analogue of Chern-Simons theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the string theory dynamics of the volume scalar rolling down an exponential potential during the period between inflation and reheating, in a background of cosmic superstring loops. In the context of the LVS potential, we demonstrate the existence of a novel string loop attractor tracker solution, in which 75% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of a gas of fundamental cosmic superstring loops (a configuration preferred over the standard radiation tracker). On this tracker, it is the continual reduction in the string tension as the volume scalar evolves that makes the loops stable against decay. For more general non-LVS potentials, mixed radiation-loop trackers can also occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was proposed that five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Moreover, it was shown that 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Here we compute the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and show that unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances, due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times. Moreover there is an additional enhancement in the squeezed limit.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we study the holographic CFT in the de Sitter static patch at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential. We find that butterfly velocity $v_B$ in such field theory degenerates for all values of the Hubble parameter $H$ and $T$. We interpret this as a chaos disruption caused by the interplay between the expansion of chaotic correlations constrained by $v_B$ and effects caused by de Sitter curvature. The chemical potential restores healthy butterfly velocity for some range of temperatures. Also, we provide some analogy of this chaos suppression with the Schwinger effect in de Sitter and black hole formation from shock wave collision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a model for quantum gravity based on the local Lorentz symmetry and general coordinate invariance. A key idea is the irreversible vierbein postulate that a tree-level action for the model at a certain energy scale does not contain an inverse vierbein. Under this postulate, only the spinor becomes a dynamical field, and no gravitational background field is introduced in the tree-level action. In this paper, after explaining the transformation rules of the local Lorentz and general-coordinate transformations in detail, a tree-level action is defined. We show that fermionic fluctuations can induce a nonvanishing gravitational background field.</description>

Abstract: It has been suggested that a $dS_{d+1}$ spacetime of radius $R_{ds}$ has a holographic dual, living at future space-like infinity ${\cal I}^+$, with the bulk wave function being dual to the partition function of the boundary theory, [arXiv:astro-ph/0210603v5]. We consider some aspects of this correspondence. For under damped scalars with mass $M^2R_{ds}^2&gt;{d^2\over4}$, belonging to the principal series, we show that for the Bunch Davies vacuum a suitable source in the boundary theory can be identified in terms of the coherent state representation of the wave function. We argue that terms in the resulting correlation functions, which are independent of the late time cut-off, satisfy the Ward identities of a conformal field theory. We also discuss other ways to identify sources, both in the under damped and the over damped case, where $M^2R_{ds}^2&lt;{d^2\over4}$, and argue that these too can lead to correlators satisfying the Ward identities of a CFT. Some comments on the violation of reflection positivity, and the cut-off dependent terms, along with some explicit checks and sample calculations, are also included.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Hawking radiation in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for minimally coupled massless and massive scalar fields. We employ a holography-inspired technique to derive the Bogoliubov coefficients. We consider both black holes in equilibrium and black holes attached to a bath. In the latter case, we compute semiclassical deviations from the thermal spectrum.</description>

      <title>Strings in AdS$_3$: one-loop partition function and near-extremal BTZ thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of the string partition function in AdS$_3$ focussing on the appearance of spacetime (super) symmetries. We show how the asymptotic symmetries of the AdS$_3$ spacetime, which generate the boundary (super) Virasoro currents, are captured by the one-loop partition sum. We use this to argue that the recent understanding of near-extremal black hole thermodynamics based on the gravitational path integral continues to hold for finite string length. Along the way we clarify some aspects of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality and, in particular, deduce which bulk gauge fields lead to boundary currents. We also explain how one can interpolate between supersymmetric and thermal (Atick-Witten) fermion boundary conditions in the target space by suitably tuning rotational chemical potentials in the string partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fubini-Study metric is a central element of information geometry. We explore the role played by information geometry for determining the circuit complexity of Virasoro circuits and their deformations. To this effect, we study unitary quantum circuits generated by the Virasoro algebra and Fourier modes of a primary operator. Such primary-deformed Virasoro circuits can be realized in two-dimensional conformal field theories, where they provide models of inhomogeneous global quenches. We consider a cost function induced by the Fubini-Study metric and provide a universal expression for its time-evolution to quadratic order in the primary deformation for general source profiles. For circuits generated by the Virasoro zero mode and a primary, we obtain a non-zero cost only if spatial inhomogeneities are sufficiently large. In this case, we find that the cost saturates when the source becomes time-independent. The exact saturation value is determined by the history of the source profile. As a byproduct, returning to undeformed circuits, we relate the Fubini-Study metric to the K\"ahler metric on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ER=EPR conjecture states that quantum entanglement between boundary degrees of freedom leads to the emergence of bulk spacetime itself. Although this has been tested extensively in String Theory for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, its implications for an accelerating universe, such as our own, remain less explored. Assuming a cosmic version of ER=EPR for de Sitter space, we explore computational complexity corresponding to long-range entanglement responsible for bulk states on spacelike hypersurfaces. Rather remarkably, we find that the complexity (per unit volume) of the Euclidean vacuum, as an entangled state over two boundary CFT vacua, is finite both in the UV and the IR, which provides additional evidence for cosmic ER=EPR. Our result seems to be a universal feature of spacetimes with horizons and, moreover, hints at new features of the thermofield double state for studying thermalization of any quantum system.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall vacuum decay in the presence of a compact dimension meets the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposal of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant in the late universe, mirroring a transition from anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) space, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a compelling framework for ameliorating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. An attractive theoretical realisation that accommodates the AdS $\to$ dS transition relies on the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk of a 5-dimensional (5-dim) set up. Among the fields characterising the dark sector, there is a real scalar field $\phi$ endowed with a potential holding two local minima with very small difference in vacuum energy and bigger curvature (mass) of the lower one. Shortly after the false vacuum tunnels to its true vacuum state, $\phi$ becomes more massive and its contribution to the Casimir energy becomes exponentially suppressed. The tunneling process then changes the difference between the total number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom contributing to the quantum corrections of the vacuum energy, yielding the AdS $\to$ dS transition. We investigate the properties of this theoretical realisation to validate its main hypothesis and characterise free parameters of the model. We adopt the Coleman-de Luccia formalism for calculating the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation. We show that the Euclidean bounce configuration that drives the transition between $\phi$ vacua has associated at least a sixth order potential. We also show that distinctive features of the required vacuum decay to accommodate the AdS $\to$ dS transition are inconsistent with a 5-dim non-compact description of the instanton, for which the bounce is $O(5)$ symmetric, and instead call for a 5-dim instanton with a compact dimension, for which the bounce is $O(4)\times U(1)$ symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. We find signatures of chaos in energetically disfavored string configurations, that are closer to the horizon, whereas no chaos is observed in energetically favored string configurations that are away from the horizon. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. The reported Lyapunov exponents are consistent with a classical analogue of the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and we find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

Abstract: We derive the kinematic numerator factors for heavy-mass effective field theory from the field theory limit of the string theory vertex operator kinematic algebra introduced in arXiv:1806.09584. The kinematic numerators are derived as correlators of nested commutators of gluon vertex operators evaluated between massive tachyonic vertex operators. The resulting numerators are given by products of structure constants of the vertex operator algebra which yield gauge invariant expressions. The computation of the nested commutators leads to a natural organisation in the form of rooted trees, endowed with an order that facilitates the enumeration of the various contributions. This kinematic algebra gives a string theory understanding of the field theory fusion rules for constructing the heavy-mass effective field theory numerator of arXiv:2104.11206 and arXiv:2111.15649.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the information degradation in a massive Unruh-DeWitt theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of the massive scalar field on the information degradation concerning the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. In this conjecture, we adopted a system with a finite and large interaction time. To accomplish our purpose, one examines the quantum coherence of a uniformly accelerated qubit and the probability of finding the detector in the ground state. In this framework, we consider a quantum interferometric circuit to obtain the probability, visibility, and coherence. Naturally, these measurements provide us with wave-like information. Besides, one modifies the circuit to describe the path distinguishability and the particle-like information. These results are promising, as they allow us to understand the influence of the Unruh effect on the wave-particle duality. Thus, our findings announce that the increase in the scalar field mass induces a decrease in information degradation. Finally, we noted that the information concerning the Unruh effect remains preserved when $m \geq \Omega$. Therefore, the detector cannot absorb particles with mass equal to or greater than its energy gap. These results indicate that the scalar field mass is a protective factor against information degradation for systems under high acceleration conditions.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation, and found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation between the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the square of the power spectrum. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs which is the finiteness of the relevant observables in these limits, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.</description>

      <title>Scalar Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper it is initiated the systematic study of thermal field theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. The focus here is on scalar fields, although some results also apply to fields with arbitrary spins. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Moreover, path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. It is shown that, while the average angular momentum, like the chemical potentials, does not contribute positively to the Euclidean action, its negative contributions can be compensated by some other contributions that are instead positive, at least in some cases. As an application of the developed general formalism, it is shown that the production of particles weakly coupled to a rotating plasma can be significantly enhanced compared to the non-rotating case. The Higgs boson production through a portal coupling to a dark sector in the early universe is studied in some detail. The findings of this paper can also be useful, for example, to investigate the physics of rotating stars, ordinary and primordial black holes and more exotic compact objects.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational path integral on $S^2 \times S^2$ can be interpreted either as evaluating a contribution to the norm of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction conditional on spatial $S^1 \times S^2$ topology, or the pair creation rate of black holes in de Sitter. Both interpretations are distinguished at the quantum level. The former requires the path integral to be real and the latter to be imaginary. We develop a formalism to efficiently compute the phase of the gravitational path integral on Einstein spaces. We apply it to a broad class of spacetimes and in particular $S^2\times S^{D-2}$, finding it to be real and positive. We generalize some of the analysis to cases with charge and rotation.</description>

Abstract: In this research, the particle mass hierarchy within the electroweak theory is investigated without introducing symmetry extensions. The multiplicative form of the Higgs Lagrangian, derived via the inverse problem of calculus of variations, is employed to calculate the fermion mass spectrum, the weak mixing angle, and $W/Z$ masses, where the SU(2) and U(1) gauge couplings are identical and all Yukawa couplings can be equal to the Higgs self couplings. In the large background field limit, all particles-including the electron, $W/Z$-boson, and Higgs boson-decouple and the Lagrangian reduces to massive free fields. We also explore the potential implications of these results to incorporate with the quark mass matrix structure, the hierarchy problem and the one-loop effective potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</description>

Abstract: In the well-studied genus zero case, bases of $\mathrm{d}\log$ integrands with integer leading singularities define Feynman integrals that automatically satisfy differential equations in canonical form. Such integrand bases can be constructed without input from the differential equations and without explicit involvement of dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$. We propose a generalization of this construction to genus one geometry arising from the appearance of elliptic curves. We argue that a particular choice of algebraic one-forms of the second kind that avoids derivatives is crucial. We observe that the corresponding Feynman integrals satisfy a special form of differential equations that has not been previously reported, and that their solutions order by order in $\epsilon$ yield pure functions. We conjecture that our integrand-level construction universally leads to such differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We study electric-magnetic duality in Lorentz invariant symmetric tensor gauge theories, where immobile charged particles - fractons - arise due to the generalized current conservation $\partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} J^{\mu \nu} = 0$ and the fracton gauge principle. We show that the duality in the symmetric gauge theories holds only in four-dimensional spacetime. In higher dimensions, the duality does not hold with only the symmetric gauge fields but tensor fields with more complex symmetries come into play. Furthermore, we show that a hierarchy for the symmetric gauge field theories of higher ranks is interpreted by the bi-form calculus. We also discuss the restricted immobility of $p$-branes in the mixed symmetric gauge theories. As a byproduct, we find that novel self-duality conditions are defined as BPS equations in the four-dimensional Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime (2nd Edition)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14517v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group-Improved Gravitational Action: A Lagrangian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new approach for embedding the renormalization group running of Newton's constant and cosmological constant in gravity is proposed. This approach is based on a gravitational Lagrangian that gives rise to a new class of modified gravity theories where $G$ and $\Lambda$ are spacetime-dependent functions. The Lagrangian formulation can be interpreted as an effective gravitational action that encapsulates the scale dependence of $G$ and $\Lambda$, arising from quantum effects in the early universe. We show that the new formalism can be discussed using partially the framework and results of Horndeski modified gravity, excluding the equations of motion of the scalar field. The study explores aspects of this new gravity action. We also analyze an interesting non-singular cosmological solution featuring power-law inflation and we discuss the generation of scalar and tensor perturbations within this framework.</description>

      <title>Self-Excited Gravitational Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to constructing gravitational instantons based on the observation that the gravitational action of general relativity in its teleparallel formulation can be expressed as a product of the torsion and excitation forms. We introduce a new class of solutions where these two forms are equal, which we term the self-excited instantons, and advocate for their use over the self-dual instantons of Eguchi and Hanson. These new self-excited instantons exhibit striking similarities to BPST instantons in Yang-Mills theory, as their action reduces to a topological Nieh-Yan term, which allows us to identify the axial torsion as a topological current and show that the gravitational action is given by a topological charge.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>On symmetry-resolved generalized entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <title>NNLOCAL: completely local subtractions for color-singlet production in hadron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present NNLOCAL, a proof-of-concept parton-level Monte Carlo program implementing the extension of the completely local subtraction scheme CoLoRFulNNLO to the case of color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We have built general local subtraction terms that regularize all single and double unresolved infrared singularities in real radiation phase space. The subtractions are then integrated fully analytically to the required order in the parameter of dimensional regularization. Combining the integrated counterterms with the virtual contributions we demonstrate the cancellation of all infrared poles explicitly. We validate our procedure by computing the fully differential cross section for the production of a Higgs boson at the LHC in an effective field theory with gluons only. Our code provides the first public implementation of a completely local analytic subtraction scheme at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lattice random walks and quantum A-period conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) through Gedankenexperiments involving black hole perturbations induced by test particles. Our approach allows for the calculation of perturbations to any order for a general class of black holes that admit the zero-temperature extremal limit. We find that the WCCC for extremal and near-extremal black holes is hinged upon the positive sign of only one quantity, namely $W=\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{Q_\alpha ; T=0}$, which is indeed positive for all the well-known black holes.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3 standard sirens and strong lensing time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong gravitational lensing (SGL) system RXJ1131-1231 and constrain the Hubble constant ($H_0$) via the distance sum rule, without assuming a specific cosmological model. For $\Omega_K = 0$, we obtain $H_0 = 73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by breaking the mass-sheet transform using lens galaxy's mass models and stellar kinematics, respectively. Allowing $\Omega_K$ to vary increases the central value of $H_0$ and reduces its precision. We find that GW dark sirens have significant potential for calibrating SGL systems, due to their relatively higher redshifts. By combining 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain an $H_0$ constraint with a precision approximately $40\%$ better than the measurement from GW170817 using the Hubble law. This suggests that high-precision, model-independent $H_0$ measurements can be achieved with this method as the redshift range of GW dark sirens expands, even without the need for GW bright sirens.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology Without Singularities: A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is dedicated to a discussion regarding the role of Barrow's ''Zero Universes'' in quantum cosmology. In particular, we demonstrate that if quantum gravity effects are modeled by the quantum potential method associated with the ''many interacting universes'' (MIU) model, then the mere presence of the universes with a zero scale factor (the ``Zero universes'') produces a veritably remarkable outcome: the classical cosmological singularities of Big Bang, Big Crunch and Big Rip all fail to arise. In other words, those universes that are considered ill-posed at the classical level may turn out to be a necessary and sought-after ingredient in a future internally consistent quantum theory of gravity. Finally, we argue that the MIU quantization method might shed light on a number of other cosmological mysteries; for example, it might account for a decoherence which preceded the eternal inflation, and elucidate how the quantum superposition of vacuum decays occurring at different places might give birth to actual bubble universes there. In addition, the new method might help explain why our universe was born in an extremely low-entropy initial state required to trigger the initial inflation.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole sourced by a generalized string fluid in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with a generalized string fluid background. Our analysis reveals that zero-tidal solutions meet all geometric criteria for traversability while avoiding singularities, with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ modulating the throat geometry and asymptotic behavior. Varying the parameters $\alpha$ and $\varepsilon$ significantly affects curvature both near the throat and at large distances, maintaining finite values throughout spacetime. We demonstrate that the null energy condition (NEC) can be satisfied for high values of $\alpha$ ($\gtrsim 1$) and low string fluid density $\varepsilon$ ($\lesssim 0.1$), greatly reducing the exotic matter requirement compared to general relativistic wormholes. The string fluid's behavior approaches that of a cloud of strings for large $\alpha$ or $\varepsilon$. Additionally, the volume integral quantifier and complexity factor analyses show that increasing $\alpha$ reduces gravitational complexity and exotic matter content near the throat, aligning with NEC preservation. Our results establish that the combined influence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity and string-like matter can support traversable wormholes while minimizing unphysical energy conditions, offering new insights for constructing viable wormhole geometries in modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>
