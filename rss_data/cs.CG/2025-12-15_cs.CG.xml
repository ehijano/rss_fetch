      <title>Shortest Paths on Convex Polyhedral Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the surface of a convex polyhedron with $n$ vertices. We consider the two-point shortest path query problem for $\mathcal{P}$: Constructing a data structure so that given any two query points $s$ and $t$ on $\mathcal{P}$, a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ on $\mathcal{P}$ can be computed efficiently. To achieve $O(\log n)$ query time (for computing the shortest path length), the previously best result uses $O(n^{8+\epsilon})$ preprocessing time and space [Aggarwal, Aronov, O'Rourke, and Schevon, SICOMP 1997], where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant. In this paper, we present a new data structure of $O(n^{6+\epsilon})$ preprocessing time and space, with $O(\log n)$ query time. For a special case where one query point is required to lie on one of the edges of $\mathcal{P}$, the previously best work uses $O(n^{6+\epsilon})$ preprocessing time and space to achieve $O(\log n)$ query time. We improve the preprocessing time and space to $O(n^{5+\epsilon})$, with $O(\log n)$ query time. Furthermore, we present a new algorithm to compute the exact set of shortest path edge sequences of $\mathcal{P}$, which are known to be $\Theta(n^4)$ in number and have a total complexity of $\Theta(n^5)$ in the worst case. The previously best algorithm for the problem takes roughly $O(n^6\log n\log^*n)$ time, while our new algorithm runs in $O(n^{5+\epsilon})$ time.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of One or Many Faces in the Overlay of Many Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Combination Lemma of [GSS89] that expresses the complexity of one or several faces in the overlay of many arrangements, as a function of the number of arrangements, the number of faces, and the complexities of these faces in the separate arrangements. Several applications of the new Combination Lemma are presented: We first show that the complexity of a single face in an arrangement of $k$ simple polygons with a total of $n$ sides is $\Theta(n \alpha(k) )$, where $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the inverse of Ackermann's function. We also give a new and simpler proof of the bound $O \left( \sqrt{m} \lambda_{s+2}( n ) \right)$ on the total number of edges of $m$ faces in an arrangement of $n$ Jordan arcs, each pair of which intersect in at most $s$ points, where $\lambda_{s}(n)$ is the maximum length of a Davenport-Schinzel sequence of order $s$ with $n$ symbols. We extend this result, showing that the total number of edges of $m$ faces in a sparse arrangement of $n$ Jordan arcs is $O \left( (n + \sqrt{m}\sqrt{w}) \frac{\lambda_{s+2}(n)}{n} \right)$, where $w$ is the total complexity of the arrangement. Several other applications and variants of the Combination Lemma are also presented.</description>

      <title>Tiling with Boundaries: Dense digital images have large connected components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If most of the pixels in an $n \times m$ digital image are the same color, must the image contain a large connected component? How densely can a given set of connected components pack in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ without touching? We answer these two closely related questions for both 4-connected and 8-connected components. In particular, we use structural arguments to upper bound the "white" pixel density of infinite images whose white (4- or 8-)connected components have size at most $k$. Explicit tilings show that these bounds are tight for at least half of all natural numbers $k$ in the 4-connected case, and for all $k$ in the 8-connected case. We also extend these results to finite images.
  To obtain the upper bounds, we define the exterior site perimeter of a connected component and then leverage geometric and topological properties of this set to partition images into nontrivial regions called polygonal tiles. Each polygonal tile contains a single white connected component and satisfies a certain maximality property. We then use isoperimetric inequalities to precisely bound the area of these tiles. The solutions to these problems represent new statistics on the connected component distribution of digital images.</description>

      <title>Tileable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $C^1$-regular surfaces in $R^3$ that admit tilings by a finite number of rigid motion congruence classes of tiles. We construct examples with various topologies and present a framework for a systematic study, mainly concentrating on monotilings. A finite edge prototile is a tile that has only a finite number of possible interfaces with adjacent copies of itself. We describe all monotilings by such tiles with three or less edges. We consider the question of whether a monohedral polyhedron can be smoothed to become a finite edge type tileable surface with the same graph structure, and we give an example where this is not possible. Finally we list some open problems.</description>
