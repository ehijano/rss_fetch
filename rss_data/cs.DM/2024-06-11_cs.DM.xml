      <title>Maximal Line Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A line digraph $L(G) = (A, E)$ is the digraph constructed from the digraph $G = (V, A)$ such that there is an arc $(a,b)$ in $L(G)$ if the terminal node of $a$ in $G$ is the initial node of $b$. The maximum number of arcs in a line digraph with $m$ nodes is $(m/2)^2 + (m/2)$ if $m$ is even, and $((m - 1)/2)^2 + m - 1$ otherwise. For $m \geq 7$, there is only one line digraph with as many arcs if $m$ is even, and if $m$ is odd, there are two line digraphs, each being the transpose of the other.</description>

      <title>Convergence Properties of Dynamic Processes on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical computer science plays an important role in the understanding of social networks and their properties. We can model information rippling throughout social networks, or the opinions of social media users for example, using graph theory and Markov chains. In this thesis, we model social networks as graphs, and consider two such processes:
  1. Nodes talk to other nodes and find middle ground, causing their opinions to come closer to consensus (the load balancing model)
  2. All nodes take the maximum value of their neighbours in lockstep (the synchronous maximum model)
  We study the convergence behaviours of each process, such as the eventual state of the graph, the convergence time and the period. We provide proofs of the eventual states and periods for each of the above models, and theoretical bounds for the worst case convergence times. We verify these with experiments, and explore further questions such as the average case convergence time of various special classes of graphs, or the convergence times when the model is altered slightly.</description>

      <title>A characterization of uniquely representable two-directional orthogonal ray graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a characterization of uniquely representable two-directional orthogonal ray graphs, which are defined as the intersection graphs of rightward and downward rays. The collection of these rays is called a representation of the graph. Two-directional orthogonal ray graphs are equivalent to several well-studied classes of graphs, including complements of circular-arc graphs with clique cover number two. Normalized representations of two-directional orthogonal ray graphs, where the positions of certain rays are determined by neighborhood containment relations, can be obtained from the normalized representations of circular-arc graphs. However, the normalized representations are not necessarily unique, even when considering only the relative positions of the rays. Recent studies indicate that two-directional orthogonal ray graphs share similar characterizations to interval graphs. Hanlon (1982) and Fishburn (1985) characterized uniquely representable interval graphs by introducing the notion of a buried subgraph. Following their characterization, we define buried subgraphs of two-directional orthogonal ray graphs and prove that their absence is a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to be uniquely representable.</description>

      <title>Repetition Threshold for Binary Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical exponent of an infinite word $\bf x$ is the supremum, over all finite nonempty factors $f$, of the exponent of $f$. In this note we show that for all integers $k\geq 2,$ there is a binary infinite $k$-automatic sequence with critical exponent $\leq 7/3$. The same conclusion holds for Fibonacci-automatic and Tribonacci-automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>Almost optimum $\ell$-covering of $\mathbb{Z}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $B$ of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is referred to as a $\ell$-covering set if $\{ ab \pmod n | 0\leq a \leq \ell, b\in B\} = \mathbb{Z}_n$. We show that there exists a $\ell$-covering set of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ of size $O(\frac{n}{\ell}\log n)$ for all $n$ and $\ell$, and how to construct such a set. We also provide examples where any $\ell$-covering set must have a size of $\Omega(\frac{n}{\ell}\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. The proof employs a refined bound for the relative totient function obtained through sieve theory and the existence of a large divisor with a linear divisor sum. The result can be used to simplify a modular subset sum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>
