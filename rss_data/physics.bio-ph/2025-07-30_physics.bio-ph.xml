      <title>Active Liquid Crystal Theory Explains the Collective Organization of Microtubules in Human Mitotic Spindles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How thousands of microtubules and molecular motors self-organize into spindles remains poorly understood. By combining static, nanometer-resolution, large-scale electron tomography reconstructions and dynamic, optical-resolution, polarized light microscopy, we test an active liquid crystal continuum model of mitotic spindles in human tissue culture cells. The predictions of this coarse-grained theory quantitatively agree with the experimentally measured spindle morphology and fluctuation spectra. These findings argue that local interactions and polymerization produce collective alignment, diffusive-like motion, and polar transport which govern the behaviors of the spindle's microtubule network, and provide a means to measure the spindle's material properties. This work demonstrates that a coarse-grained theory featuring measurable, physically-interpretable parameters can quantitatively describe the mechanical behavior and self-organization of human mitotic spindles.</description>

      <title>Biomimetic Engineering of a Fortified Ice Composite with Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents BioPykrete, a new sustainable bio-composite material created from ice, nano-crystalline cellulose (CNC), and a tailor-made chimera protein designed to bind the two together. We developed and produced the chimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a CNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead, it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.</description>

      <title>Self-organized biodiversity and species abundance distribution patterns in ecosystems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the emergence of self-organized biodiversity and species abundance distribution patterns remians a fundamental challenge in ecology. While classical frameworks, such as neutral theory and models based on pairwise species interactions, have provided valuable insights, they often neglect higher-order interactions (HOIs), whose role in stabilizing ecological communities is increasingly recognized. Here, we extend the Generalized Lotka-Volterra framework to incorporate HOIs and demonstrate that these interactions can enhance ecosystem stability and prevent collapse. Our model exhibits a diverse range of emergent dynamics, including self-sustained oscillations, quasi-periodic (torus) trajectories, and intermittent chaos. Remarkably, it also reproduces empirical species abundance distributions observed across diverse natural communities. These results underscore the critical role of HOIs in structuring biodiversity and offer a broadly applicable theoretical framework for capturing complexity in ecological systems</description>

      <title>Active spin model for cell assemblies on 1D substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental use of micropatterned quasi-1D substrates has emerged as an useful experimental tool to study the nature of cell-cell interactions and gain insight on collective behaviour of cell colonies. Inspired by these experiments, we propose an active spin model to investigate the emergent properties of the cell assemblies. The lattice gas model incorporates the interplay of self-propulsion, polarity directional switching, intra-cellular attraction, and contact Inhibition Locomotion (CIL). In the absence of vacancies, which corresponds to a confluent cell packing on the substrate, the model reduces to an equilibrium spin model which can be solved exactly. In the presence of vacancies, the clustering is controlled by a dimensionless Peclet Number, Q - the ratio of magnitude of self-propulsion rate and directional switching rate of particles. In the absence of CIL interactions, we invoke a mapping to Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn(KLS) model to determine an exact analytical form of the cluster size distribution in the limit Q &lt;&lt; 1. In the limit of Q &gt;&gt; 1, the cluster size distribution exhibits an universal scaling behaviour (in an approximate sense), such that the distribution function can be expressed as a scaled function of Q, particle density and CIL interaction strength. We characterize the phase behaviour of the system in terms of contour plots of average cluster size. The average cluster size exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on CIL interaction strength, attractive interaction strength, and self-propulsion.</description>

      <title>Simple low-dimensional computations explain variability in neuronal activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of neural computation is founded on the assumption that neurons fire in response to a linear summation of inputs. Yet experiments demonstrate that some neurons are capable of complex computations that require interactions between inputs. Here we show, across multiple brain regions and species, that simple computations (without interactions between inputs) explain most of the variability in neuronal activity. Neurons are quantitatively described by models that capture the measured dependence on each input individually, but assume nothing about combinations of inputs. These minimal models, which are equivalent to binary artificial neurons, predict complex higher-order dependencies and recover known features of synaptic connectivity. The inferred computations are low-dimensional, indicating a highly redundant neural code that is necessary for error correction. These results suggest that, despite intricate biophysical details, most neurons perform simple computations typically reserved for artificial models.</description>

      <title>Inferring biological processes with intrinsic noise from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring dynamical models from data continues to be a significant challenge in computational biology, especially given the stochastic nature of many biological processes. We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ODE inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
