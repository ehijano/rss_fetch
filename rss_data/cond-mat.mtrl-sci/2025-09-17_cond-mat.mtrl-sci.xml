      <title>Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Light Interstitial Segregation Energies in Ni: The Role of Local Cr Coordination for Boron and Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interstitial segregation in chemically complex alloys requires accounting for chemical and structural heterogeneity of interfaces, motivating approaches that move beyond scalar descriptors to capture the full spatial and compositional spectra of segregation behavior. Here, we introduce a spectral segregation framework that maps distributions of segregation energies for light interstitials in Ni as a function of local Cr coordination. Boron exhibits a broad, rugged energy spectrum with significant positional flexibility whereas carbon remains confined to a narrow spectrum with minimal displacement. At the free surface, Cr-rich coordination destabilizes both interstitials (e.g., positive segregation energies), in sharp contrast to the stabilizing role of Cr at the GB. This inversion establishes a natural segregation gradient that drives interstitials away from undercoordinated internal surfaces and toward GBs. These results underscore the limitations of single-valued segregation descriptors and demonstrate how a distributional approach reveals the mechanistic origins of interstitial--interface interactions in chemically heterogeneous alloys.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Photon-Correlations Reveal Triexciton Features in Single Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are established quantum emitters with potential for entangled photon-pair generation via multiexciton cascades. However, the energetics and dynamics of many-body excitations remain poorly understood. Here, we perform time- and frequency-resolved photon-correlation spectroscopy of single CsPbBr\textsubscript{3} PQDs at low temperatures using a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. We report biexciton binding energies and assign their charged states, which undergo fast ($\mu$s) switching dynamics. Most notably, we identify a spectral feature blue-shifted from the exciton by $7.4 \pm 1.9$ meV as the bound triexciton and establish the order of its cascade emission. These results highlight the power of low-temperature, multidimensional photon-correlation spectroscopy for resolving complex many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Coupled Infrared Imaging and Multiphysics Modeling to Predict Three-Dimensional Thermal Characteristics during Selective Laser Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser heating during additive manufacturing (AM) induces extreme and transient thermal conditions which critically influence the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the resulting component. However, accurately resolving these conditions with sufficient spatiotemporal accuracy remains a central challenge. We demonstrate a unique approach that couples high-speed infrared imaging, during selective laser melting of MAR-M247, with a transient three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics simulation to reconstruct the dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool. This integrated framework enables the estimation of experimentally-validated, 3D solidification conditions-including solidification velocities and cooling rates-at the solid-liquid interface while also significantly lowering computational cost. By quantifying solidification conditions, we predict variations in microstructure size and orientation driven by laser processing parameters and validate them with ex situ scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction maps. Our findings substantiate that an integrated experimental-computational approach is crucial to realize in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in commercial AM.</description>

      <title>High-pressure electronic states in semiconductors studied by infrared spectroscopy: metallization and band gap tuning in Mg$_2$Si, InAs and InSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a brief introduction is first given on infrared studies of materials at high pressures using a diamond anvil cell. Then, our recent results of high-pressure infrared studies are described for Mg$_2$Si, InAs, and InSb. For Mg$_2$Si, pressure-induced metallization at pressures near 10 GPa were clearly demonstrated for both carrier-doped and undoped Mg$_2$Si by large increases of reflectivity. For InAs and InSb, their band gap ($E_g$) increased rapidly and almost linearly with pressure with linear coefficients of $dE_g/dP$=84.6 and 112 meV/GPa, respectively. Obtained values of $E_g$ versus lattice parameter at high pressures are compared with those for other IIl-V semiconductors at ambient pressure, giving unique insight into effects of physical and chemical pressures on $E_g$. Above the structural transition pressures of 7 and 3 GPa for InAs and InSb, respectively, they exhibit highly metallic characteristics accompanied by high reflectivity.</description>

      <title>Over One Order of Magnitude Enhancement in Hole Mobility of 2D III-V Semiconductors through Valence Band Edge Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors show great potential to sustain Moore's law in the era of ultra-scaled electronics. However, their scalable applications are severely constrained by low hole mobility. In this work, we take 2D-GaAs as a prototype of III-V semiconductors to investigate the effects of quantum anharmonicity (QA) on hole transport, employing the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by the machine learning potential. It is found that the room-temperature hole mobility of 2D-GaAs is reduced by $\sim$44% as the QA effects are incorporated, which is attributed to the enhanced electron-phonon scattering from the out-of-plane acoustic polarization. The valence band edge shift (VBES) strategy is proposed to increase the hole mobility by $\sim$1600% at room temperature, which can be realized by 1% biaxial compressive strain. The electron-phonon scattering rate is dramatically decreased due to the full filtering of the original interband electron-phonon scattering channels that existed in the flat hole pocket. The VBES strategy can be further extended to other 2D III-V semiconductors to promote their hole mobilities.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale phase-field modeling with universal machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale phase-field modeling formulates the probability densities of atomic vibrations as Gaussian distributions and derives a free energy functional using variational Gaussian theory and interatomic potentials. This framework permits per-Gaussian decomposition of the free energy, providing a description of local thermodynamic states with atomic resolution. However, existing formulations are limited to classical pairwise interatomic potentials, restricting their applicability to specific materials and compromising quantitative accuracy. In this work, we extend the atomic-scale phase-field methodology by incorporating universal machine learning interatomic potentials, thereby generalizing the free energy functional to many-body systems. This extension enhances both the accuracy and transferability of the approach. We demonstrate the method by applying it to bulk copper under NVT and NPT ensembles, where the predicted pressures and equilibrium lattice constants show excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, validating the theoretical framework. Furthermore, we apply the method to {\Sigma}5(310)[001] grain boundaries in copper, enabling the visualization of local free energy distributions with atomic-scale resolution. The results reveal a pronounced free energy concentration at the grain boundary core, capturing the thermodynamic signature of the interface. This study establishes a versatile and accurate framework for atomic-scale thermodynamic modeling, significantly broadening the scope of phase-field approaches to include complex materials and defect structures.</description>

      <title>Beyond conventional half-metals: gapless states and spin gapless semiconducting behavior in X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) Heusler compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for high-performance spintronic materials motivates the exploration of Heusler alloys with unconventional electronic properties. Using density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$~eV), we investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states, which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the recent advancements in atomically thin two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) and their potential applications in various fields, including nanoelectronics, photonics, sensing, energy storage, and optoelectronics. Specifically, the focus is on TMDs such as MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2, promising for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics devices based on ultra-thin atomic layers. One of the main challenges in utilising TMDs for practical applications is the scalable production of defect-free materials on desired substrates. However, innovative growth strategies have been developed to address this issue and meet the growing demand for high-quality and controllable TMD materials. These strategies are compatible with conventional and unconventional substrates, opening up new possibilities for practical implementation. Furthermore, the article highlights the development of novel 2D TMDs with unique functionalities and remarkable chemistry. These advancements contribute to expanding the range of applications and capabilities of TMD materials, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with these ultra-thin layers. In addition to electronics, the article delves into the significant efforts dedicated to exploring the potential of 2D TMDs in energy and sensor applications. These materials have shown promising characteristics for energy storage and have been extensively studied for their sensing capabilities, showcasing their versatility and potential impact in these fields. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in 2D TMDs, emphasising their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing. The continuous research and development in this area is promising for advancing these materials and their integration into practical devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Structural and Electrocatalytic Properties of La-Co-Ni Oxide Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La-Co-Ni oxides were fabricated in the form of thin-film materials libraries by combinatorial reactive co-sputtering and analyzed for structural and functional properties over large compositional ranges: normalized to the metals of the film they span about 0 - 70 at.-% for Co, 18 - 81 at.-% for La and 11 - 25 at.-% for Ni. Composition-dependent phase analysis shows formation of three areas with different phase constitutions in dependance of Co-content: In the La-rich region with low Co content, a mixture of the phases La2O3, perovskite, and La(OH)3 is observed. In the Co-rich region, perovskite and spinel phases form. Between the three-phase region and the Co-rich two-phase region, a single-phase perovskite region emerges. Surface microstructure analysis shows formation of additional crystallites on the surface in the two-phase area, which become more numerous with increasing Ni-content. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis indicates that these crystallites mainly contain Co and Ni, so they could be spinels growing on the surface. The analysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity over all compositions and phase constitutions reveals that the perovskite/spinel two-phase region shows the highest catalytic activity, which increases with higher Ni-content. The highest OER current density was measured as 2.24 mA/cm2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE for the composition La11Co20Ni9O60.</description>

      <title>Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations.</description>

      <title>Structural effects of boron doping in diamond crystals for gamma-ray light-source applications: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.</description>

      <title>Explaining Principles of Tip-Enhanced Raman Images with Ab Initio Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a powerful method for imaging vibrational motion and chemically characterizing surface-bound systems. Theoretical simulations of TERS images often consider systems in isolation, ignoring any substrate support, such as metallic surfaces. Here, we show that this omission leads to deviations from experimentally measured data through simulations with a new finite-field formulation of first-principles simulation of TERS spectra that can address extended, periodic systems. We show that TERS images of tetracyanoethylene on Ag(100) and defective MoS$_2$ monolayers calculated using isolated molecules or cluster models are qualitatively different from those calculated when accounting for the periodicity of the substrate. For Mg(II)-porphine on Ag(100), a system for which a direct experimental comparison is possible, these simulations prove to be crucial for explaining the spatial variation of TERS intensity patterns and allow us to uncover fundamental principles of TERS spectroscopy. We explain how and why surface interactions affect images of out-of-plane vibrational modes much more than those of in-plane modes, providing an important tool for the future interpretation of these images in more complex systems.</description>

Prevailing treatments, however, typically rely on large-scale density functional theory (DFT), which is computationally costly and mechanistically opaque. Here, we develop a unified analytical framework to overcome these limitations. From continuum elastic theory, we derive closed-form solutions for both in-plane and out-of-plane relaxation fields. We further introduce an analytical phase factor expansion theory that maps relaxation into the electronic Hamiltonian. By applying this framework, the relaxation-mediated single-particle and many-body topological phase transitions in twisted MoTe$_{2}$ is accurately captured, and the evolution of flat bands in magic-angle graphene is quantitatively reproduced. Our work transforms the research of moir\'e relaxation from black-box numerical fitting to an analytical paradigm, offering fundamental insights, exceptional efficiency, and general applicability to a wide range of twisted materials.</description>

      <title>Understanding oxide surface stability: Theoretical insights from silver chromate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver chromate ($\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$) has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its promising photocatalytic performance, which strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of its exposed surfaces. A detailed understanding of the structural stability of these surfaces under realistic conditions is therefore essential for advancing its applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) with first-principles atomistic thermodynamics to systematically investigate the stability of multiple surface orientations and terminations of $\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$. The surface Gibbs free energy was evaluated as a function of oxygen and silver chemical potentials, enabling the construction of stability trends under non-vacuum environments. Our results reveal that the degree of coordination of surface chromium-oxygen clusters plays a decisive role in determining surface stability. Furthermore, Wulff constructions predict morphology evolution as a function of external conditions, allowing us to identify the atomic structures of the exposed facets in the equilibrium crystal shape. These insights provide a fundamental framework for understanding surface-dependent photocatalytic activity in $\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$ and related silver-based oxides.</description>

      <title>Strain-tuned magnetoelectric properties of monolayer NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br): a first-principles analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using \textit{ab initio} methodology, we reveal a strain-mediated approach to precisely tune the magnetoelectric coupling and spin-driven emergent polarization of NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br) monolayers. In the absence of strain, these systems spontaneously stabilize non-collinear spin states that break the inversion symmetry, inducing a ferroelectric polarization in the plane of the material. We show that biaxial and uniaxial strains broadly modulate the magnetoelectric response in these materials through two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct modification of the magnetoelectric tensor components, and (ii) tuning of the characteristic propagation vectors of a spin texture. This dual mechanism enables precise control over the magnitude of the spin-induced electric polarization of these materials. With respect to the achievable magnitude of the electric polarization, we demonstrate the critical role of third-nearest-neighbor spin-pair contributions, which can increase under strain to levels that compete with or even exceed the polarization driven by first-nearest-neighbor effects. These findings offer important insights into low-dimensional piezo-magnetoelectricity and expand the possibilities for designing multifunctional two-dimensional straintronic devices.</description>

      <title>High-throughput screening of spin Hall conductivity in 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with large spin Hall effect (SHE) have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in next-generation spintronic devices. In this work, we perform high-throughput (HTP) calculations to obtain the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of 4486 non-magnetic compounds in the \texttt{2Dmatpedia} database and identify six materials with SHC exceeding $500\,(\hbar/e)\,(\mathrm{S/cm})$, surpassing those of previously known materials. Detailed analysis reveals that the significant SHC can be attributed to spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced gap openings at Dirac-like band crossings. Additionally, the presence of mirror symmetry further enhances the SHC. Beyond the high-SHC materials, 57 topological insulators with quantized SHCs have also been identified. Our work enables rapid screening and paves the way for experimental validation, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel 2D materials optimized for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Effective conduction-band model for zincblende III-V semiconductors in the presence of strain: tuning the properties of bulk crystals and nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain provides a powerful knob to tailor the electronic properties of semiconductors. Simple yet accurate approximations that capture strain effects in demanding simulations of mesoscopic nanostructures are therefore highly desirable. However, for III-V compounds, key materials for quantum applications, such approaches remain comparatively underdeveloped. In this work, we derive a compact, effective Hamiltonian that describes the conduction band of zincblende III-V semiconductors incorporating strain effects. Starting from the eight-band k$\cdot$p model with Bir-Pikus corrections, we perform a folding-down procedure to obtain analytical expressions for conduction-band strain-renormalized parameters, including the effective mass, chemical potential, spin-orbit coupling, and $g$-factor. The model reproduces full multiband results under small to moderate strain, while retaining a form suitable for device-scale calculations. We benchmark the model for bulk deformations and apply it to representative nanostructures, such as core.shell nanowires and planar heterostructures. Our results provide a practical and versatile tool for incorporating strain into the design of III-V semiconductor devices, enabling reliable predictions of their properties with direct implications for spintronic, straintronic, optoelectronic, and topological quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Atomic Data Mining via Multi-Kernel Graph Autoencoders for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface. Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation cryogenic transmission electron microscopes (TEM) aim to achieve high-resolution imaging at ultracold sample temperatures (&lt; 90 K) and over extended hold times. Lower temperatures enable atomic-scale characterization with improved beam and dose resilience for organic specimens and access to emergent electronic phases in quantum materials. Side-entry liquid helium cooling stages presently lack the mechanical and thermal stability required to support sub-Angstrom information transfer in modern TEM. Here we demonstrate sub-Angstrom atomic imaging TEM with a side-entry stage at specimen temperatures down to ~20K and with low stage drift and stable hold times.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) to Simulate Large Atomistic Systems for Fidelity Improvement of Superconducting Qubits and Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.</description>

      <title>Morphological and Chemical Changes in Cd-free Colloidal QD-LEDs During Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) have demonstrated remarkable brightness, saturated color, and high efficiencies across a broad spectral range. However, in contrast to organic LEDs (OLEDs), QD-LED operational lifetimes remain limited, with the underlying degradation mechanisms not fully understood. In the present study, we show that InP/ZnSe/ZnS (red-emitting) and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS (blue-emitting) cadmium-free colloidal QD-LEDs undergo nanoscale morphological changes during operation. Specifically,interparticle coarsening and layer thinning are observed in the electron transport layer (ETL) consisting of ZnMgO nanoparticles (NPs), in the QD emissive layer, and in the organic hole transport layer. This is accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals throughout the device, with oxygen accumulating at the electrode/ETL interfance. Moreover, in situ transmission electron microscopy reveals the electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO NPs coarsening. To mitigate these degradation pathway, we show that acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilize the ETL/QD layers by suppressing the radical formation and halting morphology changes. This approach achieves dramatic stability enhancements, exhibits an 8-fold and 5000-fold lifetime improvement on InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs, respectively. Our findings establish the causal relationships between the morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and state-of-the-art QD-LEDs instability, providing new insights into a scalable encapsulation treatment that enables efficient and long-lived Cd-free QD-LEDs.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements have led to the development of bright and heavy metal-free blue-emitting quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). However, consensus understanding of their distinct photophysical and electroluminescent dynamics remains elusive. This work correlates the chemical and electronic changes occurring in a QLED during operation using depth-resolved and operando techniques. The results indicate that oxygen vacancy forms in the ZnMgO layer during operation, with important implications on the charge injection and electrochemical dynamics. Taken together, the results suggest a causal relationship between oxygen vacancy formation and operational degradation of the blue-emitting ZnSeTe-based QLEDs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Local Point-Group-Symmetry Order in Complex Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Electro-viscoelasticity of polymer melts in continuum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-viscoelastic theory for polymer melts has been extensively studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes. However, the modeling and theory for this have been minimal, leaving many questions on the mechanisms and behavior of an arbitrary flow scheme. To remedy this, previously solved overdamped Langevin equations for the Doi-Rouse model are modified to include charge and electric field potential forces. The charge sequence on the chain is hypothesized to be a cosine sequence along the chain, resembling multiple electric dipoles that conveniently correspond to a Rouse mode of the chain. These are then solved for the shear stress under homogeneous shear rates and electric fields to find directional viscosity increases depending on the shearing and electric field orientation. Using the newly derived shear stress from the Doi-Rouse approach, a continuum model is proposed that resembles a modified upper-convected Maxwell model, including polarization stresses in terms of an electric field dyadic. This new continuum model, named the upper-convected electro-Maxwell model, is verified using Kremer-Grest polymer chains simulated with molecular dynamics for multiple flow schemes and a specified charge sequence along the chain. Furthermore, the MD results verified the difference in the overall and charge sequence relaxation times through the shear and normal stress polarizations, showing the necessity for the upper-convected derivative of the electric field dyadic to correct the viscosity scaling. Finally, the dynamic properties of the polarized polymer melt are examined analytically, finding that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field contribution.</description>

      <title>Mixed Triplet-Singlet Order Parameter in Decoupled Superconducting 1H Monolayers of Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of unconventional superconductivity, where the order parameter deviates from simple isotropic s-wave pairing, is a central puzzle in condensed matter physics. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal.</description>

      <title>Dual Role for Heterogeneity in Dynamic Fracture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We approach the problem of heterogeneous dynamic fracture by considering spatiotemporal perturbations to planar crack fronts. Front propagation is governed by local energy balance between the elastic energy per unit area available to fracture, G, and the dissipation in creating new surfaces. G is known analytically as a perturbation series in the crack front fluctuation. For dissipation that monotonically increases with the crack speed, we derive an equation of motion for crack fronts that is second-order accurate. In the linear order, heterogeneity does not change the net speed of fracture. In the second order, nonlinear interactions of the front and the heterogeneous landscape populate an intermediate-scale fluctuation spectrum. We find that, when dissipation weakly grows with velocity, nonlinearities globally amplify dissipation and reduce the crack speed. Strong velocity dependence, however, mitigates toughening effects and may facilitate fracture.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals materials enable the construction of atomically sharp interfaces between compounds with distinct crystal and electronic properties. This is dramatically exploited in moir\'e systems, where a lattice mismatch or twist between monolayers generates an emergent in-plane periodicity, giving rise to electronic properties absent in the constituent materials. In contrast, vertical superlattices, formed by stacking dissimilar materials in the out-of-plane direction on the nanometer scale, have received far less attention despite their potential to realize analogous emergent phenomena in three dimensions. Through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory, we investigate six-to-eight-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures constructed from pairs of stacked few-layer materials. Counterintuitively, we find that even these single superlattice units can host fully-delocalised bands, evidencing a robust coherent interlayer coupling across lattice-mismatched interfaces over extended spatial scales. We show how uncompensated semimetallic phases and energetically-mismatched topological surface states are readily and exclusively stabilized within such asymmetrical architectures. These findings establish two-component heterostructures in the intermediate layer-regime as platforms to invoke and control unprecedented combinations and instances of the diverse quantum phases native to many-layer TMDs.</description>

Abstract: Coherence time is a key property of quantum systems, determining how long quantum information can be preserved. In solid-state platforms, this parameter is closely linked to the lifetime of quasiparticles that can store quantum information. For decades, magnons - quasiparticles arising from collective magnetization dynamics - have exhibited lifetimes below one microsecond at gigahertz frequencies, limiting their viability as quantum information carriers. Here, we report the discovery of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment was performed on an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) sphere over a wide temperature range, from ambient down to 30 mK. These results directly confirm the theoretical prediction that the magnon lifetime in an ideal YIG crystal at zero temperature is infinite, paving the way for the engineering of lossless magnetic systems in which magnons will be employed as long-lived carriers of information for quantum gates and quantum storage.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale FEM Model of Concrete: Statistical Assessment of Inherent Stress Concentrations in Dependence on Phase Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concrete heterogeneity originates from its production process, which involves bonding aggregates with a binder matrix. This study presents a mesoscale finite element model (MFEM) that offers detailed insights into the fracture process at the aggregate--cement matrix interface, focusing on one of concrete's key properties: its mechanical response. Unlike discrete models, which often average out critical stress concentrations within the mesostructure, the MFEM approach captures detailed stress distributions, revealing localized effects crucial for understanding damage evolution.
  Although computationally more demanding, the MFEM leverages modern high-performance computing (HPC) to provide a detailed description of the stress field and material damage across different phases and interfaces. The proposed modeling framework integrates a collision-checked aggregate generation procedure, Voronoi-based mesostructure construction, and adaptive 3D meshing, forming a reusable methodology for stress analysis in heterogeneous composites. This approach offers transparent, physically interpretable parameterization of phase properties in contrast to black-box discrete models.
  Another methodological contribution is the statistical post-processing of stress data using histogram-based analysis across cross-sectional planes. This enables quantitative evaluation of stress concentration distributions, providing valuable insights into the mesoscale mechanical response and serving as a useful visualization tool for researchers working on heterogeneous material modeling. Various matrix-to-aggregate stiffness ratios are considered to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on the stress field.</description>

      <title>Incipient ionic conductors: Ion-constrained lattices achieving superionic-like thermal conductivity by extreme anharmonicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon liquid-like thermal conduction in the solid state enables superionic conductors to serve as efficient thermoelectric device candidates. While liquid-like motion of ions effectively suppresses thermal conductivity (\kappa), their high mobility concurrently triggers material degradation due to undesirable ion migration and consequent metal deposition, making it still a challenge to balancing low \kappa and high stability. Here, we report a superionic-like thermal transport alongside restricted long-range ion migration in CsCu_2I_3 with incipient ionic conduction, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, inelastic X-ray scattering, and machine-learning potential-based simulations. We reveal that the Cu ions exhibit confined migration between CuI_4 tetrahedra at high temperatures, displaying extreme anharmonicity of dominated phonons beyond conventional rattling and comparable to that in superionic conductorsl. Consequently, a glass-like \kappa (~0.3 W m^{-1} K^{-1} at 300 K) following the relationship of \kappa ~ T^{0.17}, was achieved along the x-direction, where Cu ion migration is three oders of magnitude lower than in superionic conductors. These results highlight the advantage of incipient ionic conductors in simultaneously maintaining both low \kappa and high stability, elucidate the thermal transport mechanism via ion migration constraints, and pave an effective pathway toward ultralow thermal conductivity in ionic conductors.</description>

      <title>Electro-thermal Co-design of Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity BaTiO3 Field-plate for High-field and Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have received considerable attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in several fields, including electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and sensing. Following the experimental realization of graphene, numerous other 2D carbon structures have been proposed and, in some cases, successfully synthesized. This work presents a concise review of the recently experimentally realized 2D carbon allotropes, including graphynes, biphenylene-based networks, fullerene networks, and monolayer amorphous carbon. For each class, we discuss structural characteristics, theoretical predictions, and synthesis methods, with emphasis on the interplay between theory and experiment. We also highlight instances where experimental studies overlooked relevant theoretical contributions. Finally, we identify theoretically predicted structures that remain unexplored experimentally, suggesting opportunities for synthesis-driven investigations.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of planar crack fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for predicting fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. However, large and localized disturbances to crack motion induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are essential determinants of chemical system behaviour across diverse environments. We present a foundation framework that integrates explicit polarizable long-range physics with an equivariant graph neural network potential. It employs a physically motivated polarizable charge equilibration scheme that directly optimizes electrostatic interaction energies rather than partial charges. The foundation model, trained across the periodic table up to Pu, demonstrates strong performance across key materials modelling challenges. It effectively captures long-range interactions that are challenging for traditional message-passing mechanisms and accurately reproduces polarization effects under external electric fields. We have applied the model to mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes, ferroelectric phase transitions, and reactive dynamics at electrode-electrolyte interfaces, highlighting the model's capacity to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show that as a foundation model, it can be efficiently finetuned to achieve high-level accuracy for specific challenging systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport and Molecular Sensing in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured with Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and electrical measurements to investigate local electronic transport in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that quantum transport in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied with a conducting atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Scanning gate microscopy (SGM) reveals a clear p-type response in which local gating modulates the source-drain current, while scanning impedance microscopy (SIM) indicates corresponding shifts of the Fermi level under different gating conditions. The observed transport behavior arises from the combined effects of the AFM tip induced Fermi level shifts and defect mediated scattering. These results show that resonant scattering associated with impurities or structural defects plays a central role and highlight the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on rGO conduction. Consistent with this electrostatic control, the device also exhibits chemical gating and sensing: during exposure to electron-withdrawing molecules (acetone), the source-drain current increases reversibly and returns to baseline upon purging with air. Repeated cycles over 15 minutes show reproducible amplitudes and recovery. Using a simple transport model we estimate an increase of about 40 percent in carrier density during exposure, consistent with p-type doping by electron-accepting analytes. These findings link nanoscale electrostatic control to macroscopic sensing performance, advancing the understanding of charge transport in rGO and underscoring its promise for nanoscale electronics, flexible chemical sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced proximate quantum spin ice phase in Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$, lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.</description>
