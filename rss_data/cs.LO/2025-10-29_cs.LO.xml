      <title>Formal Verification of a Token Sale Launchpad: A Compositional Approach in Dafny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of decentralized financial (DeFi) systems and smart contracts has underscored the critical need for software correctness. Bugs in such systems can lead to catastrophic financial losses. Formal verification offers a path to achieving mathematical certainty about software behavior. This paper presents the formal verification of the core logic for a token sale launchpad, implemented and proven correct using the Dafny programming language and verification system. We detail a compositional, bottom-up verification strategy, beginning with the proof of fundamental non-linear integer arithmetic properties, and building upon them to verify complex business logic, including asset conversion, time-based discounts, and capped-sale refund mechanics. The principal contributions are the formal proofs of critical safety and lifecycle properties. Most notably, we prove that refunds in a capped sale can never exceed the user's original deposit amount, and that the precision loss in round-trip financial calculations is strictly bounded. Furthermore, we verify the complete lifecycle logic, including user withdrawals under various sale mechanics and the correctness of post-sale token allocation, vesting, and claiming. This work serves as a comprehensive case study in applying rigorous verification techniques to build high-assurance financial software.</description>

      <title>On syntactic concept lattice models for the Lambek calculus and infinitary action logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linguistic applications of the Lambek calculus suggest its semantics over algebras of formal languages. A straightforward approach to construct such semantics indeed yields a brilliant completeness theorem (Pentus 1995). However, extending the calculus with extra operations ruins completeness. In order to mitigate this issue, Wurm (2017) introduced a modification of this semantics, namely, models over syntactic concept lattices (SCLs). We extend this semantics to the infinitary extension of the Lambek calculus with Kleene iteration (infinitary action logic), prove strong completeness and some interesting corollaries. We also discuss issues arising with constants - zero, unit, top - and provide some strengthenings of Wurm's results towards including these constants into the systems involved.</description>

      <title>Kleene Algebrae, Kleene Modules, and Morita Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modules and the notion of Morita equivalence are foundational to the classical study of rings. These concepts extend naturally to semirings and then specialize to Kleene algebrae, and my goal is to investigate Kleene modules and Morita equivalence of Kleene algebrae in the hope that some of the power seen in the context of rings may be found in this new context as well.</description>

      <title>A proof-theoretic approach to uniform interpolation property of multi-agent modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform interpolation property (UIP) is a strengthening of Craig interpolation property. It was first established by Pitts(1992) based on a pure proof-theoretic method. UIP in multi-modal $\mathbf{K_n}$, $\mathbf{KD_n}$ and $\mathbf{KT_n}$ logic have been established by semantic approaches, however, a proof-theoretic approach is still lacking. B\'ilkov\'a (2007) develops the method in Pitts (1992) to show UIP in classical modal logic $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{KT}$. This paper further extends B\'ilkov\'a (2007)'s systems to establish the UIP in multi-agent modal logic $\mathbf{K_n}$, $\mathbf{KD_n}$ and $\mathbf{KT_n}$. A purely syntactic algorithm is presented to determine a uniform interpolant formula. It is also shown that quantification over propositional variables can be modeled by UIP in these systems. Furthermore, a direct argument to establish UIP without using second-order quantifiers is also presented.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalized a complete proof of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in the Lean4 theorem prover. For a local ring, rather than following the well-known proof that considers the residue field as the quotient of the ring by a regular sequence to compute projective dimension and uses the Koszul complex to show the dimension of the cotangent space is at most the global dimension, we prove the criterion via maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules and a weakened version of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem, which is more amenable to the formalization process and the current development of mathlib. Our formalization includes the construction of depth and of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, which are used frequently in the proof of the criterion. We also developed related results, including the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings and Hilbert's Syzygy theorem.</description>

      <title>The Singularity Theory of Concurrent Programs: A Topological Characterization and Detection of Deadlocks and Livelocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel paradigm for the analysis and verification of concurrent programs -- the Singularity Theory. We model the execution space of a concurrent program as a branched topological space, where program states are points and state transitions are paths. Within this framework, we characterize deadlocks as attractors and livelocks as non-contractible loops in the execution space. By employing tools from algebraic topology, particularly homotopy and homology groups, we define a series of concurrent topological invariants to systematically detect and classify these concurrent "singularities" without exhaustively traversing all states. This work aims to establish a geometric and topological foundation for concurrent program verification, transcending the limitations of traditional model checking.</description>

      <title>Have a thing? Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are perfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that neither logical tradition can normally permit the direct expression of arbitrary general-recursive functions without inconsistency. We introduce grounded arithmetic or GA, a minimalistic but nonetheless powerful foundation for formal reasoning that allows the direct expression of arbitrary recursive definitions. GA adjusts the traditional inference rules such that terms that express nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e., "bottom") instead of leading into logical paradox or inconsistency. Recursive functions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by "dynamically typing" terms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they denote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven terminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar classical rules. A mechanically-checked consistency proof in Isabelle/HOL exists for the basic quantifier-free fragment of GA. Quantifiers may be added atop this foundation as ordinary computations, whose inference rules are thus admissible and do not introduce new inconsistency risks. While GA is only a first step towards richly-typed grounded deduction practical for everyday use in manual or automated computational reasoning, it shows the promise that the expressive freedom of arbitrary recursive definition can in principle be incorporated into formal systems.</description>

      <title>Are Language Models Efficient Reasoners? A Perspective from Logic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Inaccessible Sets in Martin-L\"of Type Theory with One Mahlo Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15074v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rathjen proved that Aczel's constructive set theory $\mathbf{CZF}$ extended with inaccessible sets of all transfinite orders can be interpreted in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory $\mathbf{MLTT}$ extended with Setzer's Mahlo universe and another universe above it. In this paper we show that this interpretation can be carried out bottom-up without the universe above the Mahlo universe, provided we add an accessibility predicate instead. If we work in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory with extensional identity types the accessibility predicate can be defined in terms of $\mathrm{W}$-types. The main part of our interpretation has been formalised in the proof assistant Agda.</description>
