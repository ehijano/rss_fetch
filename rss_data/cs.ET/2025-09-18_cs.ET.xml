      <title>Design-Space Exploration of Distributed Neural Networks in Low-Power Wearable Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable devices are revolutionizing personal technology, but their usability is often hindered by frequent charging due to high power consumption. This paper introduces Distributed Neural Networks (DistNN), a framework that distributes neural network computations between resource-constrained wearable nodes and resource-rich hubs to reduce energy at the node without sacrificing performance. We define a Figure of Merit (FoM) to select the optimal split point that minimizes node-side energy. A custom hardware design using low-precision fixed-point arithmetic achieves ultra-low power while maintaining accuracy. The proposed system is ~1000x more energy efficient than a GPU and averages 11x lower power than recent machine learning (ML) ASICs at 30 fps. Evaluated with CNNs and autoencoders, DistNN attains an SSIM of 0.90 for image reconstruction and 0.89 for denoising, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, real-time wearable applications.</description>

      <title>Robust and Secure Computation Offloading and Trajectory Optimization for Multi-UAV MEC Against Aerial Eavesdropper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multi-access edge computing (MEC) appears as a popular paradigm to reduce task processing latency. However, the secure offloading is an important issue when occurring aerial eavesdropping. Besides, the potential uncertainties in practical applications and flexible trajectory optimizations of UAVs pose formidable challenges for realizing robust offloading. In this paper, we consider the aerial secure MEC network including ground users, service unmanned aerial vehicles (S-UAVs) integrated with edge servers, and malicious UAVs overhearing transmission links. To deal with the task computation complexities, which are characterized as uncertainties, a robust problem is formulated with chance constraints. The energy cost is minimized by optimizing the connections, trajectories of S-UAVs and offloading ratios. Then, the proposed non-linear problem is tackled via the distributionally robust optimization and conditional value-at-risk mechanism, which is further transformed into the second order cone programming forms. Moreover, we decouple the reformulated problem and design the successive convex approximation for S-UAV trajectories. The global algorithm is designed to solve the sub-problems in a block coordinate decent manner. Finally, extensive simulations and numerical analyses are conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithms, with just 2\% more energy cost compared with the ideal circumstance.</description>

      <title>Can I Trust This Chatbot? Assessing User Privacy in AI-Healthcare Chatbot Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into everyday life, AI-powered chatbot mobile applications are increasingly adopted across industries, particularly in the healthcare domain. These chatbots offer accessible and 24/7 support, yet their collection and processing of sensitive health data present critical privacy concerns. While prior research has examined chatbot security, privacy issues specific to AI healthcare chatbots have received limited attention. Our study evaluates the privacy practices of 12 widely downloaded AI healthcare chatbot apps available on the App Store and Google Play in the United States. We conducted a three-step assessment analyzing: (1) privacy settings during sign-up, (2) in-app privacy controls, and (3) the content of privacy policies. The analysis identified significant gaps in user data protection. Our findings reveal that half of the examined apps did not present a privacy policy during sign up, and only two provided an option to disable data sharing at that stage. The majority of apps' privacy policies failed to address data protection measures. Moreover, users had minimal control over their personal data. The study provides key insights for information science researchers, developers, and policymakers to improve privacy protections in AI healthcare chatbot apps.</description>

      <title>Threats and Security Strategies for IoMT Infusion Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) into healthcare systems has transformed patient care by enabling real-time monitoring, enhanced diagnostics, and enhanced operational efficiency. However, this increased connectivity has also expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals, raising significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. This study focuses on the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of IoMT infusion pumps, which are critical devices in modern healthcare. Through a targeted literature review of the past five years, we analyzed seven current studies from a pool of 132 papers to identify security vulnerabilities. Our findings indicate that infusion pumps face vulnerabilities such as device-level flaws, authentication and access control issues, network and communication weaknesses, data security and privacy risks, and operational or organizational challenges that can expose them to lateral attacks within healthcare networks. Our analysis synthesizes findings from seven recent studies to clarify how and why infusion pumps remain vulnerable in each of these areas. By categorizing the security gaps, we highlight critical risk patterns and their implications. This work underscores the scope of the issue and provides a structured understanding that is valuable for healthcare IT professionals and device manufacturers. Ultimately, the findings can inform the development of targeted, proactive security strategies to better safeguard infusion pumps and protect patient well-being.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Multi-Agent Vehicular Planning for Battery Efficiency and QoS in 6G Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While simulators exist for vehicular IoT nodes communicating with the Cloud through Edge nodes in a fully-simulated osmotic architecture, they often lack support for dynamic agent planning and optimisation to minimise vehicular battery consumption while ensuring fair communication times. Addressing these challenges requires extending current simulator architectures with AI algorithms for both traffic prediction and dynamic agent planning. This paper presents an extension of SimulatorOrchestrator (SO) to meet these requirements. Preliminary results over a realistic urban dataset show that utilising vehicular planning algorithms can lead to improved battery and QoS performance compared with traditional shortest path algorithms. The additional inclusion of desirability areas enabled more ambulances to be routed to their target destinations while utilising less energy to do so, compared to traditional and weighted algorithms without desirability considerations.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Explainable Model for Park-and-Ride Car Park Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a scenario of growing usage of park-and-ride facilities, understanding and predicting car park occupancy is becoming increasingly important. This study presents a model that effectively captures the occupancy patterns of park-and-ride car parks for commuters using truncated normal distributions for vehicle arrival and departure times. The objective is to develop a predictive model with minimal parameters corresponding to commuter behaviour, enabling the estimation of parking saturation and unfulfilled demand. The proposed model successfully identifies the regular, periodic nature of commuter parking behaviour, where vehicles arrive in the morning and depart in the afternoon. It operates using aggregate data, eliminating the need for individual tracking of arrivals and departures. The model's predictive and now-casting capabilities are demonstrated through real-world data from car parks in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. A simple model extension furthermore enables the prediction of when a car park will reach its occupancy limit and estimates the additional spaces required to accommodate such excess demand. Thus, beyond forecasting, the model serves as a valuable tool for evaluating interventions, such as expanding parking capacity, to optimize park-and-ride facilities.</description>

      <title>Deciding how to respond: A deliberative framework to guide policymaker responses to AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discourse on responsible artificial intelligence (AI) regulation is understandably dominated by risk-focused assessments and analyses. This approach reflects the fundamental uncertainty policymakers face when determining appropriate responses to current, emerging and novel AI systems. In this article, we argue that by operationalising the concept of freedom - the philosophical counterpart to responsibility - a complementary approach centred on the potential societal benefits of AI systems can be developed. The result is a discursive framework grounded in freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity, which represent the two main intellectual traditions of interpreting freedom. We contend that the complexity, ambiguity and contestation involved in regulating AI systems make a deliberative paradigm more useful than the conventional technical one. The resulting framework is structured around coordinative, communicative and decision spaces, each with sequential focal points and associated outputs.</description>
