      <title>Remarks on two problems by Hassett</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the ultimate goals of the Hassett-Keel program is the determination of the log canonical models of the moduli spaces of pointed rational curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$. In this paper, we study log canonical models of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,5}$ with \textit{asymmetric} boundary divisors. Our results generalize previous work by Alexeev-Swinarski, Fedorchuk-Smyth, Kiem-Moon and Simpson for the case $n=5$. We prove that all moduli spaces of weighted pointed rational curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,\mathcal{A}}$ arise as log canonical models of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,5}$ for suitable choices of boundary coefficients, thereby also recovering a theorem of Fedorchuk and Moon. In addition, we relate these moduli spaces to Deligne-Mostow ball quotients. We further study log canonical models of the moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n\cdot (1/k)}$ with symmetric weight, which differ from $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Hodge Conjecture: A Spectral Fingerprint Approach via Gauss-Manin Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symbolic analytic framework for addressing the Hodge Conjecture, based on a refined invariant called the Hermitian spectral fingerprint. By projecting out $(k,k)$ components from holomorphic forms and their Gauss Manin derivatives, we define a fingerprint functional that vanishes identically for any rational cohomology class of type $(k,k)$. We prove unconditionally that the projected derivatives span the entire orthogonal complement of $H^{k,k}(X)$ in $H^{2k}(X,\mathbb{C})$, implying structural vanishing. This vanishing criterion across realizations leads to absolute Hodge behavior and, by deep results in arithmetic geometry, confirms algebraicity. Thus, the Hodge Conjecture is resolved within this framework.</description>

      <title>Some concerns on the border rank of Kronecker products of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides a detailed proof of Conner--Gesmundo--Landsberg--Ventura's result that the border rank of the Kronecker square of the little Coppersmith--Winograd tensor is $(q+2)^{2}$.We also indicate how the same ideas seem to extend to the case of the Kronecker cube, pointing toward the conjectural value $(q+2)^{m}$ for $m\ge 4$, although a full proof is left for future work.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow varieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements.
  The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar \to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about $I$-functions of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Exceptional Set of a Three-Component Curve on Hirzebruch Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebraic exceptional set of a three-component curve $B$ with normal crossings on a Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_e$. If $K_{\mathbb{F}_{e}}+B$ is big and no component of $B$ is a fiber or the rational curve with negative self-intersection, we prove that the algebraic exceptional set is finite, and in most cases give it an effective bound. We also prove that the algebraic exceptional set coincides with the set of curves that are hyper-bitangent to $B$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algebro-geometric interpretation of the Schur and Macdonald indices of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs). We conjecture that there exists an affine scheme $X$ such that the Hilbert series of the (appropriately-graded) arc space of its polynomial ring $J_\infty(\mathbb{C}[X])$ encodes the indices. Distinct local descriptions of a (singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product expansions. We test our conjecture across a variety of (generalized) Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories.</description>

      <title>Cactus flower spaces and monodromy of Bethe vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of cactus flower moduli spaces $\overline{F}_n$ and Gaudin models started in arXiv:2308.06880, arXiv:2407.06424. We show that isomorphism classes of operadic coverings of the real form $\overline{F}_n(\mathbb{R})$ are naturally one-to-one with equivalence classes of concrete coboundary monoidal categories (i.e. coboundary monoidal categories that admit a faithful monoidal functor to sets) with certain semisimplicity and finiteness conditions. Following the strategy of arXiv:1708.05105, for any complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we recover Kashiwara $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals, as a concrete coboundary category, from the coverings given by Bethe eigenlines for inhomogeneous Gaudin models. Using this, we compute the monodromy of Bethe eigenlines for trigonometric Gaudin models over two different real loci. In the particular case of minuscule highest weights, this can be regarded as combinatorial version of the wall-crossing conjecture of Bezrukavnikov and Okounkov for quantum cohomology of symplectic resolutions in the case of minuscule resolutions of slices in the affine Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>On the K-theory of algebraic tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an algebraic torus $T$ over a field $F$, its lattice of characters $\Lambda$ gives rise to a topological torus $\mathfrak{T}(T)=\Lambda_{\mathbb R}/\Lambda$ with a continuous action of the absolute Galois group $G$. We construct a natural equivalence between the algebraic $K$-theory $K_{\ast}(T)$ and the equivariant homology $H^{G}_{\ast}(\mathfrak{T}(T);K_G(F))$ of the topological torus $\mathfrak{T}(T)$ with coefficients in the $G$-equivariant $K$-theory of $F$. This generalizes a computation of $K_0(T)$ due to Merkurjev and Panin. We obtain this equivalence by analyzing the motive $\mathbb{K}_{F}^{T}$ in the stable motivic category $\mathrm{SH}(F)$ of Voevodsky and Morel, where $\mathbb{K}_{F}$ is the motivic spectrum representing homotopy $K$-theory. We construct a natural comparison map $\mathfrak{F}\colon \mathbb{K}_{F}[B\Lambda] \to \mathbb{K}_{F}^{T}$ from the $\mathbb{K}_{F}$-homology of the \'etale delooping of $\Lambda$ to $\mathbb{K}_{F}^{T}$ as a special case of a motivic Fourier transform and prove that it is an equivalence by using a motivic Eilenberg--Moore formula for classifying spaces of tori.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Six Functor Formalisms via Structured Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay out an infinity categorical interpretation of reconstruction theorems which are germane to the symmetric monoidal perspective of noncommutative algebraic geometry, present sufficient conditions which allow for the factorization of certain six functor formalisms through animated S-stacks, and give a six functor formalism through which the aforementioned six functor formalisms factor through. Furthermore, and what is arguably the main feat of this article, these achievements, though in appearance arising from disparate concerns, are realized in the dissipation of a familiar thematic tension: that between space and quantity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the cave polynomial of a polymatroid and show that it yields a valuative function on polymatroids. The support of this polynomial after homogenization is again a polymatroid. The cave polynomial gives a $K$-theoretic description of a polymatroid in the augmented $K$-ring of a multisymmetric lift. As applications, we settle two conjectures: one by Bandari, Bayati, and Herzog regarding polymatroidal ideals, and another by Castillo, Cid-Ruiz, Mohammadi, and Monta\~no regarding the M\"obius support of a polymatroid.</description>

Abstract: We construct natural extensions of the Kudla--Millson generating series of cohomology classes of special cycles in compactified unitary Shimura varieties of signature $(n+1,1)$ and prove that they are holomorphic Hermitian modular forms. This proves the cohomological version of a conjecture of Kudla and Bruinier--Rosu--Zemel, in all codimensions up to the middle. We also develop the theory of Hermitian quasi-modular forms, with a particular focus on polynomial weighted theta functions, and prove that the generating series of Zariski closures of special cycles is a Hermitian quasi-modular form.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the configuration space of orbits, a generalization of the configuration space of points but for algebraic varieties that are acted by an algebraic reductive group. The main objective of this work is to study the $E$-polynomials of these spaces and their quotients by $S_n$. For this purpose, we develop a novel method for computing the $S_n$-equivariant $E$-polynomial of an algebraic variety, and we apply it to this kind of varieties.</description>

      <title>Effective atypical intersections and applications to orbit closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unifying setting for dealing with monodromically atypical intersections that goes beyond the usual Zilber-Pink conjecture. In particular we obtain a new proof of finiteness of the maximal atypical orbit closures in each stratum of translation surfaces $\Omega \mathcal{M}_g (\kappa)$, as given by Eskin, Filip, and Wright. We also describe a concrete algorithm, implementable in principle on a computer, which provably computes all maximal orbit closures which are 'atypical' in a sense described by Filip. The same methods also give a general algorithm for computing atypical special loci associated to systems of differential equations, and in particular give an effective and o-minimal free proof of the geometric Zilber-Pink conjecture for variations of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Inversion of the Abel--Prym map in presence of an additional involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike Abel map of the symmetric power of a Riemann surface onto its Jacobian, the Abel--Prym map generically can not be reversed by means of conventional technique related to the Jacobi inversion problem, and of its main ingredient, namely the Riemann vanishing theorem. It happens because the corresponding analog of the Riemann vanishing theorem gives twice as many points as the dimension of the Prym variety. However, if the Riemann surface has a second involution commuting with the one defining the Prym variety and satisfying a certain additional condition, an analog of the Jacobi inversion can be defined, and expressed in terms of the Prym theta function. We formulate these conditions and refer to the pairs of involutions satisfying them as to pairs of the first type. We formulate necessary conditions for the pair of involutions to be a pair of the first type, and give a series of examples of curves with such pairs of involutions, mainly spectral curves of Hitchin systems, and also a spectral curve of the Kovalewski system.</description>

      <title>Abhyankar-Moh Semigroups for arbitrary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary hypersurface singularity, we construct a family of semigroups associated with algebraically closed fields that arise as an infinite union of rings of series. These semigroups extend the value semigroup of a plane curve studied by Abhyankar and Moh. The algebraically closed fields under consideration possess a natural valuation that induces a corresponding value semigroup. We establish the necessary conditions under which these semigroups are independent of the choice of the root. Moreover, the extensions proposed by P. Gonz\'alez and Kiyek-Micus, where Gonz\'alez specifically addresses the case of quasi-ordinary singularities, and the extension introduced by Abbas-Assi, can be understood as particular instances within our constructed family.</description>

      <title>Dream resolution and principalization I: enough derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a first paper in a project on extending the dream principalization and resolution methods of [ATW24], [McQ20] and [Que22] to quasi-excellent, logarithmic and relative settings. We show that the main results of [ATW24] extend to regular schemes with enough derivations and are functorial with respect to all regular morphisms. This is already strong enough to formally imply that the same results hold in other categories, such as complex and p-adic analytic spaces. Our method has many common points with that of [ATW24], but the accent is now shifted towards the study of weighted centers and their coordinate presentations. Not only we hope that this is a bit simpler and more conceptual, this method will be easily applied in the logarithmic and relative settings in the sequel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact normal K\"ahler space whose canonical sheaf is a rank-one free $\mathcal O_X$ module and whose singularities are isolated, rational and quasi-homogeneous. We prove then that under a topological hypothesis the obstruction to deforming $X$ concentrates upon its singularities, generalizing partially the results of Namikawa--Gross. We prove also that under a certain hypothesis the locally trivial deformations of $X$ are unobstructed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that, when an abelian scheme has semi-abelian degeneration along normal crossings divisor in a regular base scheme, a finite flat group scheme of torsion points of the abelian scheme degenerates to a log finite group scheme, which captures more information than a quasi-finite flat group scheme of torsion points of the semi-abelian scheme.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Pierce--Birkhoff conjecture for splines, i.e., continuous piecewise polynomials of degree $d$ in $n$ variables on a hyperplane partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$, can be written as a finite lattice combination of polynomials. We will provide a purely existential proof, followed by a more in-depth analysis that yields effective bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Shimura varieties associated to a unitary group of signature $(n-s,s)$ where $n$ is even. For these varieties, we construct smooth $p$-adic integral models for $s=1$ and regular $p$-adic integral models for $s=2$ and $s=3$ over odd primes $p$ which ramify in the imaginary quadratic field with level subgroup at $p$ given by the stabilizer of a $\pi$-modular lattice in the hermitian space. Our construction, which has an explicit moduli-theoretic description, is given by an explicit resolution of a corresponding local model.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry and the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture predicts the existence of hypothetical "Breuil-Mezard cycles" in the moduli space of mod $p$ Galois representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_q/\mathbb{Q}_q)$ that should govern congruences between mod $p$ automorphic forms. For generic parameters, we propose a construction of Breuil-M\'{e}zard cycles in arbitrary rank, and verify that they satisfy the Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture for all sufficiently generic tame types and small Hodge-Tate weights. Our method is purely local and group-theoretic, and completely distinct from previous approaches to the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture. In particular, we leverage new connections between the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture and phenomena occurring in homological mirror symmetry and geometric representation theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be a field. In this paper, we consider Double Danielewski type algebras over an affine factorial $k$-domain $R$. We observe that this family produces a non-cancellative family of algebras over $R$. Further, when $k$ is a field of characteristic zero, we give a characterization for an affine algebra to be isomorphic to an algebra of Double Danielewski type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Lefschetz trace formula for B\"ockle-Pink crystals on tame Deligne-Mumford stacks of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and apply it to the crystal associated to the universal Drinfeld module. Combined with the Eichler-Shimura theory developed by B\"ockle, this leads to a trace formula for Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms. As an application, we deduce a Ramanujan bound on the traces of Hecke operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of the Galois orbits of generic sequences of algebraic points of small height in a projective variety over a number field. Our main result is a generalization of Yuan's equidistribution theorem that applies to heights for which Zhang's lower bound for the essential minimum is not necessarily an equality. It extends to all projective varieties a theorem of Burgos Gil, Philippon, Rivera-Letelier and the second author for toric varieties. It also applies to sums of canonical heights for an algebraic dynamical system, and in particular it recovers K\"uhne's semiabelian equidistribution theorem. We also generalize previous work of Chambert-Loir and Thuillier to obtain new logarithmic equidistribution results. Finally we extend our main result to the quasi-projective setting recently introduced by Yuan and Zhang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to explore complete intersection monomial curves from a contemporary perspective. The main goal is to help readers understand the intricate connections within the field and its potential applications. The properties of any monomial curve singularity will be first reviewed, highlighting the interaction between combinatorial and algebraic properties. Next, we will revisit the two main characterizations of complete intersection monomial curves. One is based on deep algebraic properties given by Herzog and Kunz in 1971, while the other is based on a combinatorial approach given by Delorme in 1976. Our aim is to bridge the gap between these perspectives present in the current literature. Then, we will focus on recent advances that show an intriguing connection between numerical semigroups and Alexander polynomials of knots. Finally, we will revisit the deformation theory of these curves.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We observe that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a matroid Schubert variety and prove that the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar {\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ are divisors indexed by root system data. We prove that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety and find an affine paving of $\bar {\mathfrak h},$ where the strata are given by the orbits of $\mathfrak h.$ We show that the strata of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ correspond bijectively to subspaces of the corresponding Coxeter hyperplane arrangement studied by Orlik and Solomon, and prove that the associated posets are isomorphic. As a consequence, we express the Betti numbers of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ in terms of well-known combinatorial invariants in the classical cases. We show that the Weyl group $W$ acts on $\bar {\mathfrak h}$, and describe $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb C)$ as a representation of $W$, and compute the cup product for $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb Z)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of polynomial ideals and Gr\"obner bases has been studied since the 1980s. In recent years, the related notions of polynomial subalgebras and SAGBI bases have gained more and more attention in computational algebra, with a view towards effective algorithms. We investigate the computational complexity of the subalgebra membership problem and degree bounds. In particular, we show completeness for the complexity class EXPSPACE and prove PSPACE-completeness for homogeneous algebras. We highlight parallels and differences compared to the settings of ideals, and also look at important classes of polynomials such as monomial algebras.</description>

      <title>Color Image Set Recognition Based on Quaternionic Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for recognizing color image sets using quaternionic Grassmannians, which use the power of quaternions to capture color information and represent each color image set as a point on the quaternionic Grassmannian. We provide a direct formula to calculate the shortest distance between two points on the quaternionic Grassmannian, and use this distance to build a new classification framework. Experiments on the ETH-80 benchmark dataset and and the Highway Traffic video dataset show that our method achieves good recognition results. We also discuss some limitations in stability and suggest ways the method can be improved in the future.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Topological Sigma Models and Doubling Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Witten's topological B-model on a Calabi-Yau background is known to reproduce, in the open string sector, the derived category of coherent sheaves. When the target space is a complex torus, the topological model enjoys a non-geometric symmetry known as T-duality, which relates the theories on the torus and dual torus backgrounds. By considering the "double field theory" of Hull and Reid-Edwards on the product of a torus and its dual, T-duality occurs as a geometric symmetry of the target space.
  Building on the methods of Y. Qin, we propose a method of analyzing the topological B-model on a torus in the doubled geometry framework which naturally incorporates certain rank-one D-branes, providing a different perspective on the derived category of the torus. In certain cases, the intersection theory of these lifted branes correctly computes the BRST cohomology of the B-model, and hence the derived Hom-spaces of the corresponding line bundles.</description>
