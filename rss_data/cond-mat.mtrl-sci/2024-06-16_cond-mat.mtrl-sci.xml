      <title>Grain growth phenomenon during pressure-induced phase transformations at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant grain growth is observed during the high-pressure phase transformations (PTs) at room temperature within an hour for various materials. However, no existing theory explains this phenomenon since nanocrystals do not grow at room temperature even over a time span of several years because of slow diffusion. Here, we suggest a multistep mechanism for the grain growth during $\alpha\rightarrow\omega$ PT in Zr. Phase interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) coincide and move together under the action of a combined thermodynamic driving forces. Several intermediate steps for such motion are suggested and justified kinetically. Nonhydrostatic stresses due to volume reduction in the growing $\omega$ grain promote continuous growth of the existing $\omega$ grain instead of a new nucleation at other GBs. In situ synchrotron Laue diffraction experiments confirm the main predictions of the theory. The suggested mechanism provides a new insight into synergistic interaction between PTs and microstructure evolution.</description>

      <title>Stability of monodomain III-V crystals and antiphase boundaries over a Si monoatomic step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we compare the stabilities of different III-V crystals configurations on stepped Si substrates, with or without anti-phase boundaries, for abrupt and compensated interfaces, using density functional theory. Thermodynamic stability of the different heterostructures is analyzed with an atomic scale description of charge densities distribution and mechani-cal strain. We show that the configuration where a III-V crystal adapts to a Si monoatomic step through change of charge compensation at the hetero-interface is much more stable than the configuration in which an antiphase boundary is formed. This study thus demonstrates that antiphase boundaries commonly observed in III-V/Si samples are not origi-nating from Si monoatomic step edges but from inevitable kinetically driven coalescence of monophase 3D III-V islands.</description>

      <title>Alkali-metal vibrations in bcc, fcc, hcp, and 9R structures: Implications for the energetics of Li and Na martensitic phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an embedded-atom-method (EAM) model that is specifically designed to accurately describe vibrations in bcc alkali metals. Using this model, we study bulk vibrational structure of Li, Na, K, and Rb when configured in bcc and the closed-packed (cp) fcc, hcp, and 9$R$ phases. From the vibrational density of states for each phase we thence find the corresponding vibrational contribution $A_{\rm vib}(T)$ to the Helmholtz free energy $A(T)$. Utilizing (i) differences in $A_{\rm vib}(T)$ between the bcc and cp structures and (ii) experimentally inferred thermodynamic transition temperatures for Li and Na (which martensitically transform from bcc to cp phases upon cooling), we extract values for zero-temperature energy differences between the bcc and relevant cp phases. We also put constraints on zero-temperature cp-bcc energy differences for K and Rb, which do not exhibit temperature induced transitions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Atomic Scale Polarization Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects, such as vortices and skyrmions in magnetic and dipolar systems, can give rise to properties that are not observed in typical magnets or dielectrics. Here, we report the discovery of an atomic-scale dipolar vortex lattice in the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase of BaTiS3, a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) hexagonal chalcogenide, using X-ray synchrotron single-crystal diffraction studies. The vortex lattice consists of a periodic array of vortex-vortex-antivortex patterns composed of electric dipoles from off-center displacements of octahedrally coordinated Ti atoms. Using first-principles calculations and phenomenological modeling, we show that the dipolar vortex lattice in BaTiS3 arises from the coupling between multiple lattice instabilities arising from flat, soft phonon bands. This mechanism contrasts with classical dipolar textures in ferroelectric heterostructures that emerge from the competition between electrostatic and strain energies, and necessitate a dimensional reduction in the form of thin films and heterostructures to stabilize the textures. The observation of dipolar vortices in BaTiS3 brings the ultimate scaling limit for dipolar topologies down to about a nanometer and unveils the intimate connection between crystal symmetry and real-space topology. Our work sets up zero-filling triangular lattice materials with instabilities as a playground for realizing and understanding quantum polarization topologies.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac Fermions and Strong Shubnikov-de Haas Oscillations in Topological Insulator Sm,Fe:Bi2Se3 Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are emergent materials with unique band structure, which allow the study of quantum effect in solids, as well as contribute to high performance quantum devices. To achieve the better performance of TI, here we present a co-doping strategy using synergistic rare-earth Sm and transition-metal Fe dopants in Bi2Se3 single crystals, which combine the advantages of both transition metal doped TI (high ferromagnetic ordering temperature and observed QAHE), and rare-earth doped TI (large magnetic moments and significant spin orbit coupling). In the as-grown single crystals, clear evidences of ferromagnetic ordering were observed. The angle resolve photoemission spectroscopy indicate the ferromagnetism opens a 44 meV band gap at surface Dirac point. Moreover, the carrier mobility at 3 K is ~ 7400 cm2/Vs, and we thus observed an ultra-strong Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in the longitudinal resistivity, as well as the Hall steps in transverse resistivity below 14 T. Our transport and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy results suggest that the rare-earth and transition metal co-doping in Bi2Se3 system is a promising avenue implement the quantum anomalous Hall effect, as well as harnessing the massive Dirac fermion in electrical devices.</description>

      <title>Connecting the hexagonal closed packed structure with the cuboidal lattices: A Burgers-Bain type martensitic transformation for a Lennard-Jones solid derived from exact lattice summations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusionless martensitic phase transition from a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) arrangement to the face-centered close-packed (fcc) and subsequently the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice is discussed for a Lennard-Jones solid. The associated lattice vectors to construct the underlying bi-lattice for a Burgers-Bain-type of transformation require a minimum of four parameters $(a,\alpha,\beta,\gamma=c/a)$ describing, beside the change in the base lattice parameters $a$ and $c$, the shear force acting on the hexagonal base plane through the parameter $\alpha$, and the sliding force of the middle layer in the original AB hexagonal packing arrangement through the parameter $\beta$. By optimizing the lattice parameters $a$ and $\beta$ for a $(n,m)$-Lennard-Jones potential, we obtain a simple two-dimensional picture for the complete Burgers-Bain-type hcp$\leftrightarrow$fcc$\leftrightarrow$bcc phase transition. From the generalized lattice vectors we were able to construct the corresponding lattice sums in terms of inverse power potentials applying fast converging Bessel function expansions using a Terras decomposition of the Epstein zeta function combined with a Van der Hoff-Benson expansion for the lattice sums. This allows the cohesive energy to be determined to computer precision for a Lennard-Jones solid. For six different combinations of $(n,m)$-Lennard-Jones potentials the energy $(\alpha,\gamma)$ hypersurface was then mapped out and studied in more detail. We show that for a Lennard-Jones model the minimum energy path is found to be a two-step hcp$\rightarrow$fcc$\rightarrow$bcc transition process. The lowest transition state in each case can be regarded as an upper limit to a hypothetical true minimum energy path out of the many possibilities in a hcp$\leftrightarrow$fcc$\leftrightarrow$bcc phase transition.</description>

      <title>An alternate approach for estimating grain-growth kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate of grain growth, which aides in achieving desired properties in polycrystalline materials, is conventionally estimated by measuring the size of grains and tracking its change in micrographs reflecting the temporal evolution. Techniques adopting this conventional approach demand an absolute distinction between the grains and the interface separating them to yield an accurate result. Edge-detection, segmentation and other deep-learning algorithms are increasingly adopted to expose the network of boundaries and the associated grains precisely. An alternate approach for measuring grain-growth kinetics, that curtails the need for advanced image-processing treatment, is presented in this work. Grain-growth rate in the current technique is ascertained by \textit{counting} the number of triple-( and quadruple-) junctions, and monitoring its change during the microstructural evolution. The shifted focus of this junction-based treatment minimises the significance of a well-defined grain-boundary network, and consequently, the involvement of the sophisticated techniques that expose them. A regression-based object-detection algorithm is extended to realise, and count, the number of junctions in polycrystalline microstructures. By examining the change in the number of junctions with time, the growth rate is subsequently determined.Growth kinetics estimated by the present junction-based approach, across a wide-range of multiphase polycrystalline microstructures, agree convincingly with the outcomes of the conventional treatment.Besides offering a novel technique for grain-growth measurement, the analysis accompanying the current work unravels a trend, compatible with the topological events, in the progressive evolution of the triple-junctions count. The present approach, through its underlying algorithm, provides a promising option for monitoring grain-growth during in-situ investigations.</description>

      <title>The inadequacy of the geometric features of MA islands in relating bainite microstructures to composition and processing conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving desired properties in bainite steels with MA islands demands understanding the affect of processing conditions and composition on their size and morphology. Generally, this understanding is gained by studying the change in the size and morphology of the MA islands with composition and the processing conditions. In the present work, around 8500 MA islands dispersed across of approximately 1500 bainite microstructures are investigated to comprehend the influence of composition and heat treatment cycle on the geometric features. The geometric features considered in this study include polygon area metric, compactness and aspect ratio. A thorough statistical analysis of these features across bainite steels of different compositions and processing conditions unravel that, though there are minor changes, no characteristic variation is introduced in the size and morphology of the MA islands. In other words, the distribution of the various forms of MA islands are almost identical in bainite steels of different chemistry and heat treatment, thereby indicating the inadequacy of geometric features in explicating the affect of processing conditions on microstructure.</description>

      <title>Interpretable MA-island clusters and fingerprints relating bainite microstructures to composition and processing temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realising the affect of composition and processing condition on bainite microstructures is often challenging, owing to the intricate distribution of the constituent phases. In this work, scanning electron micrographs of non-isothermally transformed bainite, with martensite-austenite (MA) islands, are analysed to relate the microstructures to the composition and quench-stop temperature. The inadequacy of the MA-islands' geometric features, namely aspect ratio, polygon area and compactness, in establishing this relation is made evident from Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence at the outset. Clustering the bainite microstructures, following a combination of feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, further fails to realise the affect of composition and processing temperature. Deep-learning analysis of the individual MA islands, in contrast to the bainite microstructures, yields interpretable clusters with characteristically distinct size and morphology. These five clusters, referred to as fine- and coarse-dendrite, fine- and coarse-polygon and elongated, are exceptionally discernible and can be adopted to describe any MA island. Characterising the bainite microstructures, based on the distribution of the interpretable MA-island clusters, generates \textit{fingerprints} that sufficiently relates the composition and processing conditions with the microstructures.</description>

      <title>Synergetic effect of edge states and point defects to tune ferromagnetism in CVD-grown vertical nanostructured MoS2: A correlation between electronic structure and theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) exhibited by nanostructured two-dimensional semiconductors for spintronics applications is a fascinating area of research. The present work reports on the correlation between the electronic structure and magnetic properties of defect-engineered nano-structured MoS2 thin films. Low-energy light and heavy-mass ion irradiation have been performed to create defects and tune magnetic properties. Vertical nanosheets with edge state termination in the pristine sample have been examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Deterioration of vertical nanosheets is observed in low-energy Ar+ and Xe+ irradiated samples. An appreciably high magnetization value of 1.7 emu/g was observed for edge-oriented nanostructured pristine MoS2 thin films, which decreased after ion irradiation. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, it is evident that, due to oxygen incorporation in the sulfur vacancy sites, Mo5+ and 6+ states increase after ion irradiation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the edge-oriented spins of the prismatic edges of the vertical nanosheets are primarily responsible for the high magnetic moment in the pristine film, and the edge degradation and reduction in sulfur vacancies by the incorporation of oxygen upon irradiation result in a decrease in the magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Substrate$-$bias driven Sputter deposited $\beta-$phase dominated Tungsten film for Spintronic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta$-Tungsten ($\beta$-W), a A15 cubic phase of Tungsten exhibits giant spin hall angle as compared to its bcc-phase $\alpha$-Tungsten ($\alpha$-W), making high quality $\beta$-W film desirable for spin-based application. We report on the substrate bias driven on-demand growth of $\beta$-W film on SiO$_2$ coated silicon (SiO$_2$/Si) using DC sputtering. GIXRD plots and SEM images are used to show a systematic change on the structure and grain size of the deposited films with the application of substrate bias. It is observed that zero bias film are amorphous in nature and changes phase from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ or mixed ($\alpha$ + $\beta$) depending upon the sign and magnitude of the substrate bias. We performed One-Dimensional Power spectrum density of the AFM images which revealed that the pure $\beta$-W film grown at a positive bias of +50V has the minimum roughness as compared to films grown at different substrate bias. We further confirm the metallic surface homogeneity using the room temperature STM. Our results shows that the substrate bias which controls the energy of the deposited atom, is a crucial parameter for an on demand growth of $\beta$-W, an important material for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Vertically Graded FeNi Alloys with Low Damping and a Sizeable Spin-Orbit Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $\theta_\mathrm{AD} \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>On identifying dynamic length scales in crystal plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials are often heterogeneous at various length scales, with variations in grain structure, defects, and composition which has a strong influence on the emergent macroscopic plastic behavior. In particular, heterogeneities lead to fluctuations in the plastic response in the form of jerky flow and ubiquitous strain bursts. One of the crucial aspects of plasticity modeling is scale bridging: In order to deliver physically correct crystal plasticity models, one needs to determine relevant microstructural length scales. In this paper we advance the idea that continuum descriptions of dislocation mediated plasticity cannot neglect dynamic correlations related to the avalanche behavior. We present an extensive weakest link analysis of crystal plasticity by means of three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations with and without spherical precipitates. We investigate strain bursts and related length scales and conclude that while sufficiently strong obstacles to dislocation motion tend to confine the dislocation avalanches within well-defined sub-volumes, in pure dislocation systems the avalanches may span the system, implying that the dynamic length scale is, in fact, the size of the entire sample. Consequences of this finding on continuum modeling are thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Magnetic Transition Temperatures and the Rare Earth Exchange Interaction in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of functional oxide heterostructures are strongly influenced by the physics governing their interfaces. Modern deposition techniques allow us to accurately engineer the interface physics through the growth of atomically precise heterostructures. This enables minute control over the electronic, magnetic, and structural characteristics. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of tailor-made superlattices employing the ferromagnetic and insulating double perovskites RE$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (RE = La, Nd), featuring distinct Curie temperatures. Adjusting the superlattice periodicity at the unit cell level allows us to engineer their magnetic phase diagram. Large periodicity superlattices conserve the individual para- to ferromagnetic transitions of the La$_2$NiMnO$_6$ and Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ parent compounds. As the superlattice periodicity is reduced, the Curie temperatures of the superlattice constituents converge and, finally, collapse into one single transition for the lowest period samples. This is a consequence of the magnetic order parameter propagating across the superlattice interfaces, as supported by a minimal Landau theory model. Further, we find that the Nd-Ni/Mn exchange interaction can be enhanced by the superlattice interfaces. This leads to a field-induced reversal of the Nd magnetic moments, as confirmed by synchrotron X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements and supported by first-principles calculations. Our work demonstrates how superlattice engineering can be employed to fine-tune the magnetic properties in oxide heterostructures and broadens our understanding of magnetic interfacial effects.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state dislocation creep of olivine controlled by dislocation interactions at the isostress endmember</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheological behaviour of olivine deforming by dislocation creep controls geodynamic processes that involve steady-state flow or transient viscosity evolution. Longstanding rheological models applied to both contexts assume that dislocation creep of olivine aggregates occurs close to the isostrain endmember with each grain deforming to the same strain but supporting different stress. Here, we test this assumption by constructing isostrain and isostress models based on flow laws for single crystals and comparing them to rheological data for aggregates. This analysis reveals that strain rates measured on olivine aggregates agree with those predicted by the isostress model but are an order of magnitude faster than those predicted by the isostrain model. When extrapolated to conditions typical of the shallow upper mantle, the isostress model predicts steady-state viscosities that are one to three orders of magnitude less than those predicted by the isostrain model. Furthermore, deformation close to the isostress endmember implies that transient creep occurs predominantly by dislocation interactions, suggesting viscosity changes that are approximately one order of magnitude greater than those predicted previously based on grain interactions associated with the isostrain model.</description>

      <title>Insulating Half-Heusler TmPdSb with Unusual Band Order and Metallic Surface States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental results exploring a half-Heusler compound TmPdSb with unusual band order and metallic surface states. Typically, the half-Heusler systems exhibit topological features in a semimetallic state, and trivial ones in an insulating state. Topological properties of the most of half-Heusler systems are related to the band inversion around the Fermi level, similar to this observed in CdTe/HgTe systems. In the case of TmPdSb we observed the gapped electronic band structure with ``band inversion'' in the conductance band, while the slab-like system realized metallic surface states. The bulk insulating nature of the compound was corroborated by means of electrical transport measurements. The experimental data revealed several features due to the presence of metallic surface states, such as linear magnetoresistance and weak-antilocalization effect, characterized by enhanced coherence length and a very large number of surface conductive channels. Our findings reveal new features of the rare-earth half-Heusler.</description>

      <title>A micromechanical study of heat treatment induced hardening in {\alpha}-brass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms that govern a previously unexplained hardening effect of a single phase Cu-30wt%Zn {\alpha}-brass after heating have been investigated. After cold-work, the alloy possesses an increased yield strength and hardening rate only when heat treated to temperatures close to 220{^\circ}C, and is otherwise softer. Crystallographic texture and microstructure, explored using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), describe the deformation heterogeneity including twin development, as a function of heat treatment. When heated, an increased area fraction of deformation twins is observed, with dimensions reaching a critical size that maximises the resistance to dislocation slip in the parent grains. The effect is shown to dominate over other alloy characteristics including short range order, giving serrated yielding during tensile testing which is mostly eliminated after heating. In-situ X-ray diffraction during tensile testing corroborates these findings; dislocation-related line broadening and lattice strain development between as worked and heated {\alpha}-brass is directly related to the interaction between the dislocations and the population of deformation twins. The experiments unambiguously disprove that other thermally-induced microstructure features contribute to thermal hardening. Specifically, the presence of recrystallised grains or second phases do not play a role. As these heat treatments match annealing conditions subjected to {\alpha}-brass during deformation-related manufacturing processes, the results here are considered critical to understand, predict and exploit, where appropriate, any beneficial process-induced structural behaviour.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Mg$_2$IrH$_5$: A potential pathway to high-$T_c$ hydride superconductivity at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following long-standing predictions associated with hydrogen, high-temperature superconductivity has recently been observed in several hydride-based materials. Nevertheless, these high-$T_c$ phases only exist at extremely high pressures, and achieving high transition temperatures at ambient pressure remains a major challenge. Recent predictions of the complex hydride Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ may help overcome this challenge with calculations of high-$T_c$ superconductivity (65 K$~&lt;~T_c~&lt;~$ 170 K) in a material that is stable at atmospheric pressure. In this work, the synthesis of Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ was targeted over a broad range of $P$-$T$ conditions, and the resulting products were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrational spectroscopy, in concert with first-principles calculations. The results indicate that the charge-balanced complex hydride Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{5}$ is more stable over all conditions tested up to ca 28 GPa. The resulting hydride is isostructural with the predicted superconducting Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ phase except for a single hydrogen vacancy, which shows a favorable replacement barrier upon insertion of hydrogen into the lattice. Bulk Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{5}$ is readily accessible at mild $P$-$T$ conditions and may thus represent a convenient platform to access superconducting Mg$_{2}$IrH$_{6}$ via non-equilibrium processing methods.</description>

      <title>Ultra-bright and energy-efficient quantum-dot LEDs by idealizing charge injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lighting and display, relying on electric and optical down-conversion emission with sluggish power efficiency, account for &gt;15% global electricity consumption1,2. In 2014, quantum-dot (QD) LEDs (QLEDs) with near-optimal external quantum efficiency emerged3 and promised a pathway to avoid the vast down-conversion energy loss4,5. Despite a decade of progress4-22, fabrication of energy-efficient QLEDs with application-relevant brightness remains elusive. Here, the main roadblock is identified as the oxidative species adsorbed in the nanocrystalline electron-injection layer of QLEDs, which is then addressed by a simple reductive treatment to simultaneously boosts electron conductivity and hole blockage of the electron-injection layer. The resulting sub-bandgap-driven QLEDs with optimal efficiency achieve ultra-high brightness across the entire visible spectrum at least 2.6-fold higher than existing benchmarks. The brightness fully satisfies the demands of various forms of lighting and display, which surges to a remarkable level sufficient for QD laser diodes with a moderate bias (~9 V). Optimized electron injection further enables new types of QD-blend LEDs for diffuse white-light sources surpassing the 2035 R&amp;D targets set by the U.S. Department of Energy. Our findings open a door for understanding and optimizing carrier transport in nanocrystalline semiconductors shared by various types of solution-processed optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of ultrafast singlet fission in 1D rings towards unit efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singlet fission (SF) is an electronic transition that in the last decade has been under the spotlight for its applications in optoelectronics, from photovoltaics to spintronics. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical advancements, optimising SF in extended solids remains a challenge, due to the complexity of its analysis beyond perturbative methods. Here, we tackle the case of 1D rings, aiming to promote singlet fission and prevent its back-reaction. We study ultrafast SF non-perturbatively, by numerically solving a spin-boson model, via exact propagation and tensor network methods. By optimising over a parameter space relevant to organic molecular materials, we identify two classes of solutions that can take SF efficiency beyond 85% in the non-dissipative (coherent) regime, and to 99% when exciton-phonon interactions can be tuned. After discussing the experimental feasibility of the optimised solutions, we conclude by proposing that this approach can be extended to a wider class of optoelectronic optimisation problems.</description>

Abstract: The magneto-optical transport of gapless type-I tilted-single Weyl semimetals exhibits suppression of total magnetoconductivities in the presence of orbital magnetic moment in linear and non-linear responses (Yang Gao et al, Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 105}, 165307 (2022)). In this work, we extend our study to investigate magnetoconductivities in gapless type-I tilted double-Weyl semimetals within the semiclassical Boltzmann approach and show the differences that arise compared to single-Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Integration of through-sapphire substrate machining with superconducting quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate-scale quantum processors. The process allows through-substrate electrical connections, necessary for low-frequency mode-mitigation, as well as signal-routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High-coherence qubits are required to build fault-tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low-loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high-coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium-nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep-silicon etching to create through-substrate-vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small-scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, we present a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high-coherence qubits. This technique immediately provides a means to scale QPUs with integrated mode-mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through-sapphire-vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire-compatible materials for large-scale QPUs.</description>

      <title>Pathway for Unraveling Chemical Composition Effects of Metal-Organic Precursors for FIBID Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of modern metal deposition techniques like Focused Ion/Electron Beam Induced Deposition FIBID/FEBID relies heavily on the availability of metal-organic precursors of particular properties. To create a new precursor, extensive testing under specialized gas injection systems is required along with time-consuming and costly chemical analysis typically conducted using scanning electron microscopes. This process can be quite challenging due to its complexity and expense. Here, we present a method for investigating the chemical composition effects of new metal-organic precursors, prepared in form of supported thick layers, used in FIBID/FEBID applications by utilizing achievable SEM BSE/EDX analysis along with Machine Learning data processing techniques. This approach enables a comprehensive fast examination of decomposition processes during FIBID, providing valuable insights into how these chemical composition effects impact the final properties of metallic deposits. Our method can be employed to optimize, pre-screen, and score new potential precursors for FIBID applications by significantly reducing the time required and conserving valuable resources. Our finding brings also new perspectives across diverse areas of nanoscience in particularly enhancing strongly the field of metal structures nanofabrication.</description>

      <title>Mild-to-wild plasticity of Earth's upper mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flow of Earth's upper mantle has long been considered to occur by slow and near-continuous creep. Such behaviour is observed in classical high-temperature deformation experiments and is a fundamental component of geodynamic models. However, the latest generation of high-resolution experiments, capable of sensing temporal heterogeneities in rates of dislocation motion, have revealed that materials ranging from metals to ice exhibit a spectrum of behaviours termed mild-to-wild plasticity. It remains unknown whether olivine, the most abundant mineral in Earth's upper mantle, always exhibits mild continuous flow or can exhibit intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate. Here, we demonstrate that olivine exhibits measurable wildness, even under conditions at which its behaviour is predicted to be relatively mild. During nanoindentation experiments conducted at room temperature, continuous plastic flow is punctuated by intermittent bursts of displacement with log-normally distrubuted magnitudes, indicating avalanches of correlated dislocation motion that account for approximately 8 +/- 6% of the plastic strain. Remarkably, the framework of mild-to-wild plasticity predicts that wildness should increase with depth in the Earth, with flow of the asthenospheric upper mantle occurring almost entirely by wild fluctuations of deformation at the grain scale. The recognition of intermittent plasticity in geological materials provides new constraints for microphysical models of dislocation-mediated flow and raises questions about the mehcanisms of transient instabilities in otherwise ductile regimes, such as deep earthquakes and slow-slip events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent light-matter interactions mediated by opto-magnetic phenomena like the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) are expected to provide a non-thermal pathway for ultrafast manipulation of magnetism on timescales as short as the excitation pulse itself. As the IFE scales with the spin-orbit coupling strength of the involved electronic states, photo-exciting the strongly spin-orbit coupled core-level electrons in magnetic materials appears as an appealing method to transiently generate large opto-magnetic moments. Here, we investigate this scenario in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy by using intense and circularly polarized pulses of extreme ultraviolet radiation. Our results reveal ultrafast and strong helicity-dependent magnetic effects which are in line with the characteristic fingerprints of an IFE, corroborated by ab initio opto-magnetic IFE theory and atomistic spin dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>3D Topological Semimetal Phases of Strained $\alpha$-Sn on Insulating Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Sn is an elemental topological material, whose topological phases can be tuned by strain and magnetic field. Such tunability offers a substantial potential for topological electronics. However, InSb substrates, commonly used to stabilize $\alpha$-Sn allotrope, suffer from parallel conduction, restricting transport investigations and potential applications. Here, the successful MBE growth of high-quality $\alpha$-Sn layers on insulating, hybrid CdTe/GaAs(001) substrates, with bulk electron mobility approaching 20000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ is reported. The electronic properties of the samples are systematically investigated by independent complementary techniques, enabling thorough characterization of the 3D Dirac (DSM) and Weyl (WSM) semimetal phases induced by the strains and magnetic field, respectively. Magneto-optical experiments, corroborated with band structure modeling, provide an exhaustive description of the bulk states in the DSM phase. The modeled electronic structure is directly observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which reveals linearly dispersing bands near the Fermi level. The first detailed study of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance relates this effect to the chiral anomaly and, consequently, to the presence of WSM. Observation of the $\pi$ Berry phase in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations agrees with the topologically non-trivial nature of the investigated samples. Our findings establish $\alpha$-Sn as an attractive topological material for exploring relativistic physics and future applications.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic ions in the thermal Hall effect of the paramagnetic insulator TmVO$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growing number of materials, phonons have been found to generate a thermal Hall effect, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Inspired by previous studies that revealed the importance of Tb$^{3+}$ ions in generating the thermal Hall effect in a family of pyrochlores, we investigated the role of Tm$^{3+}$ ions in TmVO$_{4}$, a paramagnetic insulator with a different crystal structure. We observe a negative thermal Hall conductivity in TmVO$_{4}$ with a magnitude such that the Hall angle, $|\kappa_{xy}$/$\kappa_{xx}|$, is approximately 1 x 10$^{-3}$ at $H$ = 15 T and $T$ = 20 K, typical for a phonon-generated thermal Hall effect. In contrast to the negligible $\kappa_{xy}$ found in the nonmagnetic pyrochlore analog (where the Tb$^{3+}$ ions are replaced with Y$^{3+}$), we observe a negative $\kappa_{xy}$ in YVO$_{4}$ with a Hall angle of magnitude comparable to that of TmVO$_{4}$. This shows that the Tm$^{3+}$ ions are not essential for the thermal Hall effect in this family of materials. Interestingly, at an intermediate Y concentration of $x$ = 0.3 in Tm$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$VO$_{4}$, $\kappa_{xy}$ was found to have a positive sign, pointing to the importance of impurities in the thermal Hall effect of phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depth resolved study of structural and magnetic profiles of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic (AFM/FM) system upon annealing was performed in this work. We studied systems comprising of AFM IrMn and FM (Co, Fe, Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$) structures using polarized neutron and soft X-ray scattering, secondary neutral spectrometry, and magnetometry. Structural depth profiles obtained from neutron reflectometry indicate non-homogeneity of the AFM layer even before annealing, which is associated with the migration of manganese to the surface of the sample. Annealing of samples with CoFe and Co layers leads to a slight increase ($\sim$ 5 %) in the migration of manganese, which, however, does not lead to significant degradation of the exchange coupling at the AFM/FM interface. A significantly different picture was observed in the Fe/IrMn systems where a strong migration of iron into the AFM layer was observed upon annealing of the sample, leading to erosion of the magnetic profile, the formation of a non-magnetic alloy and degradation of the pinning strength. This study can be useful in the design of AF/FM systems in different spintronics devices, including HDD read heads, where thermal annealing is applied at different stages of the device manufacturing process.</description>

      <title>Voltage-driven 90 switching of bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ferrimagnets</title>

Abstract: Rare earth-transition metal ferrimagnets, featuring antiferromagnetically coupled, inequivalent magnetic sublattices, have garnered increasing interest in the burgeoning field of ferrimagnetic spintronics. However, controlling their magnetism with low voltages,a key to reducing power consumption,remains challenging, particularly due to the poorly understood mechanisms underlying bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Here, we introduce a method involving voltage-driven hydrogen insertion into interstitial sites between Tb and Co atoms, selectively perturbing the atomic structure and enabling ultra-low-voltage (1.2 V) switching of bulk PMA to in-plane directions in ferrimagnetic films. Combining experimental and theoretical analysis, we find that the anisotropy switching originates from the reorientation of Tb orbital moments induced by the distortion of the crystal field. Initially aligned along Tb-Co bonding directions, the easy magnetization axis undergoes reorientation and switches by 90 deg,as substantiated by ab-initio calculations. Our study not only establishes the groundwork for voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy in ferrimagnetic films, facilitating the development of electrically-programmable ferrimagnetic spintronics, but also elucidates the atomic origins of PMA in amorphous ferrimagnets, shedding light on a long-standing question in this field.</description>

      <title>Controlled synthesis and characterization of porous silicon nanoparticles for dynamic nuclear polarization</title>

Abstract: Si nanoparticles (NPs) have been actively developed as a hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agent with an imaging window close to one hour. However, the progress in the development of NPs has been hampered by the incomplete understanding of their structural properties that correspond to efficient hyperpolarization build up and long polarization decays. In this work we study dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of single crystal porous Si (PSi) NPs with defined doping densities ranging from nominally undoped to highly doped with boron or phosphorus. To develop such PSi NPs we perform low-load metal-assisted catalytic etching for electronic grade Si powder followed by thermal oxidation to form the dangling bonds in the Si/SiO$_2$ interface, the $P_b$ centers. $P_b$ centers are the endogenous source of the unpaired electron spins necessary for DNP. The controlled fabrication and oxidation procedures allow us to thoroughly investigate the impact of the magnetic field, temperature and doping on the DNP process. We argue that the buildup and decay rate constants are independent of particle size. Instead, the rates are limited by the polarization transfer across the nuclear spin diffusion barrier determined by the large hyperfine shift of the central $^{29}$Si nuclei of the $P_b$ centers. The size-independent rates then lead to a weak dependence on doping degree for low and moderately doped Si although slight doping is required to achieve the highest polarization. Thus, we find the room temperature relaxation of low boron doped PSi NPs reaching $75 \pm 3$ minutes and nuclear polarization levels exceeding $\sim 6$ % when polarized at 6.7 T and 1.4 K. Our study thus establishes solid grounds for further development of Si NPs.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Relativistic Valence Band Splitting Induced by an Altermagnetic Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) materials exhibit non-relativistic, momentum-dependent spin-split states, ushering in new opportunities for spin electronic devices. While the characteristics of spin-splitting have been documented within the framework of the non-relativistic spin group symmetry, there has been limited exploration of the inclusion of relativistic symmetry and its impact on the emergence of a novel spin-splitting in the band structure. This study delves into the intricate relativistic electronic structure of an AM material, alpha-MnTe. Employing temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy across the AM phase transition, we elucidate the emergence of a relativistic valence band splitting concurrent with the establishment of magnetic order. This discovery is validated through disordered local moment calculations, modeling the influence of magnetic order on the electronic structure and confirming the magnetic origin of the observed splitting. The temperature-dependent splitting is ascribed to the advent of relativistic spin-splitting resulting from the strengthening of AM order in alpha-MnTe as the temperature decreases. This sheds light on a previously unexplored facet of this intriguing material.</description>

      <title>Quasi-van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of {\gamma}'-GaSe Thin Films on GaAs(111)B Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GaSe is an important member of the post-transition metal chalcogenide family and is an emerging two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material. Because it is a van der Waals material, it can be fabricated into atomic-scale ultrathin films, making it suitable for the preparation of compact, heterostructure devices. In addition, GaSe possesses unusual optical and electronic properties, such as a shift from an indirect-bandgap single-layer film to a direct-bandgap bulk material, rare intrinsic p-type conduction, and nonlinear optical behaviors. These properties make GaSe an appealing candidate for the fabrication of field-effect transistors, photodetectors, and photovoltaics. However, the wafer-scale production of pure GaSe single crystal thin films remains challenging. This study develops an approach for the direct growth of nanometer-thick GaSe films on GaAs substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. It yields smooth thin GaSe films with the rare {\gamma}'-polymorph. We analyze the formation mechanism of {\gamma}'-GaSe using density functional theory and speculate that it is stabilized by Ga vacancies since the formation enthalpy of {\gamma}'-GaSe tends to become lower than that of other polymorphs when the Ga vacancy concentration increases. Finally, we investigate the growth conditions of GaSe, providing valuable insights for exploring 2D/3D quasi-van der Waals epitaxial growth.</description>

      <title>Efficient Structure-Informed Featurization and Property Prediction of Ordered, Dilute, and Random Atomic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure-informed materials informatics is a rapidly evolving discipline of materials science relying on the featurization of atomic structures or configurations to construct vector, voxel, graph, graphlet, and other representations useful for machine learning prediction of properties, fingerprinting, and generative design. This work discusses how current featurizers typically perform redundant calculations and how their efficiency could be improved by considering (1) fundamentals of crystallographic (orbits) equivalency to optimize ordered cases and (2) representation-dependent equivalency to optimize cases of dilute, doped, and defect structures with broken symmetry. It also discusses and contrasts ways of (3) approximating random solid solutions occupying arbitrary lattices under such representations. Efficiency improvements discussed in this work were implemented within pySIPFENN or python toolset for Structure-Informed Property and Feature Engineering with Neural Networks developed by authors since 2019 and shown to increase performance from 2 to 10 times for typical inputs. Throughout this work, the authors explicitly discuss how these advances can be applied to different kinds of similar tools in the community.</description>

Abstract: Crystal Orbital Overlap Population (COOP) is one of the effective tools for chemical-bonding analysis, and thus it has been utilized in the materials development and characterization. In this study, we developed a code to perform the COOP-based chemical-bonding analysis based on the wavefunction obtained from a first principles all-electron calculation with numeric atom-centered orbitals. The chemical-bonding analysis using the developed code was demonstrated for F2 and Si. Furthermore, we applied the method to analyze the chemical-bonding changes associated with a Li intercalation in three representative layered materials: graphite, MoS2, and ZrNCl, because of their great industrial importance, particularly for the applications in battery and superconducting materials. The COOP analysis provided some insights for understanding the intercalation mechanism and the stability of the intercalated materials from a chemical-bonding viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Design of Crystal Structures via Diffusion Models with Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the generation of realistic data by training generative models on large datasets of text, images, and audio. While these models have demonstrated exceptional performance in generating novel and plausible data, it remains an open question whether they can effectively accelerate scientific discovery through the data generation and drive significant advancements across various scientific fields. In particular, the discovery of new inorganic materials with promising properties poses a critical challenge, both scientifically and for industrial applications. However, unlike textual or image data, materials, or more specifically crystal structures, consist of multiple types of variables - including lattice vectors, atom positions, and atomic species. This complexity in data give rise to a variety of approaches for representing and generating such data. Consequently, the design choices of generative models for crystal structures remain an open question. In this study, we explore a new type of diffusion model for the generative inverse design of crystal structures, with a backbone based on a Transformer architecture. We demonstrate our models are superior to previous methods in their versatility for generating crystal structures with desired properties. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that the optimal conditioning methods vary depending on the dataset.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torques due to topological insulator surface states: an in-plane magnetization as a probe of extrinsic spin-orbit scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulator (TI) surface states exert strong spin-orbit torques. When the magnetization is in the plane its interaction with the TI conduction electrons is non-trivial, and is influenced by extrinsic spin-orbit scattering. This is expected to be strong in TIs but is difficult to calculate and to measure unambiguously. Here we show that extrinsic spin-orbit scattering sizably renormalizes the surface state spin-orbit torque resulting in a strong density dependence. The magnitude of the renormalization of the spin torque and the effect of spin-orbit scattering on the relative sizes of the in-plane and out-of-plane field-like torques have strong implications for experiment: We propose two separate experimental signatures for the measurement of its presence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 1T-transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have been an exciting platform for exploring the intertwinement of charge density waves and strong correlation phenomena. While the David star structure has been conventionally considered as the underlying charge order in the literature, recent scanning tunneling probe experiments on several monolayer 1T-TMD materials have motivated a new, alternative structure, namely the anion-centered David star structure. In this Letter, we show that this novel anion-centered David star structure manifestly breaks inversion symmetry, resulting in flat bands with pronounced Rashba spin-orbit couplings. These distinctive features unlock novel possibilities and functionalities for 1T-TMDs, including the giant spin Hall effect, the emergence of Chern bands, and spin liquid that spontaneously breaks crystalline rotational symmetry. Our findings establish promising avenues for exploring emerging quantum phenomena of monolayer 1T-TMDs with this novel noncentrosymmetric structure.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability behind brittle fracture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that nucleation of brittle cracks in initially flawless soft elastic solids is preceded by a nonlinear elastic instability, which cannot be captured without accounting for geometrical precise description of finite elastic deformation. As a prototypical problem we consider a homogeneous elastic body subjected to tension and assume that it is weakened by the presence of a free surface which then serves as a site of crack nucleation. We show that in this maximally simplified setting, brittle fracture emerges from a symmetry breaking elastic instability activated by softening and involving large elastic rotations. The implied bifurcation of the homogeneous elastic equilibrium is highly unconventional for nonlinear elasticity as it exhibits an extraordinary sensitivity to geometry, reminiscent of the transition to turbulence in fluids. We trace the post-bifurcational development of this instability beyond the limits of applicability of scale free continuum elasticity and use a phase-field approach to capture the scale dependent sub-continuum strain localization, signaling the formation of actual cracks.</description>

Abstract: Recent reports of room-temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite, commonly referred to as LK99, have prompted numerous theoretical and experimental studies into its properties. As the electron-phonon interaction is a common mechanism for superconductivity, the electron-phonon coupling strength is an important quantity to compute for LK99. In this work, we compare the electron-phonon coupling strength among the proposed compositions of LK99. The results of our study are in alignment with the conclusion that LK99 is not a likely candidate for room-temperature superconductivity if electron-phonon interaction is to serve as the mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have experienced supply shortages and pricing volatility of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected sodium-ion and lithium-ion price trends across over 6,000 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. Assuming substantial progress can be made along technology roadmaps via targeted R&amp;D, we forecast many sodium-ion pathways to be price competitive against low-cost lithium-ion variants in the early 2030s. Additionally, we show timelines are highly sensitive to movements in critical minerals supply chains--namely that of lithium, graphite, and nickel. Modeled outcomes suggest increasing sodium-ion energy densities to decrease materials intensity to be among the most impactful ways to improve competitiveness.</description>

      <title>For sky-facing passive radiative cooling, are wavelength-selective emitters the best choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For passive cooling via thermal radiation toward the sky, it is known that an ideal selective emitter (SE) with high emissivity only in the 8-13 um atmospheric transparency window can reach a lower equilibrium temperature than an ideal broadband emitter (BE) across the mid infrared. Here, we evaluate whether this principle should guide the development of practical passive radiative cooling technologies. We model and compare the cooling performance of sky-facing SEs and BEs at various locations on Earth, accounting for the distributions of atmospheric temperature and gas composition at specific dates and times. We find that for emitter temperatures at or higher than the ambient temperature, an ideal broadband emitter always provides higher net cooling power, while for sub-ambient cooling, an ideal selective emitter is usually slightly better, but the difference in cooling power is small, at most 1-2% of the incident solar power during daytime. Our conclusion is that large-scale deployment of passive radiative cooling technologies should focus on design and manufacturing of scalable low-cost surfaces with the lowest possible solar absorption without worrying too much whether the emitter is broadband or selective.</description>

      <title>A green solvent system for precursor phase-engineered sequential deposition of stable formamidinium lead triiodide for perovskite solar cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer an efficient, inexpensive alternative to current photovoltaic technologies, with the potential for manufacture via high-throughput coating methods. However, challenges for commercial-scale solution-processing of metal-halide perovskites include the use of harmful solvents, the expense of maintaining controlled atmospheric conditions, and the inherent instabilities of PSCs under operation. Here, we address these challenges by introducing a high volatility, low toxicity, biorenewable solvent system to fabricate a range of 2D perovskites, which highly effective precursor phases for subsequent transformation to alpha-formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3), fully processed under ambient conditions. PSCs utilising our FAPbI3 reproducibly show remarkable stability under illumination and elevated temperature (ISOS-L-2) and "damp heat" (ISOS-D-3) stressing, surpassing other state-of-the-art perovskite compositions. We determine that this enhancement is a consequence of the 2D precursor phase crystallisation route, which simultaneously avoids retention of residual low-volatility solvents (such as DMF and DMSO) and reduces the rate of degradation of FA+ in the material. Our findings highlight both the critical role of the initial crystallisation process in determining the operational stability of perovskite materials, and that neat FA+-based perovskites can be competitively stable despite the inherent metastability of the alpha-phase.</description>
