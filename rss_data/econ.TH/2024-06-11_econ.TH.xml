      <title>Learning about informativeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether individuals can learn the informativeness of their information technology through social learning. As in the classic sequential social learning model, rational agents arrive in order and make decisions based on the past actions of others and their private signals. There is uncertainty regarding the informativeness of the common signal-generating process. We show that learning in this setting is not guaranteed, and depends crucially on the relative tail distributions of private beliefs induced by uninformative and informative signals. We identify the phenomenon of perpetual disagreement as the cause of learning and characterize learning in the canonical Gaussian environment.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Interval-Regulated Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study third-degree price discrimination in a model first presented in Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015]. Since such price discrimination might create market segments with vastly different posted prices, we consider regulating these prices, specifically, via restricting them to lie within an interval. Given a price interval, we consider segmentations of the market where a seller, who is oblivious to the existence of such regulation, still posts prices within the price interval. We show the following surprising result: For any market and price interval where such segmentation is feasible, there is always a different segmentation that optimally transfers all excess surplus to the consumers. In addition, we characterize the entire space of buyer and seller surplus that are achievable by such segmentation, including maximizing seller surplus, and simultaneously minimizing buyer and seller surplus.</description>

      <title>Third Degree Price Discrimination Under Costly Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates third-degree price discrimination under endogenous market segmentation. Segmenting a market requires access to information about consumers, and this information comes with a cost. I explore the trade-offs between the benefits of segmentation and the costs of information acquisition, revealing a non-monotonic relationship between consumer surplus and the cost of information acquisition for monopolist. I show that in some markets, allowing the monopolist easier access to customer data can also benefit customers. I also analyzed how social welfare reacts to changes in the cost level of information acquisition and showed that the non-monotonicity result is also valid in social welfare analysis.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making Behavior Evaluation Framework for LLMs under Uncertain Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals often deviate from rational behavior, which can be evaluated across three dimensions: risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion. Given the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in decision-making processes, it is crucial to assess whether their behavior aligns with human norms and ethical expectations or exhibits potential biases. Several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, yet their internal decision-making tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood. This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs. Through a multiple-choice-list experiment, we estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities. However, there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs. We also explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features, uncovering significant disparities. For instance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical disabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more conservative choices. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios. Therefore, this study advocates for developing standards and guidelines to ensure that LLMs operate within ethical boundaries while enhancing their utility in complex decision-making environments.</description>

      <title>Sequentially Optimal Pricing under Informational Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seller sells an object over time but is uncertain how the buyer learns their willingness-to-pay. We consider informational robustness under \textit{limited commitment}, where the seller offers a price \textit{each period} to maximize continuation profit against worst-case information arrival. Our formulation maintains dynamic consistency by considering the worst case \textit{sequentially}. Under general conditions, we characterize an essentially unique equilibrium where the buyer does not delay to learn more later. Furthermore, we identify a condition that ensures the equilibrium price path is ``reinforcing,'' so even dynamically inconsistent information arrival would not lower the seller's payoff below the equilibrium level.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Rank-Collections: Analyzing Expected Strategic Behavior with Uncertain Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game theory relies heavily on the availability of cardinal utility functions, but in fields such as matching markets, only ordinal preferences are typically elicited. The literature focuses on mechanisms with simple dominant strategies, but many real-world applications lack dominant strategies, making the intensity of preferences between outcomes important for determining strategies. Even though precise information about cardinal utilities is not available, some data about the likelihood of utility functions is often accessible. We propose to use Bayesian games to formalize uncertainty about the decision-makers' utilities by viewing them as a collection of normal-form games where uncertainty about types persists throughout all game stages. Instead of searching for the Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we study how uncertainty in utilities is reflected in uncertainty of strategic play. To do this, we introduce a novel solution concept called $\alpha$-Rank-collections, which extends $\alpha$-Rank to Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze strategic play in, for example, non-strategyproof matching markets, for which appropriate solution concepts are currently lacking. $\alpha$-Rank-collections characterize the expected probability of encountering a certain strategy profile under replicator dynamics in the long run, rather than predicting a specific equilibrium strategy profile. We experimentally evaluate $\alpha$-Rank-collections using instances of the Boston mechanism, finding that our solution concept provides more nuanced predictions compared to Bayes-Nash equilibria. Additionally, we prove that $\alpha$-Rank-collections are invariant to positive affine transformations, a standard property for a solution concept, and are efficient to approximate.</description>
