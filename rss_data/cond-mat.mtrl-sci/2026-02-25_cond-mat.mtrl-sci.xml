      <title>OrgFlow: Generative Modeling of Organic Crystal Structures from Molecular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a long-standing challenge in materials science, with most data-driven methods developed for inorganic systems. This leaves an important gap for organic crystals, which are central to pharmaceuticals, polymers, and functional materials, but present unique challenges, such as larger unit cells and strict chemical connectivity. We introduce a flow-matching model for predicting organic crystal structures directly from molecular graphs. The architecture integrates molecular connectivity with periodic boundary conditions while preserving the symmetries of crystalline systems. A bond-aware loss guides the model toward realistic local chemistry by enforcing distributions of bond lengths and connectivity. To support reliable and efficient training, we built a curated dataset of organic crystals, along with a preprocessing pipeline that precomputes bonds and edges, substantially reducing computational overhead during both training and inference. Experiments show that our method achieves a Match Rate more than 10 times higher than existing baselines while requiring fewer sampling steps for inference. These results establish generative modeling as a practical and scalable framework for organic crystal structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Performance Ultra-Wide Bandgap SrSnO$_3$ Top-Gated MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the demonstration of high-performance top-gated metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) based on the ultra-wide bandgap perovskite oxide SrSnO$_3$ (SSO). Using hybrid molecular beam epitaxy-grown SSO channels and ALD-deposited HfO$_2$ gate dielectrics, the devices exhibit field-effect mobility exceeding 65 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s, an on-state current up to 194 mA/mm, an on/off current ratio above $10^8$, and a contact resistance of 0.66 $\Omega\cdot$mm. The devices also show a near-ideal subthreshold slope of 68 mV/dec and negligible hysteresis, indicating a high-quality dielectric/semiconductor interface. These results establish SrSnO$_3$ as a promising ultra-wide bandgap oxide semiconductor platform for high-performance power electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Self-driving thin film laboratory: autonomous epitaxial atomic-layer synthesis via real-time computer vision analysis of electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging materials science platforms with the ability to make autonomous decisions on the fly are fundamentally changing the outlook and protocols for materials optimization and discovery. Because AI-driven self-navigating schemes can effectively reduce the total number of iterations needed to arrive at the "answer" (i.e. the best stochiometric composition for a desired physical property, optimum materials processing parameters, etc.) by significant margins, they have the potential to revolutionize materials and chemical manufacturing processes at large in research laboratory settings as well as in industrial plants. Here, we demonstrate a successful implementation of real-time closed-loop autonomous navigation of a multi-dimensional materials synthesis parameter space for fabricating phase-pure epitaxial films of a metastable phase of a functional oxide in a combinatorial pulsed laser deposition chamber. Sequential epitaxial growth iterations in search of the optimized recipe to stabilize the desired crystal phase were performed using frame-by-frame quantitative computer vision analysis of reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) images of the unit-cell level film being deposited. The autonomous scheme regularly resulted in &gt; 30-fold reduction in the number of required experiments compared to a comprehensive mapping of the parameter space. The real-time workflow developed here can be readily extended to a variety of thin film synthesis platforms opening the door for self-driving atomic-level materials design as well as autonomous optimization of semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Propagation of elastic waves in a flexomagnetic solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexomagnetism is the coupling between magnetism and strain gradients and is a technologically relevant phenomenon. We present a theory of elastic wave propagation in a linear elastic flexomagnetic material with microstructure and strain gradient elastic interactions. The expressions of frequency, phase velocity, and group velocity of longitudinal and transverse waves are derived and are shown to depend on the flexomagnetic coefficient and microstructure. We also show that the effect of flexomagnetism and microstructure can lead to some interesting phenomena in wave propagation, which are not observed in classical linear elasticity theory of waves. Specifically, in contrast to classical linear elastic materials, where wave propagation is non-dispersive, flexomagnetic materials with microstructure can exhibit both normal and abnormal dispersion. It is also noteworthy that, in flexomagnetic materials with gradient elasticity, the phase velocities of transverse waves can exceed those of longitudinal waves, which is atypical in classical elasticity. Furthermore, waves can also attenuate for a certain range of wavenumbers that depend on the flexomagnetic coefficient and microstructural parameters. Finally, we explore the possibility of waves exhibiting zero group velocity modes, where waves are non-propagating but have strong local energy confinement, negative group velocity modes, where the wave packet moves in the opposite direction to that of wave propagation, and the phenomenon of wave freezing, where a propagating wave stops in space without diffusing or spreading.</description>

      <title>Design of Skyrmion Bags with Tunable Topology in Symmetry-Broken 2D Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion bags, as high-order topological swirling spin textures, offer rich fundamental physics and distinct advantages for spintronic applications; however, their realization remains a formidable challenge, especially in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, through model analysis, we propose a novel design principle for engineering skyrmion bags with tunable topology in symmetry-broken 2D ferromagnetic lattices. The physics correlates to the delicate interplay of isotropic exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy, which can stabilize a rich variety of high-order topological spin states as well as the intriguing skyrmionium with zero topological charge. We further validate this mechanism in monolayer CrInTe2 using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin model simulations, revealing the existence of field-free skyrmion bags. Furthermore, we find that a weak magnetic field triggers a transition to skyrmioniums that exhibit remarkable thermal stability up to 240 K. Our results provide a compelling platform for exploring high-order topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Combining Quasiparticle Self-Consistent $GW$ and Machine-Learned DFT+$U$ in Search of Half-Metallic Heuslers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-metallic Heusler compounds are of significant interest for spintronics. For device fabrication, compounds that can be epitaxially grown on III-V semiconductors are particularly attractive. We present a first-principles investigation of four Co-based and two Ni-based Heusler compounds that are lattice-matched to InAs. The results of density functional theory (DFT) using semi-local and hybrid functionals are compared to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QPGW). We also consider DFT with machine-learned Hubbard $U$ corrections [npj Computational Materials 6, 180 (2020)] with a new Bayesian optimization (BO) objective function to determine the $U$ values that yield the closest agreement with the QPGW band structure and magnetic moments. We find that DFT+U(BO) can adequately reproduce the key QPGW features in most cases. Our results reveal a strong method dependence of the degree of spin polarization at the Fermi level and, in some cases, even the dominant spin channel (majority or minority). Of the materials studied here, Co$_2$TiSn and Co$_2$ZrAl are the most likely to be half-metals, and Co$_2$MnIn is likely to be a near-half-metal.</description>

      <title>Large Photoelasticity in Topological Antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn Studied by Coherent Acoustic Phonon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relation of electronic and optical properties to ultrafast strain in topological antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn thin films using near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses. Coherent acoustic phonon oscillations are generated and clearly identified with a remarkably large amplitude exceeding 1% in differential transmission. Quantitative analysis reveals that near-infrared photoelastic coefficient in Mn$_3$Sn is several times larger than that in typical materials. These results establish a quantitative approach for understanding the large optical responses to ultrafast strain in the topological kagome antiferromagnet, suggesting potential opto-spintronic and optoacoustic applications even at telecommunications wavelength.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the dynamics of transient spin and orbital magnetization in SrTiO$_3$ via the inverse Faraday effect from RT-TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction allows to achieve non-equilibrium states that are otherwise inaccessible. Motivated by recent experiments that report ferroelectricity -- and even multiferroicity -- in the prototypical diamagnetic band insulator SrTiO$_3$ induced by terahertz pulses, we investigate the carrier and magnetization dynamics of SrTiO$_3$ excited optically by linearly and circularly polarized light. Our real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (RT-TDDFT) results reveal a highly non-trivial, site- and orbital-dependent temporal evolution with charge transferred from O $2p$ to Ti $3d$ states. For linearly polarized light the orbitally polarized lobes of electron density at the oxygen and titanium sites fluctuate out-of-phase, resembling the soft transverse optical phonon mode, dynamically breaking inversion symmetry. In contrast, circularly polarized pulses induce a coherent rotation of the charge dipoles around O. This induces a helicity-dependent finite transient magnetization with opposite sign for oxygen and Ti even without ionic motion. Detailed analysis reveals that the dominant mechanism is the transfer of angular momentum of light to the electronic orbital angular momentum, while spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in the transfer from orbital to spin angular momentum, the former being an order of magnitude larger than the latter.</description>

      <title>Phonon frequency comb close to an isolated Einstein mode in InSiTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of phonon frequency combs exemplifies a rare and intriguing phenomenon in quantum solids. Materials with distinctive phonon band structures are especially promising for hosting such states, as their vibrational dispersion landscape across the Brillouin zone can facilitate the formation of long-lived, collective lattice excitations. In the layered Van der Waals compound InSiTe$_3$, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy reveals a pronounced anharmonicity in symmetry-predicted modes and the formation of a self-organized frequency domain structure (coherent-like state), in the range of a localized highenergy A$_{1g}$ phonon mode near 500 cm$^{-1}$. This strong phonon-phonon coupling manifests itself as an anomalous temperature dependence around 200 K, coinciding with the appearance of higher-order excitations within the phonon density of states gap. These findings position InSiTe$_3$ as an unconventional platform where intrinsic highly structured phonon spectral correlations and unusually strong anharmonic effects coexist, opening new avenues for exploring emergent vibrational phenomena in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point-like Defects in Bulk Semiconductors: Junction Spectroscopy Techniques for Perovskite Solar Cells and 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Junction spectroscopy techniques (JSTs) are powerful tools for investigating electrically active defects in semiconductors. Originally developed to study point-like defects in bulk semiconductors, JSTs have since been extended to increasingly complex systems, providing valuable insights into defect energetics and interactions. This review paper outlines the fundamental principles of JSTs and critically examines their application to emerging materials, such as perovskite solar cells and two-dimensional (2D) materials. By highlighting both the capabilities and limitations of JSTs in these non-classical systems, the review demonstrates their continued relevance and important role in advancing next-generation semiconductor materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Modeling of Temperature-Dependent Optoelectronic Properties of Anharmonic Solid Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging strong optoelectronic responses to external stimuli, such as temperature and electric fields, is central to the development of advanced photonic technologies, including adaptive photodetectors and reconfigurable photovoltaic devices. However, only a limited number of semiconducting materials, typically characterized by strong electron-phonon coupling, are known to exhibit such pronounced responsiveness, and their equilibrium optoelectronic properties are often not optimally suited for targeted applications. Chemical engineering strategies, such as doping and solid-solution mixing, are therefore widely employed to fine-tune the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors. Predicting the impact of such modifications, however, remains highly challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of chemically disordered and anharmonic systems, as well as the computational limitations of conventional first-principles approaches. In this work, we introduce a new computational framework that combines ab initio electronic-structure methods with machine-learning techniques to achieve first-principles precision in the prediction of optoelectronic properties of anharmonic solid solutions at finite temperature. We apply this approach to silver chalco-halide solid solutions, an emergent class of optoelectronic materials that have been experimentally shown to exhibit large band-gap tunability and strong responses to thermal excitations. Our results provide quantitative insight into the interplay between chemical disorder, lattice dynamics, and electronic structure in these materials. More broadly, this study establishes a general strategy for the accurate modeling of optoelectronic functionality in chemically disordered semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Films as Model Platform for Understanding Compositionally Complex Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionally complex solid solutions provide a unique route for engineering high-performance electrocatalysts, where the polyelemental surface composition can be seamlessly tuned to optimize activity, selectivity, and stability. However, the mechanistic understanding of these electrocatalysts remains limited by the lack of a model system with a crystallographically-defined surface that is compatible with correlative, multi-scale characterization. Here, we present epitaxial films as a model platform for studying compositionally complex electrocatalysts. Using magnetron sputtering, we realize (111) epitaxial Ir-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru films on (0001) sapphire substrate via a (111) Pt buffer layer, confirmed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The growth approach is applicable across a broad composition range and produces smooth surfaces (root mean square roughness &lt; 1 nm) with micrometer-sized grains in the nanoscale films. With these films, we demonstrate direct structure-activity mapping at the nanoscale through precise co-localization using micro-indents and performing correlative atomic force microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. Our work establishes a model platform for fundamental scalebridging characterization and paves the way for rational design of compositionally complex electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Collective Phonon Mixing and Eigenvector Transport Under Isotope Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic substitution modifies nuclear masses without altering the electronic potential energy surface to first order and is therefore often interpreted as a simple rescaling of vibrational frequencies. In solids with dense phonon manifolds, however, mass substitution acts as a parametric Hermitian deformation of the mass-weighted dynamical matrix, generating a continuous family of eigenproblems whose eigenvectors can undergo substantial rotation within coupled subspaces. Here we investigate protiated and deuterated ZIF-8 using inelastic neutron scattering and density functional theory lattice-dynamics calculations. While many vibrational modes exhibit near-ideal mass scaling and preserve their character across isotopic endpoints, modes embedded in spectrally congested regions display pronounced redistribution of vibrational character that cannot be inferred from frequency shifts alone. Because inelastic neutron scattering intensity is directly weighted by hydrogen displacement amplitude, spectral sparsity and congestion provide experimental indicators of predictable frequency renormalisation or susceptibility to qualitative eigenvector reorganisation under deuteration. To establish physically meaningful mode correspondence, we develop an adiabatic eigenvector-continuation framework with overlap-based tracking and explicit stability diagnostics. These results show that vibrational identity in complex framework materials is best understood as a continuous trajectory in eigenvector space and provide a general framework for analysing isotope-induced spectral flow in dense phonon systems.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism above 200 K in organic-ion intercalated CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrSBr is a van der Waals magnetic semiconductor exhibiting antiferromagnetic order below 140 K. It has emerged as a promising platform for engineering 2D magnetism because its intertwined electronic, optical, and magnetic properties can be profoundly modified via external stimuli such as electrical gating or magnetic fields. However, other strategies for tuning magnetism in layered materials, such as molecular intercalation, remain largely unexplored for CrSBr. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of tetramethylammonium (TMA) and tetrapropylammonium (TPA) ions into CrSBr induces a transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order, while significantly enhancing the magnetic transition temperature to 190 K (TMA) and 230 K (TPA). The resulting intercalates are air-stable and exhibit large, hysteretic magnetoresistance exceeding 60% at 50 K in the TPA case. Besides, intercalation introduces symmetry-breaking structural changes in each CrSBr plane, revealed by Raman microscopy and corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These findings highlight molecular intercalation as a powerful and versatile route to tailor the magnetic properties of CrSBr and unlock its potential to fabricate robust, high-temperature 2D magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>A One-Dimensional Reduction Method for Calculating Thermal Expansion in Solids: Application to Orthorhombic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic thermal expansion plays a critical role in the performance and reliability of functional materials, yet its theoretical description remains limited. Here, a computational framework that reduces the calculation of thermal expansion in solids to an effective one-dimensional problem is presented and applied to orthorhombic lattice. Using this method, a comprehensive set of thermodynamic and mechanical properties is determined.</description>

      <title>Determining Atomic Structure from Spectroscopy via an Active Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining atomic structure from spectroscopic data is central to materials science but remains restricted to a limited set of techniques and material classes, largely due to the computational cost and complexity of structural refinement. Here we introduce ActiveStructOpt, a general framework that integrates graph neural network surrogate models with active learning to efficiently determine candidate structures that reproduce target spectra with minimal computational expenditure. Benchmarking with X-ray pair distribution function data, and with the more computationally demanding simulations of X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), demonstrate that ActiveStructOpt reliably determines structures that match closely in spectra across diverse materials classes. Under equivalent computational budgets, ActiveStructOpt outperforms existing structure determination methods. By enabling data-efficient, multi-objective structural refinement across a broad range of computable spectroscopic techniques, ActiveStructOpt provides a flexible and extensible approach to atomic structure determination in complex materials.</description>

      <title>Engineering of SnO2-Graphene Oxide Nano-Heterojunctions for Selective Room-temperature Chemical Sensing and Optoelectronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-performing sensing materials, able to detect ppb-trace concentrations of volatile organic compounds at low temperatures, is required for the development of next-generation miniaturized wireless sensors. Here, we present the engineering of selective room-temperature chemical sensors, comprising highly porous tin dioxide (SnO2) - graphene oxide (GO) nano-heterojunction layouts. The optoelectronic and chemical properties of these highly porous (above 90%) p-n heterojunctions were systematically investigated in terms of composition and morphologies. Optimized SnO2-GO layouts demonstrate significant potential as both visible-blind photodetectors and as selective room-temperature chemical sensors. Notably, a low GO content results in an excellent UV light responsivity (400A x W-1), with short rise and decay times, and room-temperature high chemical sensitivity with selective detection of volatile organic compounds such as ethanol down to 100~ppb. In contrast, a high concentration of GO drastically decreases the room-temperature response to ethanol and results in good selectivity to ethylbenzene. The feasibility of tuning the chemical selectivity of the sensor response by engineering the relative amount of GO and SnO2 is a promising feature that may guide the future development of miniaturized solid-state gas sensors. Furthermore, the excellent optoelectronic properties of these SnO2-GO nano-heterojunctions may find applications in various other areas such as optoelectronic devices and (photo)electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Symmetr: a Python package for determining symmetry properties of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed matter compounds typically form crystals, which break the rotational and translational invariance of space but remain invariant under a discrete set of symmetry operations. Understanding the effects allowed by this symmetry breaking, as well as the constraints imposed by the crystal structure, is a crucial problem in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a Python package for determining the symmetry-restricted forms of tensors describing physical properties of crystals, focusing particularly on magnetic materials. The primary focus is on response tensors; however, the program can also describe equilibrium properties and other physical properties, such as magnetic interactions. The program can describe the symmetry using the conventional magnetic space groups, as well as using the spin groups that describe the non-relativistic limit. Additional functionality includes the treatment of quantities projected onto a particular site and expansions in the magnetic order parameter. The code can be used either from the command line or via a Python API.</description>

      <title>Rapid Primary Radiation Damage Resistance Assessment of Precipitation-Hardened Cu Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a direct correlation between in situ irradiation-induced property changes measured by transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) and the resulting microstructural damage in Cu-Cr-Ta alloys. Thin films fabricated by physical vapor deposition were irradiated with 6.6 MeV Cu +3 ions up to 25 DPA, while TGS continuously monitored the evolution of surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency and thermal diffusivity. Post-irradiation transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to quantify void formation as a metric of accumulated radiation damage. A pronounced decrease in SAW frequency was observed some seconds after the onset of irradiation, and it was found to correlate strongly with the final void density. Vacancy MEB calculations propose that the small decrease in SAW frequency is associated with the low population of mobile vacancies, promoting defect recombination and decreasing void formation. This relationship enables early prediction of relative radiation damage resistance within minutes of irradiation, substantially reducing the time required compared to conventional irradiation and postcharacterization routes, allowing rapid screening of multiple compositions. We were able to test this method with 3 compositions of the Cu-Cr-Ta system. More generally, this in situ approach provides an efficient pathway for accelerating the development of materials for radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Anomalous temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu) single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of strong disorder can significantly impact electrical conduction in metallic systems. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, $\rho(T)$, in nonmagnetic single crystals of the Remeika-phase cage compounds R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu). Contrary to the density of states (DOS) calculations in the literature, the experimentally measured $\rho(T)$ in both compounds exhibits semiconducting-like behavior, which we attribute to the strong structural disorder due to its unique crystal structure and low carrier-density. A detailed analysis of the electrical resistivity data reveals that neither the Arrhenius thermal activation law nor variable-range hopping (VRH) models can adequately describe their temperature dependence over the broad temperature range of 2-350 K. However, a model incorporating parallel conduction through both semiconducting and metallic channels provides an adequate explanation. In addition to a dominant metallic conduction below $\sim 10$~K, a negative temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity ($d\rho/dT$) is found in both samples. In the absence of magnetic impurities, the observed $d\rho/dT &lt; 0$ is interpreted in terms of the structural Kondo mechanism.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry breaking on altermagnetism in CrSb and Formation of fragmented nodal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenomena concerning altermagnets have opened up a window for unconventional analysis of the momentum space spin polarization (MSSP) of antiferromagnetic materials. Taking the example of one of the widely investigated altermagnets, CrSb, we explore the underlying mechanisms leading to the formation or breaking of altermagnetism. With the aid of DFT calculation and symmetry analysis, we study the behavior of MSSP in the altermagnetic bands of pristine CrSb, along with a few model structures designed from the pristine one by hypothetical vacancy engineering and interstitial doping. We show that the six-fold rotational symmetry of the pristine CrSb can be reduced to a two-fold rotational symmetry via vacancy and doping engineering. We discover the formation of fragmented nodal curves (FNCs) across the Brillouin zone when in an altermagnetic material when the symmetry is restricted to two-fold rotation. Unlike the typical nodal planes and axes, the location of the FNCs in the momentum space is found to be band-specific. The formation of FNCs is further validated by introducing uniaxial strain to CrSb and by examining the band structure of RbMnPO$_4$, as they both exhibit a two-fold rotational symmetry responsible for altermagnetism. We observe that, unlike the pristine case, these FNCs have the potential to manifest anomalous Hall conductivities (AHC), while the N\'eel vector orients along both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. This flexibility of the AHC will pave the way for the application of altermagnets in the futuristic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Graded anisotropic metamaterials for elastic wave mode conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient transmission of elastic waves across interfaces is central to several applications, including medical imaging, seismic isolation, and transducer design. Interfaces with abrupt changes in the material properties significantly impede wave transmission, leading to reflections. This limitation, known as impedance mismatch, becomes even more prominent for mode conversion between different wave types due to polarization mismatch. In this study, we investigate a mechanism employing two-dimensional functionally graded anisotropic metamaterials to facilitate longitudinal--shear mode conversion as waves propagate from a stiff to a compliant medium. By embedding density and anisotropic shape gradients within the functionally graded metamaterial, polarization-induced impedance mismatch is mitigated and efficient mode conversion is enabled. We use unit cell dispersion analysis to tailor the frequency range for mode conversion through gradation in the dispersion behavior and coupling between modes. Using frequency-domain finite element analysis, we demonstrate broadband mode conversion across interfaces with large stiffness contrast operating in the 1--10 kHz range. We then experimentally validate and quantify mode conversion through full-field velocity measurements on an additively manufactured specimen. We further apply the methodology to design a device capable of converting radial--tangential wave modes.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-enabled inverse design of bimaterial thermoelastic lattice metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermoelastic metamaterial based on a bimaterial hybrid-honeycomb structure, exhibiting simultaneously negative Poisson's ratios and negative thermal expansion coefficients is very promising for various application. This work is dedicated to the machine learning (ML)-enabled inverse design of such structure, on the basis of high-throughput simulation and neural network models. A large dataset is generated through computational homogenization of structures with varying geometrical features and base material properties. A forward ML model is first trained to efficiently and accurately predict the effective thermoelastic properties for a given structure design. Subsequently, inverse ML models are developed to suggest geometrical features and base materials for desired target properties. To address various inverse design scenarios, six different models are proposed, each defined by different combinations of target effective properties and structural design variables. The trained forward model is integrated into the loss functions of the inverse models and is also employed to generate additional datasets for cases with fixed base materials. The good predictive performance of the forward and inverse ML models is demonstrated by representative design examples. These ML models can be applied to efficiently solving specific inverse design tasks involved in the practical application of the thermoelastic metamaterial in novel engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic spin textures: Emergent electrodynamics, quantum geometry, and probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent electrodynamics arising from spatially and temporally varying magnetic textures provides a framework for spin control in quantum materials. While this principle is established for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic textures, its consequences for altermagnets -- magnetic orders with vanishing net magnetization but finite spin splitting -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an effective low-energy theory of itinerant electrons coupled to smoothly varying altermagnetic spin textures. In the adiabatic regime, we show that altermagnetic textures generate additional emergent electromagnetic fields and quantum-geometric effects that are absent in conventional magnetic systems. These effects include emergent Zeeman fields that encode the structure of the altermagnetic order parameter, enabling local spin manipulation and a way to distinguish different altermagnetic orders. Moreover, we demonstrate a quantum-metric-induced, spin-dependent electron lensing effect that provides a mechanism for spin filtering, and discuss the local admixture of effective odd-parity magnetic components. Our results suggest that textured altermagnets could serve as a versatile resource for spintronics functionalities and a probe of altermagnetism.</description>

Abstract: Plastic waste, being one of the most important problems for humankind, poses severe threats to ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. Tracing, quantifying, and identifying types of plastic waste is of crucial importance to understand its environmental pathways and develop targeted strategies for reduction, recycling, and remediation. To contribute to addressing this global issue, we investigated the spin-labeling capabilities of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO$_2$) radicals upon introduction into poly(ethylene terephthalate) and utilized electron spin resonance spectroscopy for detection. The technique is capable of identifying plastic species as the unpaired electron of the radical molecule is strongly sensitive to its local environment through its coupling parameters. Temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the molecules are immobilized at low temperatures and exhibit well-resolved anisotropic and hyperfine spectra that are quantitatively described by a model spin Hamiltonian. Even above the melting point of water, some degrees of freedom remain blocked as a result of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, employing a time-series measurement at room temperature enabled us to determine the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the polymer.</description>

      <title>Electronic dynamics in long linear and cyclic polyynes towards the carbyne limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbyne-the one-dimensional sp-hybridised allotrope of carbon-has long been predicted to exhibit unique properties, yet its synthesis remains elusive. To probe its behaviour, finite sp-carbon chains such as cumulenes and polyynes have been studied, but work to date has focused almost exclusively on short, linear systems far from the infinite carbyne limit and without considering topology. Here, we investigate long (48-carbon) linear and cyclic polyynes using steady-state and ultrafast, temperature- and polarization-resolved optical and vibrational spectroscopy. We find highly delocalized ground states in both topologies, with Peierls distortions markedly weaker than in short chains. In contrast, excited states undergo rapid self-localisation, with the localisation pathway and subsequent intersystem crossing strongly dependent on chain length and topology. Unlike shorter polyynes, excited-state structural rearrangements are minimal, and comparison with theoretical predictions shows that properties, such as Huang-Rhys factors, have plateaued by 48 carbons. Our results reveal how topology influences the electronic dynamics of long polyynes and refines our understanding of sp-carbon systems approaching the carbyne limit</description>

      <title>Autonomous Laboratory Agent via Customized Domain-Specific Language Model and Modular AI Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a system architecture that addresses a fundamental challenge in deploying language-model agents for autonomous control of scientific instrumentation: ensuring reliability in safety-critical environments. The framework integrates probabilistic reasoning by domain-specialized language models with deterministic execution layers that enforce constraints through structured validation and modular orchestration. By separating intent interpretation, experimental planning, and command verification, the architecture translates high-level scientific goals into verifiable experimental actions. We demonstrate this approach in real-time atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy experiments operated at room temperature, where the system autonomously generates control strategies, invokes corrective modules, and maintains stable operation under experimentally challenging conditions. Quantitative evaluations show that domain-adapted small language models achieve high routing robustness and command accuracy while operating on consumer-grade hardware. Beyond a specific instrument, the framework establishes a general computational principle for deploying language-model agents in safety-critical experimental workflows, providing a pathway toward scalable autonomous laboratories.</description>

      <title>Efficient two-color Floquet control of the RKKY interaction in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in real materials can mask the intrinsic spin-dependent properties of hosts. They interact indirectly through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, which limits the use of isolated impurity spins in applications such as qubits and spintronics. Suppressing the RKKY interaction would therefore enable access to the host's unperturbed behavior while simultaneously isolating impurity spins for functional use. Although single-color laser driving can suppress the RKKY interaction, it typically requires strong fields that may be impractical or destabilizing. To overcome these limitations, we show that two-color laser driving provides efficient and tunable control over all components of the RKKY interaction using two weak laser fields. Focusing on two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, we show that interference between one- and two-photon processes produces altermagnet-specific Floquet corrections. These include additional AC Stark shifts, magnetizations, spin-orbit renormalization, and emergent in-plane Zeeman fields that are absent under single-color driving and in non-altermagnetic systems. Notably, two-color driving induces a finite $z$-component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, stabilizing in-plane chiral magnetism and related textures in Rashba altermagnets. These effects enable tunable, near-complete on-off switching of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interactions through a Lifshitz-like modulation of the Fermi surface. We also show that the tuning process is highly sensitive to the chirality of both beams. We further map phase diagrams for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic impurity alignment with clockwise and counterclockwise canting as functions of Rashba coupling and altermagnetic order. Finally, we discuss candidate material platforms and experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Observation of sequential quantum oscillations induced by mini-Landau bands in a three-dimensional Dirac semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum oscillations, the oscillatory behavior of electrical and thermodynamic properties, are typically observed in metals and vanish in the quantum limit under strong magnetic fields1. Phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect2, the Hofstadter butterfly3,4, and recent observations of quantum oscillations in exotic insulators are notable exceptions5-12. The narrow-gap Dirac semiconductor ZrTe5, a less exotic material without strong correlations or artificially engineered superlattices, nevertheless exhibits resistance oscillations in the quantum limit13 but can be interpreted within a simple Zeeman-effect-based picture14,15, which remains conventional quantum oscillations without exotic properties. Here, we report the observation of unexpected mini-oscillations superimposed on Zeeman-effect-induced main oscillations in the quantum limit. The subtracted mini-oscillations are periodic in 1/B with the highest frequency equal to 2.1% of the first Brillouin zone and have extremely heavy effective mass ~ 2me, which is unexpected in ZrTe5 given its ultralow carrier density. Additionally, the mini-oscillations exhibit sequential features that are synchronized with the main oscillations, suggesting an internal structure of the Landau bands. However, they appear incompatible with the Hofstadter butterfly due to the highly anisotropic/three-dimensional crystal structure. These sequential mini-oscillations correlate with the commensurability resonance effect with subunity fractions observed in angular magnetoresistance, relating to the formation of mini-Landau bands. Our results present solid experimental evidence of exotic quantum oscillations in the quantum limit beyond currently available mechanisms, and establish ZrTe5, a prototypical Dirac semiconductor, as a simple platform parallel to correlated insulators for exploring exotic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Three-Dimensionally Interconnected Hexagonal Boron Nitride Networked Cu-Ni Composite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.15392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-dimensionally interconnected hexagonal boron nitride (3Di-hBN) networked Cu-Ni (3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni) composite was successfully synthesized in situ using a simple two-step process which involved the compaction of mixed Cu-Ni powders (70 wt.% Cu and 30 wt.% Ni) into a disc followed by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process at 1000{\deg}C. During MOCVD, the Cu-Ni alloy grains acted as a template for the growth of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) while decaborane and ammonia were used as precursors for boron and nitrogen, respectively. Boron and nitrogen atoms diffused into the Cu-Ni solution during the MOCVD process, precipitated out and grew along the Cu-Ni interfaces upon cooling. It was demonstrated that pores were generated during the sintering process and then filled by bulk hBN during the MOCVD process (indicated by energy dispersive spectroscopy) as the pores also served as catalytic sites for the nucleation and growth of hBN. Optical microscopy examination indicated that there was a minimum amount of bulk hBN at certain compaction pressure (280 MPa) and sintering time (30 min). Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the interconnected network of hBN layers surrounding the Cu-Ni grains was developed in the 3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni composite. This 3Di-hBN network is expected to enhance the resistance of the 3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni composite against mechanical, thermal and chemical attacks. Moreover, foam-like 3Di-hBN was extracted from 3Di-hBN-Cu-Ni composite which could be further applied in the fields of biomedicine and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Dewetting of Polycrystalline Thin Films: a Phase Field Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state dewetting is the process by which thin solid films break up and retract on a substrate, forming nanostructures. While dewetting of single-crystalline films is understood as a surface-energy-driven process mediated by surface diffusion, polycrystalline films exhibit additional complexity due to the presence of grain boundaries. Most theoretical and computational studies have focused on single-crystalline dewetting. Here, we present the application of the grandpotential multi-phase-field model to the dewetting of thin polycrystalline films in three dimensions, reproducing the key phenomenology of this process. By considering isotropic interface/surface energy, we illustrate its consistency with predictions based on energetic arguments and the morphological evolution towards equilibrium. We also provide novel analytical criteria for the onset of three-dimensional dewetting, serving as fundamental theoretical benchmarks, and highlight the critical role of triple junctions. Moreover, we unveil the dewetting behavior of polycrystalline patches, extending the scenarios of their single-crystalline counterparts.</description>

      <title>Disconnection formation via segregation-induced grain boundary phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disconnections, long recognized as the key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystalline materials, have traditionally been understood to nucleate through thermal or mechanical activation. In this work, using atomistic simulations, we reveal a distinct nucleation mechanism driven exclusively by solute interstitial segregation across multiple substitutional binary alloy systems (e.g., Al-Ni, Al-Fe). This process exhibits zero-nucleation energy barriers, contrasting sharply with the nucleation mechanisms in pure systems. We identify states that are activated through segregation-induced GB phase transitions: (i) isolated disconnections or phase junctions that promote GB migration and disappear with continuous segregation, and (ii) composite disconnections that are formed via two oppositely oriented isolated disconnections. The disconnections are mechanically robust, suppressing shear-coupled migration and instead resulting in GB amorphization and pure sliding under applied shear loading. The long-range stress fields associated with these composite disconnections further attract solute atoms and assist the nucleation of precipitates. These disconnections, absent in pure materials, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed through dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across different alloy chemistries and crystal structures. Our findings demonstrate that solute interstitial segregation provides a powerful and previously unrecognized pathway for barrier-free disconnection formation, thereby fundamentally extending current understanding of GB kinetics in alloy systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Prediction of Ionic Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolytes with Machine Learning and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are attractive for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to improved safety and stability but their low room-temperature ionic conductivity hinders practical application. Experimental synthesis and testing of new SSEs remain time-consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning (ML) offers an accelerated route for SSE discovery; however, composition-only models neglect structural factors important for ion transport while graph neural networks (GNNs) are challenged by the scarcity of structure-labeled conductivity data and the prevalence of crystallographic disorder in CIFs. Here, we train two complementary predictors on the same room-temperature, structure-labeled dataset (n = 499). A gradient-boosted tree regressor (GBR) combining stoichiometric and geometric descriptors achieves best performance (MAE = 0.543 in log(S cm-1)), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identifies probe-occupiable volume (POAV) and lattice parameters as key correlations for conductivity. In parallel, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using compact text prompts derived from CIF metadata (formula with optional symmetry and disorder tags), avoiding direct use of raw atomic coordinates. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves high accuracy (MAE = 0.657 in log(S cm-1)) using formula and symmetry information, eliminating the need for numerical feature extraction from CIF files. Together, these results show that global geometric descriptors improve tree-based predictions and enable interpretable structure-property analysis, while LLMs provide a competitive low-preprocessing alternative for rapid SSE screening.</description>

      <title>Complex Magnetic Behavior in RuO$_2$ Thin Films Driven by Strain and Substrate Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been proposed as a prototypical metallic $d$-wave altermagnet, a N\'eel-ordered compensated antiferromagnetic state exhibiting nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting; yet, its magnetic ground state remains controversial both theoretically and experimentally. Using comprehensive first-principles calculations, we investigate RuO$_2$ thin films with (110), (100), and (001) orientations, both (un)strained freestanding and supported on a TiO$_2$ substrate. We show that emergent magnetic moments in RuO$_2$ thin films are highly fragile, strongly influenced by strain, surface orientation, and atomic relaxation, while also being highly sensitive to the choice of the Brillouin-zone integration scheme. We find that none of the thin film structures considered can stabilize a compensated antiferromagnetic order; therefore, an altermagnetic ground state cannot be realized. Instead, substrate-supported RuO$_2$ films on TiO$_2$ exhibit pronounced layer- and site-dependent magnetic moment variations and incomplete compensation between the two antiferromagnetically coupled Ru moments, yielding a \emph{ferrimagnetic-like} behavior. On the other hand, freestanding RuO$_2$ films display complex magnetic structures depending on their orientation and applied strain, with distinct behavior at the surfaces and in the inner layers. Our results reconcile conflicting theoretical and experimental reports and underscore the sensitivity of RuO$_2$ magnetism to structural and methodological details.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Structure Refinement of X-ray Diffraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence can rapidly propose candidate phases and structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), but these hypotheses often fail in downstream refinement because peak intensities cannot be stably assigned under severe overlap and diffraction consistency is enforced only weakly. Here we introduce the whole-pattern expectation--maximization (WPEM) algorithm, a physics-constrained whole-pattern decomposition and refinement workflow that turns Bragg's law into an explicit constraint within a batch expectation--maximization framework. WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (PbSO$_4$ and Tb$_2$BaCoO$_5$), where it yields lower $R_p/R_{wp}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions. We further demonstrate generality across realistic experimental scenarios, including phase-resolved decomposition in multiphase materials, quantitative recovery of mixture compositions, separation of crystalline peaks from amorphous backgrounds in semicrystalline systems, high-throughput operando lattice tracking, automated refinement of compositionally disordered solid solutions, and quantitative phase-resolved analysis of complex archaeological samples from synchrotron powder XRD. By providing Bragg-consistent, uncertainty-aware intensity partitioning as a refinement-ready interface, WPEM closes the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-admissible structure refinement on challenging XRD data.</description>

      <title>Electron-electrolyte coupling in AC transport through nanofluidic channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport properties of nanofluidic channels are usually studied under constant (DC) voltage or pressure driving. However, the frequency response under sinusoidal (AC) drivings offers rich insights into the time-dependent transport mechanisms. Inspired by recent electrochemical approaches, we investigate the couplings between ionic and electronic transport under AC driving. We show that conduction electrons of the channel walls participate in ionic current via capacitive electrochemical coupling, defining a critical frequency and length scale where electron-dominated conductivity emerges. We further analyze how electron-ion coupling modifies electro-osmotic flows, and demonstrate that fluctuation-induced momentum transfer between the electrolyte and wall electrons produces distinct AC transport signatures depending on the charge carrier polarity. Altogether, we establish a frequency-dependent transport matrix that couples ionic, electronic and hydrodynamic flows. These findings establish AC nanofluidic transport as a powerful probe of interfacial phenomena under confinement, and suggest new directions for engineering nanofluidic functionalities through electron-electrolyte coupling.</description>

      <title>Electronic localization and optical activity of strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles are promising platforms for quantum emission, as revealed by recent experimental observations. In this work, we present an \textit{ab initio} investigation of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ nanobubbles, linking their structural and electronic properties to predictions of their optical activity. Inflating forces yield tunable geometries with non-uniform, apex-concentrated strain, which is sensitive to material rigidity. Strain modifies band gaps and universally induces non-dispersive valence states, exhibiting composition-dependent wave-function character, as revealed by an in-depth analysis of band structures and orbital contributions. Crucially, transitions from these apex-localized valence states are predominantly dark. This characteristic is attributed to their localization at the $\Gamma$-point, inhibiting transitions to the lowest unoccupied states that reside at the K-valley. While revealing that the herein considered sub-10-nm nanobubbles fall short as single-photon emitters, our findings provide essential understanding of the structure-property relations in emerging quantum materials, providing robust design rules to optimize their characteristics for novel quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Excitons and Optical Response in Excitonic Insulator Candidate TiSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the charge density wave (CDW) phase in TiSe$_2$ is a highly debated topic, with lattice and excitonic correlations proposed as the main driving mechanisms. One of the proposed scenarios is the excitonic insulator (EI) mechanism, where soft electronic mode drives the phase transition. However, the existence of this purely electronic mode is controversial. Here, we perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in TiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter equations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is dominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic modes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the structural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$ states, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in the optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV. Close to the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$, these two excitonic modes are softened and approach zero energy. These results suggest that the EI mechanism is not a main driving force in the formation of the CDW phase in TiSe$_2$, but there is a region in the phase diagram near $T_{\rm CDW}$ where EI fluctuations could be relevant.</description>

Abstract: We present an infrared spectroscopy study of the layered topological semimetal TaNiTe$_5$, a material with a quasi-one-dimensional structure and strong in-plane anisotropy. Despite its structural features, infrared reflectivity and electronic transport measurements along the $a$ and $c$ crystallographic axes show metallic behavior without evidence of reduced dimensionality. Optical conductivity reveals an anisotropic but conventional metallic response with low scattering rates and a single sharp infrared-active phonon mode at $396$ cm$^{-1}$ ($49$ meV). Ab initio calculations closely match the experimental optical data and confirm a three-dimensional electronic structure. Our results demonstrate that TaNiTe$_5$ behaves as a three-dimensional anisotropic semimetal in its electronic and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process with the inverse multiquadric kernel, whose posterior variance contours delineate data-supported regions from extrapolated ones. A rotated coordinate frame decomposes the RMSD plane into reaction progress and orthogonal distance. We show the utility of the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, where a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a Grignard rearrangement, and a conrotatory bicyclobutane ring opening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-field simulations are a practical but also expensive tool to calculate microstructural evolution. This work aims to compare explicit time integrators for a broad class of phase-field models involving coupling between the phase-field and concentration. Particular integrators are adapted to constraints on the phase-field as well as storage scheme implications. Reproducible benchmarks are defined with a focus on having exact sharp interface solutions, allowing for identification of dominant error terms. Speedups of 4 to 114 over the classic forward Euler integrator are achievable while still using a fully explicit scheme without appreciable accuracy loss. Application examples include final stage sintering with pores slowing down grain growth as they move and merge over time.</description>

Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagom\'e lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $\mathcal O(N^3)$ and $\mathcal O(N^2)$, respectively, with an arbitrary basis, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Profiling THz Beams With Off-Label Use of Infrared Microbolometric Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing the spatial profile of light beams is essential for evaluating irradiance, characterizing beam quality, and achieving precise alignment. In the optical spectral range, this is readily performed using silicon-based CCD and CMOS cameras. In the terahertz (THz) range, however, it typically requires specialized detectors with prohibitive costs. Here, we show that an infrared (IR) camera can be used outside of its labeled specifications to achieve similar performance as a dedicated microbolometric THz camera, at under 1% of the THz camera's cost. We compared the cameras by characterizing THz beam profiles from two sources: a pulsed broadband THz beam produced through optical rectification in organic crystals, and a narrowband quasi-continuous-wave (quasi-CW) THz beam emitted by a quantum cascade laser. For the broadband THz radiation, the beam width measured by the two cameras differed by only ~ 6%, well within the pixel resolution limit, and in the narrowband quasi-CW case by just ~ 1.3%. Additionally, both cameras show linear responsivity over a comparable irradiance range. These results expand the applicability of conventional IR cameras to the THz range, suggesting that they will become routine tools for high-fidelity THz beam diagnostics and imaging in scientific and industrial applications.</description>
