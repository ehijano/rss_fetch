      <title>System Identification and Control Using Lyapunov-Based Deep Neural Networks without Persistent Excitation: A Concurrent Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in control applications due to their powerful function approximation capabilities. However, many existing formulations focus primarily on tracking error convergence, often neglecting the challenge of identifying the system dynamics using the DNN. This paper presents the first result on simultaneous trajectory tracking and online system identification using a DNN-based controller, without requiring persistent excitation. Two new concurrent learning adaptation laws are constructed for the weights of all the layers of the DNN, achieving convergence of the DNN's parameter estimates to a neighborhood of their ideal values, provided the DNN's Jacobian satisfies a finite-time excitation condition. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to ensure convergence of the tracking error, weight estimation errors, and observer errors to a neighborhood of the origin. Simulations performed on a range of systems and trajectories, with the same initial and operating conditions, demonstrated 40.5% to 73.6% improvement in function approximation performance compared to the baseline, while maintaining a similar tracking error and control effort. Simulations evaluating function approximation capabilities on data points outside of the trajectory resulted in 58.88% and 74.75% improvement in function approximation compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Mesh Stability Guaranteed Rigid Body Networks Using Control and Topology Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging and splitting are of great significance for rigid body networks in making such networks reconfigurable. The main challenges lie in simultaneously ensuring the compositionality of the distributed controllers and the mesh stability of the entire network. To this end, we propose a decentralized control and topology co-design method for rigid body networks, which enables flexible joining and leaving of rigid bodies without the need to redesign the controllers for the entire network after such maneuvers. We first provide a centralized linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based control and topology co-design optimization of the rigid body networks with a formal mesh stability guarantee. Then, these centralized mesh stability constraints are made decentralized by a proposed alternative set of sufficient conditions. Using these decentralized mesh stability constraints and Sylvester's criterion-based decentralization techniques, the said centralized LMI problem is equivalently broken down into a set of smaller decentralized LMI problems that can be solved at each rigid body, enabling flexible merging/splitting of rigid bodies. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method is illustrated based on a specifically developed simulator and a comparison study with respect to a state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Admittance-Based Fault Current Limiting Method for Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverter-based resources (IBRs) are a key component in the ongoing modernization of power systems, with grid-forming (GFM) inverters playing a central role. Effective fault current limiting is a major challenge to modernizing power systems through increased penetration of GFM inverters. Due to their voltage-source nature, GFM inverters offer no direct control over the output current and, therefore, are susceptible to high fault currents. This vulnerability is especially pronounced during large phase jumps, a condition overlooked by most fault current limiting methods. This paper proposes a hybrid fault current limiting method implemented through a virtual admittance by leveraging the advantages of two virtual impedance (VI)-based methods tailored for three-phase faults and phase jump disturbances. Electromagnetic transient simulations conducted in MATLAB-Simulink demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various disturbances, validating its potential in single-loop GFM structures.</description>

      <title>User-centric Vehicle-to-Grid Optimization with an Input Convex Neural Network-based Battery Degradation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation, controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging strategies under realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lifelong reinforcement learning for health-aware fast charging of lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries remains a critical bottleneck for widespread adoption of electric vehicles and stationary energy storage systems, as improperly designed fast charging can accelerate battery degradation and shorten lifespan. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a health-aware fast charging strategy that explicitly balances charging speed and battery longevity across the entire service life. The key innovation lies in establishing a mapping between anode overpotential and the state of health (SoH) of battery, which is then used to constrain the terminal charging voltage in a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) framework. By incorporating this SoH-dependent voltage constraint, our designed deep learning method mitigates side reactions and effectively extends battery life. To validate the proposed approach, a high-fidelity single particle model with electrolyte is implemented in the widely adopted PyBaMM simulation platform, capturing degradation phenomena at realistic scales. Comparative life-cycle simulations against conventional CC-CV, its variants, and constant current-constant overpotential methods show that the TD3-based controller reduces overall degradation while maintaining competitively fast charge times. These results demonstrate the practical viability of deep reinforcement learning for advanced battery management systems and pave the way for future explorations of health-aware, performance-optimized charging strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond KL-divergence: Risk Aware Control Through Cross Entropy and Adversarial Entropy Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the idea of robust dynamic programming (DP) is compelling for systems affected by uncertainty, addressing worst-case disturbances generally results in excessive conservatism. This paper introduces a method for constructing control policies robust to adversarial disturbance distributions that relate to a provided empirical distribution. The character of the adversary is shaped by a regularization term comprising a weighted sum of (i) the cross-entropy between the empirical and the adversarial distributions, and (ii) the entropy of the adversarial distribution itself. The regularization weights are interpreted as the likelihood factor and the temperature respectively. The proposed framework leads to an efficient DP-like algorithm -- referred to as the minsoftmax algorithm -- to obtain the optimal control policy, where the disturbances follow an analytical softmax distribution in terms of the empirical distribution, temperature, and likelihood factor. It admits a number of control-theoretic interpretations and can thus be understood as a flexible tool for integrating complementary features of related control frameworks. In particular, in the linear model quadratic cost setting, with a Gaussian empirical distribution, we draw connections to the well-known $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-control. We illustrate our results through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Symbolic Control for Safety-Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0, we introduce a framework for synthesizing Abstraction-Based Controller Design (ABCD) for reach-avoid problems from Natural Language (NL) specifications using Large Language Models (LLMs). A Code Agent interprets an NL description of the control problem and translates it into a formal language interpretable by state-of-the-art symbolic control software, while a Checker Agent verifies the correctness of the generated code and enhances safety by identifying specification mismatches. Evaluations show that the system handles linguistic variability and improves robustness over direct planning with LLMs. The proposed approach lowers the barrier to formal control synthesis by enabling intuitive, NL-based task definition while maintaining safety guarantees through automated validation.</description>

      <title>Event disturbance rejection: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the problem of robust event disturbance rejection. Inspired by the design principle of linear output regulation, a control structure based on excitable systems is proposed. Unlike the linear case, contraction of the closed-loop system must be enforced through specific input signals. This induced contraction enables a steady-state analysis similar to the linear case. Thanks to the excitable nature of the systems, the focus shifts from precise trajectory tracking to the regulation of discrete events, such as spikes. The study emphasizes rejecting events rather than trajectories and demonstrates the robustness of the approach, even under mismatches between the controller and the exosystem. This work is a first step towards developing a design principle for event regulation.</description>

      <title>Formal Uncertainty Propagation for Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Additive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider discrete-time non-linear stochastic dynamical systems with additive process noise in which both the initial state and noise distributions are uncertain. Our goal is to quantify how the uncertainty in these distributions is propagated by the system dynamics for possibly infinite time steps. In particular, we model the uncertainty over input and noise as ambiguity sets of probability distributions close in the $\rho$-Wasserstein distance and aim to quantify how these sets evolve over time. Our approach relies on results from quantization theory, optimal transport, and stochastic optimization to construct ambiguity sets of distributions centered at mixture of Gaussian distributions that are guaranteed to contain the true sets for both finite and infinite prediction time horizons. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in various benchmarks from the control and machine learning literature, showing how our approach can efficiently and formally quantify the uncertainty in linear and non-linear stochastic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>From noisy observables to accurate ground state energies: a quantum classical signal subspace approach with denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for ground state energy (GSE) estimation that remains robust to highly noisy data and exhibits low sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. Our approach -- Fourier Denoising Observable Dynamic Mode Decomposition (FDODMD) -- combines Fourier-based denoising thresholding to suppress spurious noise modes with observable dynamic mode decomposition (ODMD), a quantum-classical signal subspace method. By applying ODMD to an ensemble of denoised time-domain trajectories, FDODMD reliably estimates the system's eigenfrequencies. We also provide an error analysis of FDODMD. Numerical experiments on molecular systems demonstrate that FDODMD achieves convergence in high-noise regimes inaccessible to baseline methods under a limited quantum computational budget, while accelerating spectral estimation in intermediate-noise regimes. Importantly, this performance gain is entirely classical, requiring no additional quantum overhead and significantly reducing overall quantum resource demands.</description>

      <title>Optimal $\mathbb{H}_2$ Control with Passivity-Constrained Feedback: Convex Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $\mathbb{H}_2$-optimal feedback control problem, for the case in which the plant is passive with bounded $\mathbb{L}_2$ gain, and the feedback law is constrained to be output-strictly passive. In this circumstance, we show that this problem distills to a convex optimal control problem, in which the optimization domain is the associated Youla parameter for the closed-loop system. This enables the globally-optimal controller to be solved as an infinite-dimensional but convex optimization. Near-optimal solutions may be found through the finite-dimensional convex truncation of this infinite-dimensional domain. The idea is demonstrated on a simple vibration suppression example.</description>

      <title>RAN Tester UE: An Automated Declarative UE Centric Security Testing Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular networks require strict security procedures and measures across various network components, from core to radio access network (RAN) and end-user devices. As networks become increasingly complex and interconnected, as in O-RAN deployments, they are exposed to a numerous security threats. Therefore, ensuring robust security is critical for O-RAN to protect network integrity and safeguard user data. This requires rigorous testing methodologies to mitigate threats. This paper introduces an automated, adaptive, and scalable user equipment (UE) based RAN security testing framework designed to address the shortcomings of existing RAN testing solutions. Experimental results on a 5G software radio testbed built with commercial off-the-shelf hardware and open source software validate the efficiency and reproducibility of sample security test procedures developed on the RAN Tester UE framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of securing task offloading transmissions from ground users against ground eavesdropping threats. Our study introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme to enhance the secure task offloading while minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV subject to task completion constraints. Leveraging a data-driven approach, we propose a comprehensive optimization strategy that jointly optimizes the aerial MEC (AMEC)'s trajectory, task offloading partitioning, UE transmission scheduling, and RIS phase shifts. Our objective centers on optimizing the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of UE task offloading transmissions while preserving the AMEC's energy resources and meeting the task completion time requirements. Numerical results show that the proposed solution can effectively safeguard legitimate task offloading transmissions while preserving AMEC energy.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Black-Box Optimization Methods for Weather Intervention Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As climate change increases the threat of weather-related disasters, research on weather control is gaining importance. The objective of weather control is to mitigate disaster risks by administering interventions with optimal timing, location, and intensity. However, the optimization process is highly challenging due to the vast scale and complexity of weather phenomena, which introduces two major challenges. First, obtaining accurate gradient information for optimization is difficult. In addition, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models demand enormous computational resources, necessitating parameter optimization with minimal function evaluations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a method for designing weather interventions based on black-box optimization, which enables efficient exploration without requiring gradient information. The proposed method is evaluated in two distinct control scenarios: one-shot initial value intervention and sequential intervention based on model predictive control. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted among four representative black-box optimization methods in terms of total rainfall reduction. Experimental results show that Bayesian optimization achieves higher control effectiveness than the others, particularly in high-dimensional search spaces. These findings suggest that Bayesian optimization is a highly effective approach for weather intervention computation.</description>

Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approaches for mobile robots remains challenging in forest or arboreal fruit farming environments, where tree canopies obstruct Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals. Unlike indoor settings, these agricultural environments possess additional challenges due to outdoor variables such as foliage motion and illumination variability. This paper proposes a solution based on 2D lidar measurements, which requires less processing and storage, and is more cost-effective, than approaches that employ 3D lidars. Utilizing the modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) metric, the method can solve the scan matching robustly and with high accuracy without needing sophisticated feature extraction. The method's robustness was validated using public datasets and considering various metrics, facilitating meaningful comparisons for future research. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly A-LOAM, show that the proposed approach achieves lower positional and angular errors while maintaining higher accuracy and resilience in GNSS-denied settings. This work contributes to the advancement of precision agriculture by enabling reliable and autonomous navigation in challenging outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10947v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of certifying the stability of closed-loop systems under control policies derived from optimal control or reinforcement learning (RL). Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict step-wise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such a certificate is difficult to construct for a learned control policy. The value function associated with an RL policy is a natural Lyapunov function candidate but it is not clear how it should be modified. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel gradient based scalable procedure for $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}-$control design. We compute the gradient using algebraic Riccati equation and then couple it with a novel Armijo rule inspired step-size selection procedure. We perform numerical experiments of the proposed solution procedure on an exhaustive list of benchmark engineering systems to show its convergence properties.

      <title>DRL-Based Injection Molding Process Parameter Optimization for Adaptive and Profitable Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic injection molding remains essential to modern manufacturing. However, optimizing process parameters to balance product quality and profitability under dynamic environmental and economic conditions remains a persistent challenge. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework for real-time process optimization in injection molding, integrating product quality and profitability into the control objective. A profit function was developed to reflect real-world manufacturing costs, incorporating resin, mold wear, and electricity prices, including time-of-use variations. Surrogate models were constructed to predict product quality and cycle time, enabling efficient offline training of DRL agents using soft actor-critic (SAC) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DRL framework can dynamically adapt to seasonal and operational variations, consistently maintaining product quality while maximizing profit. Compared to traditional optimization methods such as genetic algorithms, the DRL models achieved comparable economic performance with up to 135x faster inference speeds, making them well-suited for real-time applications. The framework's scalability and adaptability highlight its potential as a foundation for intelligent, data-driven decision-making in modern manufacturing environments.</description>

      <title>Sliding Speed Influences Electrovibration-Induced Finger Friction Dynamics on Touchscreens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrovibration technology can render tactile textures on capacitive touchscreens by modulating friction between the finger and the screen through electrostatic attraction force generated by applying an alternating voltage signal to the screen. This signal should be carefully calibrated for realistic and robust texture rendering. However, this process is challenging due to variations in sliding speed, applied force, and individual skin mechanics, which affect friction in complex and unpredictable ways. Here, we investigate how exploration conditions affect electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens and the role of skin mechanics in this process. Ten participants slid their index fingers across an electrovibration-enabled touchscreen at five sliding speeds ($20\sim100$ mm/s) and applied force levels ($0.2\sim0.6$ N) while we measured contact forces and skin accelerations. The touchscreen was excited with amplitude-modulated voltage signals across frequencies relevant to touch. We modeled the finger-touchscreen friction response as a first-order system and the skin mechanics as a mass-spring-damper system. Our results showed that the sliding speed influenced the cutoff frequency of the friction response as well as the moving mass and stiffness of the finger for the tested exploration ranges. Specifically, for every 1 mm/s increase in speed, the cutoff frequency, the finger moving mass, and stiffness increased by $13.8$ Hz, $3.23\times 10^{-5}$ kg, and $4.04$ N/m, respectively. Further correlation analysis revealed that finger stiffness affected the cutoff frequency more than the moving mass. Finally, we developed a practical model for electrovibration-induced finger friction on touchscreens that accounts for sliding speed variations, paving the way for delivering consistent haptic feedback through electrovibration.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Transmission Expansion Planning with Joint Chance-Constrained Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In transmission expansion planning (TEP), network planners make long-term investment decisions while anticipating market clearing outcomes that are increasingly affected by renewable generation uncertainty. Additionally, market participants' sensitivity to network charges and the requirement for cost recovery by the network planner introduce further complexity. Since the day-ahead market clears before uncertainty realizes, explicitly modelling these uncertainties at the lower-level market clearing becomes important in bilevel TEP problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel bilevel TEP framework with lower-level joint chance-constrained market clearing that manages line flow constraints under wind uncertainty and accounts for the effect of network tariffs on participants' actual marginal costs and utility. To solve this complex problem, we propose a Strengthened Linear Approximation (SLA) technique for handling Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints with right-hand-side uncertainties (RHS-WDRJCC). The proposed method offers more efficient approximations without additional conservativeness and avoids the numerical issues encountered in existing approaches by introducing valid inequalities. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the desired out-of-sample constraint satisfaction probability. Moreover, the numerical results highlight the significant computational advantage of SLA, achieving up to a 26x speedup compared to existing methods such as worst-case conditional value-at-risk, while maintaining high solution quality.</description>

      <title>Learning Multimodal AI Algorithms for Amplifying Limited User Input into High-dimensional Control Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current invasive assistive technologies are designed to infer high-dimensional motor control signals from severely paralyzed patients. However, they face significant challenges, including public acceptance, limited longevity, and barriers to commercialization. Meanwhile, noninvasive alternatives often rely on artifact-prone signals, require lengthy user training, and struggle to deliver robust high-dimensional control for dexterous tasks. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel human-centered multimodal AI approach as intelligent compensatory mechanisms for lost motor functions that could potentially enable patients with severe paralysis to control high-dimensional assistive devices, such as dexterous robotic arms, using limited and noninvasive inputs. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art (SoTA) noninvasive approaches, our context-aware, multimodal shared-autonomy framework integrates deep reinforcement learning algorithms to blend limited low-dimensional user input with real-time environmental perception, enabling adaptive, dynamic, and intelligent interpretation of human intent for complex dexterous manipulation tasks, such as pick-and-place. The results from our ARAS (Adaptive Reinforcement learning for Amplification of limited inputs in Shared autonomy) trained with synthetic users over 50,000 computer simulation episodes demonstrated the first successful implementation of the proposed closed-loop human-in-the-loop paradigm, outperforming the SoTA shared autonomy algorithms. Following a zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, ARAS was evaluated on 23 human subjects, demonstrating high accuracy in dynamic intent detection and smooth, stable 3D trajectory control for dexterous pick-and-place tasks. ARAS user study achieved a high task success rate of 92.88%, with short completion times comparable to those of SoTA invasive assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>IISE PG&amp;E Energy Analytics Challenge 2025: Hourly-Binned Regression Models Beat Transformers in Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate electricity load forecasting is essential for grid stability, resource optimization, and renewable energy integration. While transformer-based deep learning models like TimeGPT have gained traction in time-series forecasting, their effectiveness in long-term electricity load prediction remains uncertain. This study evaluates forecasting models ranging from classical regression techniques to advanced deep learning architectures using data from the ESD 2025 competition. The dataset includes two years of historical electricity load data, alongside temperature and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across five sites, with a one-day-ahead forecasting horizon. Since actual test set load values remain undisclosed, leveraging predicted values would accumulate errors, making this a long-term forecasting challenge. We employ (i) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and (ii) frame the task as a regression problem, using temperature and GHI as covariates to predict load for each hour, (iii) ultimately stacking 24 models to generate yearly forecasts.
  Our results reveal that deep learning models, including TimeGPT, fail to consistently outperform simpler statistical and machine learning approaches due to the limited availability of training data and exogenous variables. In contrast, XGBoost, with minimal feature engineering, delivers the lowest error rates across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency. This highlights the limitations of deep learning in long-term electricity forecasting and reinforces the importance of model selection based on dataset characteristics rather than complexity. Our study provides insights into practical forecasting applications and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the trade-offs between traditional and modern forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>REACT: Runtime-Enabled Active Collision-avoidance Technique for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving rapid and effective active collision avoidance in dynamic interactive traffic remains a core challenge for autonomous driving. This paper proposes REACT (Runtime-Enabled Active Collision-avoidance Technique), a closed-loop framework that integrates risk assessment with active avoidance control. By leveraging energy transfer principles and human-vehicle-road interaction modeling, REACT dynamically quantifies runtime risk and constructs a continuous spatial risk field. The system incorporates physically grounded safety constraints such as directional risk and traffic rules to identify high-risk zones and generate feasible, interpretable avoidance behaviors. A hierarchical warning trigger strategy and lightweight system design enhance runtime efficiency while ensuring real-time responsiveness. Evaluations across four representative high-risk scenarios including car-following braking, cut-in, rear-approaching, and intersection conflict demonstrate REACT's capability to accurately identify critical risks and execute proactive avoidance. Its risk estimation aligns closely with human driver cognition (i.e., warning lead time &lt; 0.4 s), achieving 100% safe avoidance with zero false alarms or missed detections. Furthermore, it exhibits superior real-time performance (&lt; 50 ms latency), strong foresight, and generalization. The lightweight architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in safety-critical autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, many control systems are networked and embed communication and computation capabilities. Such control architectures are prone to cyber attacks on the cyberinfrastructure. Consequently, there is an impellent need to develop solutions to preserve the plant's safety against potential attacks. To ensure safety, this paper introduces a modular safety filter approach that is effective for various cyber-attack types. This solution can be implemented in combination with existing control and detection algorithms, effectively separating safety from performance. The safety filter does not require information on the received command's reliability or the anomaly detector's feature. It can be implemented in conjunction with high-performance, resilient controllers to achieve both high performance during normal operation and safety during an attack. As an illustrative example, we have shown the effectiveness of the proposed design considering a multi-agent formation task involving 20 mobile robots. The simulation results testify that the safety filter operates effectively during undetectable, intelligent attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04508v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To optimize the dispatch of batteries, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory for a chosen open-loop power schedule to ensure admissibility (i.e., that schedule can be realized). However, battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we develop a novel composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while guaranteeing admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and its disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</description>

Abstract: Predicting flutter remains a key challenge in aeroelastic research, with certain models relying on modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and damping ratios. These models are particularly useful in early design stages or for the development of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (maximum take-off mass below 7 kg). This study evaluates two frequency-domain system identification methods, Fast Relaxed Vector Fitting (FRVF) and the Loewner Framework (LF), for predicting the flutter onset speed of a flexible wing model. Both methods are applied to extract modal parameters from Ground Vibration Testing data, which are subsequently used to develop a reduced-order model with two degrees of freedom. Results indicate that FRVF and LF-informed models provide reliable flutter speed, with predictions deviating by no more than 3% (FRVF) and 5% (LF) from the N4SID-informed benchmark. The findings highlight the sensitivity of flutter speed predictions to damping ratio identification accuracy and demonstrate the potential of these methods as computationally efficient alternatives for preliminary aeroelastic assessments.</description>

      <title>Large Vision Model-Enhanced Digital Twin with Deep Reinforcement Learning for User Association and Load Balancing in Dynamic Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: Optimization of user association in a densely deployed cellular network is usually challenging and even more complicated due to the dynamic nature of user mobility and fluctuation in user counts. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. Also, existing DRL-based user association methods are typically applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce a large vision model (LVM)-enhanced digital twin (DT) for wireless networks and propose a parallel DT-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. To construct this LVM-enhanced DT for DRL training, we develop a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on the diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. DRL models undergo training in the DT environment, avoiding direct interactions with physical networks. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve training efficiency. Numerical results show that the developed LVM-enhanced DT achieves closely comparable training efficacy to the real environment, and the proposed parallel DT framework even outperforms the single real-world environment in DRL training with nearly 20\% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a Control Framework for Physical Human-Robot Interaction Toward Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is critical for implementing Industry 5.0, which focuses on human-centric approaches. However, few studies explore the practical alignment of pHRI to industrial-grade performance. This paper introduces a versatile control framework designed to bridge this gap by incorporating the torque-based control modes: compliance control, null-space compliance, and dual compliance, all in static and dynamic scenarios. Thanks to our second-order Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation, strict kinematic and collision constraints are integrated into the system as safety features, and a weighted hierarchy guarantees singularity-robust task tracking performance. The framework is implemented on a Kinova Gen3 collaborative robot (cobot) equipped with a Bota force/torque sensor. A DualShock 4 game controller is attached to the robot's end-effector to demonstrate the framework's capabilities. This setup enables seamless dynamic switching between the modes, and real-time adjustments of parameters, such as transitioning between position and torque control or selecting a more robust custom-developed low-level torque controller over the default one. Built on the open-source robotic control software mc_rtc, our framework ensures reproducibility for both research and industrial deployment, this framework demonstrates a step toward industrial-grade performance and repeatability, showcasing its potential as a robust pHRI control system for industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Experimental evaluation of xApp Conflict Mitigation Framework in O-RAN: Insights from Testbed deployment in OTIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conflict Mitigation (CM) in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is a topic that is gaining importance as commercial O-RAN deployments become more complex. Although research on CM is already covered in terms of simulated network scenarios, it lacks validation using real-world deployment and Over The Air (OTA) Radio Frequency (RF) transmission. Our objective is to conduct the first assessment of the Conflict Mitigation Framework (CMF) for O-RAN using a real-world testbed and OTA RF transmission. This paper presents results of an experiment using a dedicated testbed built in an O-RAN Open Test and Integration Center (OTIC) to confirm the validity of one of the Conflict Resolution (CR) schemes proposed by existing research. The results show that the implemented conflict detection and resolution mechanisms allow a significant improvement in network operation stability by reducing the variability of the measured Downlink (DL) throughput by 78%.</description>

      <title>A finite-sample bound for identifying partially observed linear switched systems from a single trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a finite-sample probabilistic bound on the parameter estimation error of a system identification algorithm for Linear Switched Systems. The algorithm estimates Markov parameters from a single trajectory and applies a variant of the Ho-Kalman algorithm to recover the system matrices. Our bound guarantees statistical consistency under the assumption that the true system exhibits quadratic stability. The proof leverages the theory of weakly dependent processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finite-sample bound for this algorithm in the single-trajectory setting.</description>

      <title>Satellite Autonomous Clock Fault Monitoring with Inter-Satellite Ranges Using Euclidean Distance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from dual one-way inter-satellite links. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite positions or clock biases, providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks with diverse satellite types and operators. We model satellite constellations as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 5-clique sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations.</description>

      <title>Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface Using Error-State Kalman Filter and Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering a drone on a disturbed water surface remains a significant challenge in maritime robotics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF), and secondly, effective motion planning for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Specifically, the ESKF predicts the drone's future position 0.5s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited torque constraints. We provide a system design that comprises a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem. On the UAV side, we detail how position control and suspended payload strategies are implemented. On the manipulator side, we show how an RHC scheme outperforms traditional low-level control algorithms. Simulation and real-world experiments - using wave-disturbed motion data - demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10% in efficiency and 20% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</description>

      <title>Visual Feedback of Pattern Separability Improves Myoelectric Decoding Performance of Upper Limb Prostheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beam-Stabilized, Additive-Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays with On-Chip Rapid Insight Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with &lt; 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.</description>
