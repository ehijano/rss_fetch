      <title>First Order Algorithm on an Optimization Problem with Improved Convergence when Problem is Convex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a first order algorithm, a modified version of FISTA, to solve an optimization problem with an objective function that is a sum of a possibly nonconvex function, with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and a convex function which can be nonsmooth. The algorithm is shown to have an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to find an $\epsilon$-approximate solution to the problem, and this complexity improves to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ when the objective function turns out to be convex. We further provide asymptotic convergence rate for the algorithm of worst case $o(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations to find an $\epsilon$-approximate solution to the problem, with worst case $o(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ iterations when its objective function is convex.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for relative controllability of discrete linear delay systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate delayed linear difference systems and establish several fundamental results. We first provide a Kalman-type rank condition tailored for delayed linear difference systems. Furthermore, we construct the discrete Gramian matrix and prove its non-singularity, which is essential for analyzing system properties. Additionally, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring the relative controllability of the system. Finally, we formulate the control function for effective system control and validate our theoretical findings with numerical examples. These examples illustrate the practical behavior of discrete linear delay systems.</description>

      <title>Observed Control -- Linearly Scalable Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Adaptive Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work highlights the duality between state estimation methods and model predictive control. A predictive controller, observed control, is presented that uses this duality to efficiently compute control actions with linear time-horizon length scalability. The proposed algorithms provide exceptional computational efficiency, adaptive time horizon lengths, and early optimization termination criteria. The use of Kalman smoothers as the backend optimization framework provides for a straightforward implementation supported by strong theoretical guarantees. Additionally, a formulation is presented that separates linear model predictive control into purely reactive and anticipatory components, enabling any-time any-horizon observed control while ensuring controller stability for short time horizons. Finally, numerical case studies confirm that nonlinear filter extensions, i.e., the extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter, effectively extend observed control to nonlinear systems and objectives.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Strategies for Pension Fund Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based framework for assessing and improving the performance of a pension fund management scheme. This framework is modular and allows the definition of customized performance metrics that are used to assess and iteratively improve asset and liability management policies. We illustrate our framework with a simple implementation that showcases the power of including adaptable features. We show that it is possible to dissipate longevity and volatility risks by permitting adaptability in asset allocation and payout levels. The numerical results show that by including a small amount of flexibility, there can be a substantial reduction in the cost to run the pension plan as well as a substantial decrease in the probability of defaulting.</description>

      <title>When Does Selfishness Align with Team Goals? A Structural Analysis of Equilibrium and Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the team-optimal solution and the Nash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of self-interested decisions on team performance. In classical team decision problems, team members typically act cooperatively towards a common objective to achieve a team-optimal solution. However, in practice, members may behave selfishly by prioritizing their goals, resulting in an NE under a non-cooperative game. To study this misalignment, we develop a parameterized model for team and game problems, where game parameters represent each individual's deviation from the team objective. The study begins by exploring the consistency and deviation between the NE and the team-optimal solution under fixed game parameters. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for any NE to be a team optimum, along with establishing an upper bound to measure their difference when the consistency condition fails. The exploration then focuses on aligning NE strategies towards the team-optimal solution through the adjustment of game parameters, resulting in a non-convex and non-smooth bi-level optimization problem. We propose a hypergradient-based algorithm for this problem, and establish its convergence to the critical points. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Online Stochastic Packing with General Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in studying online stochastic packing under more general correlation structures, motivated by the complex data sets and models driving modern applications. Several past works either assume correlations are weak or have a particular structure, have a complexity scaling with the number of Markovian "states of the world" (which may be exponentially large e.g. in the case of full history dependence), scale poorly with the horizon $T$, or make additional continuity assumptions. Surprisingly, we show that for all $\epsilon$, the online stochastic packing linear programming problem with general correlations (suitably normalized and with sparse columns) has an approximately optimal policy (with optimality gap $\epsilon T$) whose per-decision runtime scales as the time to simulate a single sample path of the underlying stochastic process (assuming access to a Monte Carlo simulator), multiplied by a constant independent of the horizon or number of Markovian states. We derive analogous results for network revenue management, and online bipartite matching and independent set in bounded-degree graphs, by rounding. Our algorithms implement stochastic gradient methods in a novel on-the-fly/recursive manner for the associated massive deterministic-equivalent linear program on the corresponding probability space.</description>

      <title>The L\'evy flight foraging hypothesis: comparison between stationary distributions and anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a stationary prey in a given region of space and we aim at detecting optimal foraging strategies. On the one hand, when the prey is uniformly distributed, the best possible strategy for the forager is to be stationary and uniformly distributed in the same region. On the other hand, in several biological settings, foragers cannot be completely stationary, therefore we investigate the best seeking strategy for L\'evy foragers in terms of the corresponding L\'evy exponent. In this case, we show that the best strategy depends on the region size in which the prey is located: large regions exhibit optimal seeking strategies close to Gaussian random walks, while small regions favor L\'evy foragers with small fractional exponent.
  We also consider optimal strategies in view of the Fourier transform of the distribution of a stationary prey. When this distribution is supported in a suitable volume, then the foraging efficiency functional is monotone increasing with respect to the L\'evy exponent and accordingly the optimal strategy is given by the Gaussian dispersal. If instead the Fourier transform of the distribution of a stationary prey is supported in the complement of a suitable volume, then the foraging efficiency functional is monotone decreasing with respect to the L\'evy exponent and therefore the optimal strategy is given by a null fractional exponent (which in turn corresponds, from a biological standpoint, to a strategy of ``ambush'' type).
  We will devote a rigorous quantitative analysis also to emphasize some specific differences between the one-dimensional and the higher-dimensional cases.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Randomized Smoothing: Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization Beyond Global Lipschitz Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a widely adopted technique for optimizing nonsmooth objective functions. However, its efficiency analysis typically relies on global Lipschitz continuity, a condition rarely met in practical applications. To address this limitation, we introduce a new subgradient growth condition that naturally encompasses a wide range of locally Lipschitz functions, with the classical global Lipschitz function as a special case. Under this milder condition, we prove that randomized smoothing yields a differentiable function that satisfies certain generalized smoothness properties. To optimize such functions, we propose novel randomized smoothing gradient algorithms that, with high probability, converge to $(\delta, \epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary points and achieve a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{5/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-4})$. By incorporating variance reduction techniques, we further improve the sample complexity to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, matching the optimal $\epsilon$-bound under the global Lipschitz assumption, up to a logarithmic factor. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Geometrically Decaying Step Size: Linear Convergence for Smooth or Non-Smooth Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the geometrically decaying step size given a positive condition number, under which a locally Lipschitz function shows linear convergence. The positivity does not require the function to satisfy convexity, weak convexity, quasar convexity, or sharpness, but instead amounts to a property strictly weaker than the assumptions used in existing works. We propose a clean and simple subgradient descent algorithm that requires minimal knowledge of problem constants, applicable to either smooth or non-smooth functions.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Semantic Diffusion: A p-Laplacian Synthesis with Learnable Dissipation, Quantified Constants, and Graph-Aware Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a calibrated diffusion framework by synthesizing three established concepts: linear Laplacian smoothing, nonlinear graph p-Laplacian flows, and a learnable dissipation term derived from a strongly convex potential. This synthesis provides a general model for graph-based diffusion with controllable dynamics. Our key theoretical results include a quantified two-regime decay analysis for $p&gt;2$, which provides stronger, p-dependent transient bounds not captured by standard ISS templates, and the first formalization of a "non-synonymy" impossibility principle, which proves that fixed-parameter models cannot meet universal performance targets across graphs with varying spectral properties. To address this, we propose a constructive calibration algorithm (SGPS) with formal guarantees for achieving target rates and mass. We derive explicit, closed-form lower bounds for the graph p-gap on canonical graphs a notable improvement over prior implicit estimates and provide sharp constants for discrete-time and stochastic stability, including a contextualized restatement of the necessary and sufficient Euler step-size and a strengthened analysis of the stochastic noise floor. Illustrative, small-scale empirical validations confirm the tightness of key theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stochastic trajectory optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing robust space trajectories in nonlinear dynamical environments, such as the Earth-Moon circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), poses significant challenges due to sensitivity to initial conditions and non-Gaussian uncertainty propagation. This work introduces a novel solver for discrete-time chance-constrained trajectory optimization under uncertainty, referred to as stochastic optimization with differential algebra (SODA). SODA combines differential algebra (DA) with adaptive Gaussian mixture decomposition to efficiently propagate non-Gaussian uncertainties, and enforces Gaussian multidimensional chance constraints using scalable, less conservative transcription methods. We further introduce an efficient and accurate failure risk estimation technique, coupled with a risk allocation strategy across mixture components that enables tight and adaptive distribution of safety margins. The framework is validated on five trajectory design problems of increasing dynamical complexity, from heliocentric transfers to challenging Earth-Moon CR3BP scenarios. A linear variant, the linear stochastic optimization with differential algebra (L-SODA) solver, recovers deterministic performance with minimal overhead under small uncertainties, while the nonlinear SODA solver yields improved robustness and tighter constraint satisfaction in strongly nonlinear regimes. Results highlight SODA's ability to generate accurate, robust, and computationally tractable solutions, supporting its potential for future use in uncertainty-aware space mission design.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching-Based Generative Modeling for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.</description>

      <title>HiFo-Prompt: Prompting with Hindsight and Foresight for LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation (EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and superior query efficiency.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Contextual Bandits with Network Adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper, we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>System-Level Performance and Communication Tradeoff in Networked Control with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed control of large-scale systems is challenging due to the need for scalable and localized communication and computation. In this work, we introduce a Predictive System-Level Synthesis PredSLS framework that designs controllers by jointly integrating communication constraints and local disturbance predictions into an affine feedback structure. Rather than focusing on the worst-case uncertainty, PredSLS leverages both current state feedback and future system disturbance predictions to achieve distributed control of networked systems. In particular, PredSLS enables a unified system synthesis of the optimal $\kappa$-localized controller, therefore outperforms approaches with post hoc communication truncation, as was commonly seen in the literature. The PredSLS framework can be naturally decomposed into spatial and temporal components for efficient and parallelizable computation across the network, yielding a regret upper bound that explicitly depends on the prediction error and communication range. Our regret analysis not only reveals a non-monotonic trade-off between control performance and communication range when prediction errors are present, but also guides the identification of an optimal size for local communication neighborhoods, thereby enabling the co-design of controller and its underlying communication topology.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Scalar Selection in Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Differential Evolution for Enhanced Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a fundamental component of modern public-key cryptosystems that enable efficient and secure digital signatures, key exchanges, and encryption. Its core operation, scalar multiplication, denoted as $k \cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar, relies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$ is selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in resource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches may yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to side-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we introduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly maximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a population-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary representations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically uniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection as an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based cryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly higher than conventionally generated scalars. The proposed method can be integrated into existing ECC-based protocols, offering a deterministic, tunable alternative to traditional randomness, ideal for applications in blockchain, secure messaging, IoT, and other resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Amplitude maximization in stable systems, Schur positivity, and some conjectures on polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following ``amplitude maximization'' problem: maximize the quantity $|x_t|$ over the set of complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of all homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the roots of characteristic polynomial in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained in the case of coinciding roots on the boundary circle; this implies that for all $r &lt; 1$, the maximum amplitude can be computed explicitly, by studying a single equation whose characteristic polynomial is $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the co-phase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. Here, we propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Towards safe control parameter tuning in distributed multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Weighted Number of Tardy Jobs: Data-Driven Heuristic for Single-Machine Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight, duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best fit.</description>

      <title>Qudit-based scalable quantum algorithm for solving the integer programming problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integer programming (IP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that is widely used to represent a diverse set of real-world problems spanning multiple fields, such as finance, engineering, logistics, and operations research. It is a hard problem to solve using classical algorithms, as its complexity increases exponentially with problem size. Most quantum algorithms for solving IP are highly resource inefficient because they encode integers into qubits. In [1], the issue of resource inefficiency was addressed by mapping integer variables to qudits. However, [1] has limited practical value due to a lack of scalability to multiple qudits to encode larger problems. In this work, by extending upon the ideas of [1], a circuit-based scalable quantum algorithm is presented using multiple interacting qudits for which we show a quantum speed-up. The quantum algorithm consists of a distillation function that efficiently separates the feasible from the infeasible regions, a phase-amplitude encoding for the cost function, and a quantum phase estimation coupled with a multi-controlled single-qubit rotation for optimization. We prove that the optimal solution has the maximum probability of being measured in our algorithm. The time complexity for the quantum algorithm is shown to be $O(d^{n/2} + m\cdot n^2\cdot \log{d} + n/\epsilon_{QPE})$ for a problem with the number of variables $n$ taking $d$ integer values, satisfying $m$ constraints with a precision of $\epsilon_{QPE}$. Compared to the classical time complexity of brute force $O(d^n)$ and the best classical exact algorithm $O((\log{n})^{3n})$, it incurs a reduction of $d^{n/2}$ in the time complexity in terms of $n$ for solving a general polynomial IP problem.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandits for Personalized Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure, (ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii) heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$ episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e., user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.</description>

      <title>Framework for Modeling and Optimization of On-Orbit Servicing Operations under Demand Uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.08962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework that models and optimizes the operations of complex on-orbit servicing infrastructures involving one or more servicers and orbital depots to provide multiple types of services to a fleet of geostationary satellites. The proposed method extends the state-of-the-art space logistics technique by addressing the unique challenges in on-orbit servicing applications, and integrate it with the Rolling Horizon decision making approach. The space logistics technique enables modeling of the on-orbit servicing logistical operations as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program whose optimal solutions can efficiently be found. The Rolling Horizon approach enables the assessment of the long-term value of an on-orbit servicing infrastructure by accounting for the uncertain service needs that arise over time among the geostationary satellites. Two case studies successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for (1) short-term operational scheduling and (2) long-term strategic decision making for on-orbit servicing architectures under diverse market conditions.</description>

      <title>On-Orbit Servicing Optimization Framework with High- and Low-Thrust Propulsion Tradeoff</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.08963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an on-orbit servicing logistics optimization framework that is capable of performing the short-term operational scheduling and long-term strategic planning of sustainable servicing infrastructures that involve high-thrust, low-thrust, and/or multimodal servicers supported by orbital depots. The proposed framework generalizes the state-of-the-art on-orbit servicing logistics optimization method by incorporating user-defined trajectory models and optimizing the logistics operations with the propulsion technology and trajectory tradeoff in consideration. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming is leveraged to find the optimal operations of the servicers over a given period, while the Rolling Horizon approach is used to consider a long time horizon accounting for the uncertainties in service demand. Several analyses are carried out to demonstrate the value of the proposed framework in automatically trading off the high- and low-thrust propulsion systems for both short-term operational scheduling and long-term strategic planning of on-orbit servicing infrastructures.</description>

Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</description>

Abstract: Branch-price-and-cut algorithms play an important role in solving many vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Adding valid inequalities in this framework can impact the pricing subproblem, for which the literature distinguishes between 'robust' and 'non-robust' cuts. We define the 'robust application' of a cut in a specific context, making this distinction more precise. Next, we define broader 'resource-robust applications' that can be handled efficiently in the subproblem. We then introduce new resource-robust valid inequalities and show computational benefits for the capacitated VRP.</description>

Abstract: Cislunar space domain awareness is of increasing interest to the international community as Earth-Moon traffic is projected to increase, which raises the problem of placing space-based sensors optimally in a constellation to satisfy the space domain awareness demand in cislunar space. This demand profile can vary over space and time, making the design optimization problem challenging. This paper tackles the problem of satellite constellation design for spatio-temporally varying coverage demand by leveraging an integer linear programming formulation. The developed optimization formulation assumes the circular restricted 3-body dynamics and attempts to minimize the number of satellites required for the requested demand profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. Grant et al. (2006) introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). Here, we extend this framework to functions defined on manifolds with non-positive curvature (Hadamard manifolds) by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). In particular, this allows for verifying a broader range of convexity notions. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. To define the DGCP framework, we determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian gradient descent method for optimization on the indefinite Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the optimization problem with a generally quadratic matrix constraint of the form $X^TAX = J$, where $A$ is a given nonsingular, symmetric $n\times n$ matrix and $J$ is a given $k\times k$ symmetric matrix, with $k\leq n$, satisfying $J^2 = I_k$. Since the feasible set constitutes a differentiable manifold, called the indefinite Stiefel manifold, we approach this problem within the framework of Riemannian optimization. Namely, we first equip the manifold with a Riemannian metric and construct the associated geometric structure, then propose a retraction based on the Cayley transform, and finally suggest a Riemannian gradient descent method using the attained materials, whose global convergence is guaranteed. Our results not only cover the known cases, the orthogonal and generalized Stiefel manifolds, but also provide a Riemannian optimization solution for other constrained problems which has not been investigated. As applications, we consider, via trace minimization, several eigenvalue problems of symmetric positive definite matrix pencils, including the linear response eigenvalue problem, and a matrix least square problem, a general framework for the Procrustes problem and constrained matrix equations. The presented numerical results justify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Solving Semi-Linear Elliptic Optimal Control Problems with $L^1$-Cost via Regularization and RAS-Preconditioned Newton Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new parallel computational framework for the efficient solution of a class of $L^2$/$L^1$-regularized optimal control problems governed by semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). The main difficulty in solving this type of problem is the nonlinearity and non-smoothness of the $L^1$-term in the cost functional, which we address by employing a combination of several tools. First, we approximate the non-differentiable projection operator appearing in the optimality system by an appropriately chosen regularized operator and establish convergence of the resulting system's solutions. Second, we apply a continuation strategy to control the regularization parameter to improve the behavior of (damped) Newton methods. Third, we combine Newton's method with a domain-decomposition-based nonlinear preconditioning, which improves its robustness properties and allows for parallelization. The efficiency of the proposed numerical framework is demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Cournot models, this paper proposes novel models of the noncooperative and cooperative differential games with density constraints in infinite dimensions, where markets consist of infinite firms and demand dynamics are governed by controlled differential equations. Markets engage in noncooperative competition with each other, while firms within each market engage in noncooperative or cooperative games. The main problems are to find the noncooperative Nash equilibrium (NNE) of the noncooperative differential game and the mixed Nash equilibrium (MNE) of the mixed noncooperative and cooperative differential game. Moreover, fundamental relationship is established between noncooperative/mixed differential game with density constraints and infinite-dimensional differential variational inequalities with density constraints. By variational analysis, it is proved under two conditions with certain symmetry that both of the two equilibrium problems can be reduced to solving systems of finite-dimensional projection equations with integral constraints by iterative computational methods. Crucially, the two conditions with certain symmetry, ensuring the uniqueness of the NNE and the MNE, provide theoretical foundations for strategic decision making regarding competitive versus cooperative market behaviors. Finally, the theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations demonstrating the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>Instability and Efficiency of Non-cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a non-cooperative game may have multiple equilibria. In this paper we consider the efficiency of games, measured by the ratio between the aggregate payoff over all Nash equilibria and that over all admissible controls. Such efficiency operator is typically unstable with respect to small perturbation of the game. This seemingly bad property can actually be a good news in practice: it is possible that a small change of the game mechanism may improve the efficiency of the game dramatically. We shall introduce a game mediator with limited resources and investigate two mechanism designs aiming to improve the efficiency. Moreover, we compare the mediator's capability of efficiency improvement when she has access to full information or only partial information. When the mechanisms contain only rewards, the mediator has the same power in the two cases. However, when the mediator can use punishments as well, in general she may have a larger power to improve the efficiency in the full information case than in the partial information case.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation and Multiplier Bootstrap for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for constructing the confidence sets using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Under appropriate regularity conditions, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$. Notably, this rate can be faster than the one that can be proven in the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem. To our knowledge, this provides the first fully non-asymptotic bound on the accuracy of bootstrap approximations in SGD algorithms. Our analysis builds on the Gaussian approximation results for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables.</description>

      <title>Improving DAPO from a Mixed-Policy Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm [1], approached from a mixed-policy perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this, we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size. Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods, demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Tailored First-order and Interior-point methods and a new semidefinite programming hierarchy for entanglement detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information science, yet its reliable detection in high-dimensional or noisy systems remains a fundamental computational challenge. Semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies, such as the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) and Extension (EXT) hierarchies, offer complete methods for entanglement detection, but their practical use is limited by exponential growth in problem size. In this paper, we introduce a new SDP hierarchy, PST, that is sandwiched between EXT and DPS--offering a tighter approximation to the set of separable states than EXT, while incurring lower computational overhead than DPS.
  We develop compact, polynomially-scalable descriptions of EXT and PST using partition mappings and operators. These descriptions in turn yield formulations that satisfy desirable properties such as the Slater condition and are well-suited to both first-order methods (FOMs) and interior-point methods (IPMs). We design a suite of entanglement detection algorithms: three FOMs (Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient, and fast projected gradient) based on a least-squares formulation, and a custom primal-dual IPM based on a conic programming formulation. These methods are numerically stable and capable of producing entanglement witnesses or proximity measures, even in cases where states lie near the boundary of separability.
  Numerical experiments on benchmark quantum states demonstrate that our algorithms improve the ability to solve deeper levels of the SDP hierarchy. In particular, the PST hierarchy combined with FOMs enables scalable and effective entanglement detection in relatively easy instances, while our IPM approach offers robustness and early witness recovery for the more difficult ones. Our results highlight the benefits of tailoring algorithmic formulations to hierarchy structure to advance entanglement detection at scale.</description>
