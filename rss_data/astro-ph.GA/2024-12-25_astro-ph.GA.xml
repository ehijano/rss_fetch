      <title>Why do galaxies have extended flat rotation curves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by Mistele et al. show that the circular velocity curves of isolated galaxies remain flat out to the largest radii probed so far, i.e. $\approx 1$ Mpc. The velocity decline beyond the expected virial radius is not observed. These results imply that the galaxy halo is in thermal equilibrium even at large radii where particles did not have time to relax. The galaxies must have already formed in the isothermal state. How is this possible? In the present note we try to understand the formation of galaxies with warm dark matter in the expanding universe.</description>

      <title>Global and Local Infall in the ASHES Sample (GLASHES). I. Pilot Study in G337.541</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-angular-resolution observations indicate the need for core growth to form high-mass stars. To understand the gas dynamics at the core scale in the very early evolutionary stages before being severely affected by feedback, we have conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward a 70 $\mu$m dark massive clump, G337.541-00.082 as part of the Global and Local infall in the ASHES sample (GLASHES) program. Using dense gas tracers such as N$_2$H$^+$ ($J = 1-0$) and HNC ($J = 3-2$), we find signs of infall from the position-velocity diagram and more directly from the blue asymmetry profile in addition to the clump-scale velocity gradient. We estimate infall velocities from intermediate and low-mass cores to be 0.28-1.45 km s$^{-1}$, and infall rates to be on the order of 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, both are higher than those measured in low-mass star-forming regions by more than a factor of five and an order of magnitude, respectively. We find a strong correlation of the infall velocity with the nonthermal velocity dispersion, suggesting that infall may contribute significantly to the observed line width. Consistent with clump-fed scenarios, we show that the mass infall rate is larger for larger core masses and shorter distances to the clump center. Such high infall rates in cores embedded in IRDCs can be considered as strong signs of core growth, allowing high-mass star formation from intermediate-mass cores that would not initially form high-mass stars at their current mass.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Dark Matter spikes: origin and growth of Black Hole seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the overdensity (spike) of fermionic dark matter (DM) particles around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) within a general relativistic analysis. The initial DM halo distribution is obtained by solving the equilibrium equations of a self-gravitating system of massive fermions at a finite temperature, according to the Ruffini-Arg\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model. The final fermionic DM spike is calculated around a Schwarzschild SMBH. We explore two possible interpretations for the origin and evolution of the SMBH seed. One corresponds to the traditional scenario proposed by Gondolo &amp; Silk (1999), where a small BH mass of baryonic origin sits at the halo's center and grows adiabatically. The other one, from DM origin, where the dense and degenerate fermion core predicted by the RAR model grows adiabatically by capturing baryons until its gravitational collapse, providing a heavy SMBH seed, whose specific value depends on the fermion mass. We study different initial fermionic DM profiles that the theory allows. We show that overall dilute (i.e., Boltzmannian) fermionic DM develops the well-known spike with density profile $\rho \sim r^{-3/2}$. Instead, for semi-degenerate fermions with a dense and compact core surrounded by a diluted halo, we find novel spike profiles that depend on the particle mass and nature. In the more general case, fermionic spikes do not develop a simple power-law profile. Furthermore, the SMBH does not always imply an enhancement of the surrounding DM density; it might also deplete it. Thus, the self-consistent inclusion of the DM candidate nature and mass in determining the structure and distribution of DM in galaxies, including the DM spikes around SMBHs, is essential for the specification of DM astrophysical probes such as BH mergers, gravitational waves, or stellar orbits.</description>

      <title>A Large Molecular Gas Reservoir in the Protocluster SPT2349$-$56 at $z\,{=}\,4.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Compact Array (ACA) Band-3 observations of the protocluster SPT2349$-$56, an extreme system hosting ${\gtrsim}\,12$ submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\,{=}\,4.3$, to study its integrated molecular gas content via CO(4-3) and long-wavelength dust continuum. The $\sim$30-hour integration represents one of the longest exposures yet taken on a single pointing with the ACA 7-m. The low-resolution ACA data ($21.0''\,{\times}\,12.2''$) reveal a 75% excess CO(4-3) flux compared to the sum of individual sources detected in higher-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data ($1.0''\,{\times}\,0.8''$). Our work also reveals a similar result by tapering the ALMA data to $10''$. In contrast, the 3.2mm dust continuum shows little discrepancy between ACA and ALMA. A single-dish [CII] spectrum obtained by APEX/FLASH supports the ACA CO(4-3) result, revealing a large excess in [CII] emission relative to ALMA. The missing flux is unlikely due to undetected faint sources but instead suggests that high-resolution ALMA observations might miss extended and low-surface-brightness gas. Such emission could originate from the circum-galactic medium (CGM) or the pre-heated proto-intracluster medium (proto-ICM). If this molecular gas reservoir replenishes the star formation fuel, the overall depletion timescale will exceed 400Myr, reducing the requirement for the simultaneous SMG activity in SPT2349$-$56. Our results highlight the role of an extended gas reservoir in sustaining a high star formation rate (SFR) in SPT2349$-$56, and potentially establishing the ICM during the transition phase to a mature cluster.</description>

      <title>VEGAS-SSS: An intra-group component in the globular cluster system of NGC 5018 group of galaxies using VST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are fossil tracer of formation and evolution of galaxies and studying their properties provides crucial insights into past formation and interaction events. We study the properties of GC candidates in 1.25 $\times$ 1.03 sq. degrees area centred on NGC 5018 group of galaxies using deep, wide field and multi-band observations obtained with VST. We derived photometric catalogues of compact and extended sources and identified GC candidates using a set of photometric and morphometric selection parameters. A GC candidates catalogue is inspected using a statistical background decontamination technique. The 2D distribution map of GC candidates reveals an overdensity of sources on brightest member of group, NGC 5018. No significant GC overdensities are observed in other bright galaxies of group. We report discovery of a candidate local nucleated LSB dwarf galaxy possibly in tidal interaction with NGC 5018. The 2D map also reveals an intra-group GC population aligning with bright galaxies and along intra-group light component. Radial density profile of GC candidates in NGC 5018 follows galaxy surface brightness profile. Colour profile of GC candidates centred on this galaxy shows no evidence of well-known colour bimodality, which is instead observed in intra-group population. From GC luminosity function (GCLF) analysis, we find a low specific frequency $S_{\!\rm N}=0.59 \pm 0.27$ for NGC 5018, consistent with previous results. This relatively low $S_{\!\rm N}$ and lack of colour bimodality might be due to a combination of observational data limitations and the post-merger status of NGC 5018, which might host a population of relatively young GCs. For intra-group GC population, we obtain a lower limit of $S_{\!\rm {N,gr}}\sim0.6$. Using GCLF as a distance indicator, we estimate that NGC 5018 is located $38.0 \pm 7.9$ Mpc away, consistent with values in the literature..</description>

      <title>Bar instability and formation timescale across Toomre's $Q$ parameter and central mass concentration: slow bar formation or true stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bar formation process using $N$-body simulations across the Toomre's parameter $Q_{min}$ and central mass concentration (CMC), focusing principally on the formation timescale. Of importance is that, as suggested by cosmological simulations, disk galaxies have limited time of $\sim 8$ Gyr in the Universe timeline to evolve secularly, starting when they became physically and kinematically steady to prompt the bar instability. By incorporating this time limit, bar-unstable disks are further sub-divided into those that establish a bar before and after that time, namely the normal and the slowly bar-forming disks. Simulations demonstrate that evolutions of bar strengths and configurations of the slowly bar-forming and the bar-stable cases are nearly indistinguishable prior to $8$ Gyr, albeit dynamically distinct, while differences can be noticed afterwards. Differentiating them before $8$ Gyr is possible by identifying the proto-bar, a signature of bar development visible in kinematical maps such as the Fourier spectrogram and the angular velocity field, which emerges in the former group $1-2$ Gyr before the fully developed bar, whereas it is absent in the latter group until $8$ Gyr and such bar-stable disk remains unbarred until at least $10$ Gyr. In addition, we find complicated interplays between $Q_{min}$ and CMC in regulating the bar formation. Firstly, disk stabilization requires both high $Q_{min}$ and CMC. Either high $Q_{min}$ or high CMC only results in slow bar formation. Secondly, some hot disks can form a bar more rapidly than the colder ones in a specific range of $Q_{min}$ and CMC.</description>

      <title>Exploring variation of double-peak broad-line profile in strongly variable AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR) in AGNs are still unclear, which is crucial for studying the physics and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and AGNs. The broad-line profile provides valuable information on BLR geometry and kinematics. In this work, we explore the evolution of line profiles in variable AGNs based on the BLR model of Czerny \&amp; Hryniewicz, where the BLR is driven by the radiation pressure acting on dust at the surface layers of the accretion disk. The line profiles in the low-Eddington-ratio regime show a double-peak profile, which will become a single peak at high Eddington ratios. The high metallicity of $Z\gtrsim 5Z_{\odot}$ is required to reproduce the observational anti-correlation between the peak separation of broad lines and the Eddington ratio for a sample of AGNs. For the broad lines in variable AGNs, it will take several years to several decades to change their line profile if the disk luminosity suffers strong variation in a much shorter timescale. More monitoring of the broad line and continuum in strongly variable AGNs can shed special light on BLR physics.</description>

      <title>Spatial orientation and shape of the velocity ellipsoids of the Gaia DR3 giants and subgiants in the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of determining the parameters characterizing the shape and orientation of residual velocity ellipsoids from the Gaia DR3 red giants and subgiants. We show the distribution of velocity dispersions in the Galactic plane obtained from three components of the spatial velocity, as well as the coordinate distribution of the intersection points of the velocity ellipsoid axes with the celestial sphere, in particular the deviations of the longitudes and latitudes of the vertices of stellar regions located within spheres with a radius of 1 kpc centered in the Galactic mid-plane. The area of the Galactic disk under study is in the range of Galactocentric coordinates 0 &lt; R &lt; 15 kpc and $120^\circ &lt; \theta &lt; 240^\circ$. We show that the vertex deviations in some regions of the Galactic mid-plane can reach $30^\circ$ in longitude, and $15^\circ$ in latitude. This indicates the presence of kinematic distortions of the stellar velocity field, especially noticeable in the angular range of $150^\circ &lt; \theta &lt; 210^\circ$ at a distance of approximately 13 kpc. We propose the angles of deviation of longitudes and latitudes of the ellipsoid axes of residual stellar velocities to be considered as kinematic signatures of various Galactic deformations determined from real fields of spatial velocities. We present the distribution of parameters characterizing the shapes of velocity ellipsoids, as well as their distribution of the semi-axes length ratios. We note a local feature in this distribution and in the distribution of the elongation measurements of the ellipsoids. We perform a comparison of the results obtained from the tensor of deformation velocities and from the observed spatial velocities.</description>

      <title>Study of the physical and chemical properties of dense clumps at different evolutionary stages in several regions of massive star and stellar cluster formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars play an important role in the Universe. Unlike low-mass stars, the formation of these objects located at great distances is still unclear. It is expected to be governed by some combination of self-gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. In this work, we aim to study the chemical and physical conditions of dense clumps at different evolutionary stages. We performed observations towards 5 regions of massive star and stellar cluster formation (L1287, S187, S231, DR 21(OH), NGC 7538) with the IRAM-30m telescope. We covered the 2 and 3$-$4 mm wavelength bands and analysed the lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, HC$_3$N, HNCO, OCS, CS, SiO, SO$_2$, and SO. Using astrodendro algorithm on the 850 $\mu$m dust emission data from the SCUBA Legacy catalogue, we determined the masses, H$_2$ column densities, and sizes of the clumps. Furthermore, the kinetic temperatures, molecular abundances, and dynamical state were obtained. The Red Midcourse Space Experiment Source survey (RMS) was used to determine the clump types. A total of 20 clumps were identified. Three clumps were found to be associated with the Hii regions, 10 with young stellar objects (YSOs), and 7 with submillimetre emission. The clumps have typical sizes of about 0.2 pc and masses from 1 to 10$^{2}\,M_\odot$, kinetic temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 K and line widths of $\rm H^{13}CO^{+} (1-0)$ approximately 2 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$. We found no significant correlation in the line width$-$size and the line width$-$mass relationships. However, a strong correlation is observed in mass$-$size relationships. The virial analysis indicated that three clumps are gravitationally bound. Furthermore, we suggested that magnetic fields of about 1 mG provide additional support for clump stability. The molecular abundances relative to H$_2$ are approximately $10^{-10}-10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089: II. Jet-BLR Connection and Black Hole Mass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, displaying periods of flaring activity. This study explores its spectral variability over a decade. By employing the non-thermal dominance parameter, we analyze the H$\beta$ and $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ continuum light curves, as well as the full width at half maximum of the H$\beta$ emission line, to identify whether the primary source of the continuum emission is the accretion disk or the jet during activity periods. Our results shows an anti-correlation between the full width at half maximum and the luminosity of the H$\beta$ emission line across all datasets. This indicates, that variations in H$\beta$ luminosity consistently reflects the canonical broad-line region, irrespective of whether the primary ionizing source is the accretion disk or the jet. The anti-correlation persisted when comparing the full width at half maximum of H$\beta$ against the luminosity at $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ in the disk dominance regime. These findings, along with the observation that flaring events in the $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ continuum, attributed to the jet, coincide with flares in the H$\beta$ emission line, suggest that the base of the jet is located within the broad-line region. Based on the 219 spectra within the disk dominance regime, we estimated a mean black hole mass of $M_{BH}=2.85\pm0.37\times10^{8}\: M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Red supergiant stars in binary systems II. Confirmation of B-type companions of red supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud using Hubble ultra-violet spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiant stars (RSGs) represent the final evolutionary phase of the majority of massive stars and hold a unique role in testing the physics of stellar models. Eighty eight RSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) were recently found to have an ultra-violet excess that was attributed to a B-type companion. We present follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) ultra-violet (1700 -- 3000\,\AA) spectroscopy for 16 of these stars to investigate the nature of the UV excess and confirm the presence of a hot companion. In all cases we are able to confirm that the companion is a main-sequence B-type star based on the near-UV continuum. We determine effective temperatures, radii and luminosities from fitting the UV continuum with TLUSTY models and find stellar parameters in the expected range of SMC B-type stars. We display these results on a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram and assess the previously determined stellar parameters using UV photometry alone. From this comparison we conclude that UV photometric surveys are vital to identify such companions and UV spectroscopy is similarly vital to characterise the hot companions. From a comparison with IUE spectra of 32 Cyg, a well known RSG binary system in the Galaxy, four targets display evidence of being embedded in the wind of the RSG, like 32 Cyg, although none to the more extreme extent of VV Cep. The ages of six targets, determined via the stellar parameters of the hot companions, are found to be in tension with the ages determined for the RSG. A solution to this problem could be binary mass-transfer or red straggler stars.</description>

Abstract: This study presents the detection of a high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365 based on observational data obtained by \emph{XMM-Newton} in January 2004. Utilizing the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) methods, a QPO signal is identified at a frequency of $2.19 \times 10^{-4}\ {\rm Hz}$ (4566 s), with a confidence level of 3.6\ $\sigma$. The signal is notably absent in the lower 0.2 -- 1.0 keV energy band, with the primary contribution emerging from the 2.0 -- 10.0 keV band, where the confidence level reaches 3.9 $\sigma$. Spectral analysis shows that there are multiple absorption and emission lines in the high-energy band (&gt; 6\ keV). The correlation between the QPO frequency ($f_{\rm QPO}$) and the mass of the central black hole ($M_{\rm BH}$) of NGC 1365 aligns with the established logarithmic trend observed across black holes, indicating the QPO is of high frequency. This discovery provides new clues for studying the generation mechanism of QPOs in Seyfert galaxies, which helps us understand the accretion process around supermassive black holes and the characteristics of strong gravitational fields in active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02664</link>

Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at $z &gt; 2.3$, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>How Many Bursts Does it Take to Form a Core at the Center of a Galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for systematically assessing the impact of central potential fluctuations associated with bursty outflows on the structure of dark matter halos for dwarf and ultra-faint galaxies. Specifically, we use dark-matter-only simulations augmented with a manually-added massive particle that modifies the central potential and approximately accounts for a centrally-concentrated baryon component. This approach enables precise control over the magnitude, frequency, and timing of when rapid outflow events occur. We demonstrate that this method can reproduce the established result of core formation for systems that undergo multiple episodes of bursty outflows. In contrast, we also find that equivalent models that undergo only a single (or small number of) burst episodes do not form cores with the same efficacy. This is important because many ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies in the local universe are observed to have tightly constrained star formation histories that are best described by a single, early burst of star formation. Using a suite of cosmological, zoom-in simulations, we identify the regimes in which single bursts can and cannot form a cored density profile, and therefore, can or cannot resolve the core-cusp problem.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Chemistry II: "direct" $T_e$-based metallicity of galaxies at 3 $&lt; z &lt;$ 10 with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15435</link>

Abstract: We report the detection of the [O III] auroral line in 42 galaxies within the redshift range of $3 &lt; z &lt; 10$. These galaxies were selected from publicly available JWST data releases, including the JADES and PRIMALsurveys, and observed using both the low-resolution PRISM/CLEAR configuration and medium-resolution gratings. The measured electron temperatures in the high-ionization regions of these galaxies range from $T_e$([O III]) = 12,000 to 24,000 K, consistent with temperatures observed in local metal-poor galaxies and previous JWST studies. In 10 galaxies, we also detect the [O II] auroral line, allowing us to determine electron temperatures in the low-ionization regions, which range between $T_e$([O II]) = 10,830 and 20,000 K. The direct-$T_e$-based metallicities of our sample span from 12 + log(O/H) = 7.2 to 8.4, indicating these high-redshift galaxies are relatively metal-poor. By combining our sample with 25 galaxies from the literature, we expand the dataset to a total of 67 galaxies within $3 &lt; z &lt; 10$, effectively more than doubling the previous sample size for direct-$T_e$ based metallicity studies. This larger dataset allow us to derive empirical metallicity calibration relations based exclusively on high-redshift galaxies, using six key line ratios: R3, R2, R23, Ne3O2, O32, and O3N2. Notably, we derive a novel metallicity calibration relation for the first time using high-redshift $T_e$-based metallicities: $\hat{R}$ = 0.18log $R2$ + 0.98log $R3$. This new calibration significantly reduces the scatter in high-redshift galaxies compared to the $\hat{R}$ relation previously calibrated for low-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Bulge Oscillation Driven by Outflows of Active Galactic Nuclei. I. Fast Outflow Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing evidence for star formation inside outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The formed stars are injected into bulges and give rise to perturbation of bulges. In this paper, we investigate the issues of non-rotating, spherically symmetric bulges under the perturbation of fast, massive outflows with stars formed inside. We show that the potential perturbation of outflows together with injection and dynamical friction of these stars could drive bulge oscillations. Still, we find non-zero radial velocity of bulges will be driven by the episodic outflows of AGNs and after the AGN quenched, the radial velocity will tend to zero within a timescale $\sim\tau_{\rm AGN}$, which is the AGN's lifetime. For some typical values of bulges and AGNs, we find the expansion and contraction velocities are of a few $10\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ for $10^{10}\,M_\odot$ bulges and mass outflowing rate $500\,M_\odot/\rm yr$, which would give observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The overwhelming noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising a 30-day inspiral phase signal. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for a 30-day inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our absolute prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97% of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. The resulting precisions are 20% for ages, 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for masses, 0.01 $R_{\odot}$ for radii and 0.1 dex for surface gravities. These accurate parameters are expected to provide valuable insights for future studies on various fields.</description>

      <title>Warped accretion disks and quasars with episodic periodicity of long-term variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been found that some quasars are undergoing quasi-periodic variations (most of them with damped amplitudes) in optical bands from long-term monitoring campaigns, but how to explain the origin of such light curve variations still remains an open question. In this paper, we use the warped accretion disks model to explain the quasi-periodical variations. This model employs a free-bending wave traveling in an accretion disk which causes the orientation of the central part of the disk to oscillate from the line of sight, resulting in a quasi-periodical variation. We numerically solve the governing equation of warp propagation and calculate the simulated R-band light curves, finding that the periodical light curves generated by this model have damped amplitudes. To compare with observations, we select SDSSJ134820.42+194831.5 as a preliminary example from a sample of periodic quasar candidates by combining CRTS with other public survey data, and fitted its light curve with different observational angles. Our result gives a reduced $\chi^{2}\simeq 2.4$, implying that the model might give insights to future application of warped disk model.</description>
