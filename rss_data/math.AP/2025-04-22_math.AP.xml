      <title>On the wave turbulence theory of 2D gravity waves, II: propagation of randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of our work initiating the rigorous study of wave turbulence for water waves equations. We combine energy estimates, normal forms, and probabilistic and combinatorial arguments to complete the construction of long-time solutions with random initial data for the 2d (1d interface) gravity water waves system on large tori.
  This is the first long-time regularity result for solutions of water waves systems with large energy (but small local energy), which is the correct setup for applications to wave turbulence. Such a result is only possible in the presence of randomness.</description>

      <title>Existence and analyticity of solutions of nonlinear parabolic model equations with singular data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore two approaches to proving existence and analyticity of solutions to nonlinear parabolic differential equations. One of these methods works well for more general nonlinearities, while the second method gives stronger results when the nonlinearity is simpler. The first approach uses the exponentially weighted Wiener algebra, and is related to prior work of Duchon and Robert for vortex sheets. The second approach uses two norms, one with a supremum in time and one with an integral in time, with the integral norm representing the parabolic gain of regularity. As an example of the first approach we prove analyticity of small solutions of a class of generalized one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, which model the motion of flame fronts and other phenomena. To illustrate the second approach, we prove existence and analyticity of solutions of the dissipative Constantin-Lax-Majda equation (which models vortex stretching), with and without added advection, with two classes of rough data. The classes of data treated include both data in the Wiener algebra with negative-power weights, as well as data in pseudomeasure spaces with negative-power weights.</description>

      <title>Brouwer degree for Chern-Simons Higgs models on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a finite connected graph, where $V$ denotes the set of vertices and $E$ denotes the set of edges. We revisit the following Chern-Simons Higgs
  model,
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta u=\lambda \mathrm{e}^u\left(\mathrm{e}^u-1\right)+f \ \text {in} \ V,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Delta$ is the graph Laplacian, $\lambda$ is a real number and $f$ is a function defined on $V$. Firstly, when $\lambda \int_V f \mathrm{d} \mu \neq 0$, we find that the odevity of the number of vertices in the graph affects the number of solutions. Then by calculating the topological degree and using the relationship between the degree and the critical group of a related functional, we obtain the existence of multiple solutions. Also we study the existence of solutions when $\lambda \int_V f \mathrm{d} \mu=0$. These findings extend the work of Huang
  et al. [Comm Math Phys 377:613-621 (2020)], Hou and Sun [Calc Var 61:139 (2022)] and Li et al. [Calc Var 63:81 (2024)]. Similarly, for the generalized Chern-Simons Higgs model, we obtain the same results. Moreover, this method is also applied to the Chern-Simons Higgs system, yielding partial results for the existence of multiple solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where it has been concluded that an equation on graphs can have at least three distinct solutions. We think that our results will be valuable for studying the multiplicity of solutions to analogous equations on graphs.</description>

      <title>Local Behavior of Fractional Equations in Grushin-type Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the
  De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory for a wide class of nonlinear equations driven by nonlocal, possibly degenerate, integro-differential operators, with the fractional $p$-Laplacian operator in Grushin-type spaces $\mathbb{G}^n$ serving as a prototypical example. Among other results, we prove that the weak solutions to this class of problems are both bounded and H\"{o}lder continuous, while also establishing general estimates, such as fractional Caccioppoli-type estimates with tail terms and logarithmic-type bounds.</description>

      <title>Analysis of stochastic fluid-rigid body dynamics: an approach by stochastic maximal regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates for the first time a rigorous mathematical framework for a stochastic fluid-rigid body interaction problem. It is shown that the coupled problem of a rigid ball immersed in a Newtonian fluid filling the entire $\mathbb{R}^3$ and subject to additive noise in the fluid and rigid body equation as well as transport noise in the fluid equation is locally strongly well-posed. In addition, blow-up criteria for the stochastic fluid-rigid body interaction problem are provided. For these results, the boundedness of the $\mathcal{H}^\infty$-calculus of the so-called fluid-structure operator is established by means of a decoupling approach, paving the way for stochastic maximal regularity. The local strong well-posedness is then obtained by the theory of stochastic evolution equations in weighted spaces.</description>

      <title>Stratification and Rectifiability of Harmonic Map Flows via Tangent Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stratification theory for suitable solutions of harmonic map flows based on the spatial symmetry of tangent measures. Generally, suitable solutions are a category of solutions that satisfy both the localized energy inequality and the monotonicity formula. Building on the modifications and adjustments of quantitative stratifications and Reifenberg-rectifiable theory by Naber and Valtorta, we confirm that each stratum in our model is rectifiable. We also establish an estimate for the Minkowski content of the singular set at each time slice, demonstrating that the singular set is rectifiable and that our results strengthen previous findings, which were limited to almost every time slice. Furthermore, under certain assumptions about the target manifolds that exclude specific tangent flows and measures, our analysis achieves substantial improvements in the regularity of suitable solutions for harmonic map flows.</description>

      <title>Hilbert expansion of the Boltzmann equation on a 2-dimensional disk with specular boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we concern the hydrodynamic limit of Boltzmann equation with specular reflection boundary condition in a two-dimensional disk to the compressible Euler equations. Due to the non-zero curvature and non-zero tangential velocity of compressible Euler solution on the boundary, new difficulties arise in the construction of Knudsen boundary layer. By employing the geometric correction, and an innovative and refined $L^2-L^\infty$ method, we establish the existence and space-decay for a truncated Knudsen boundary layer. Then, by the Hilbert expansion of multi-scales, we successfully justify the hydrodynamic limit of Boltzmann equation with specular reflection boundary condition to the compressible Euler equations in the two-dimensional disk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the Cauchy problem for the reaction-diffusion equation with time-dependent absorption $u_{t}-\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u=- k(t)u^p$ posed on $\mathbb{H}^n$, driven by the Heisenberg Laplacian and supplemented with a nonnegative integrable initial data, where $p&gt;1$, $n\geq 1$, and $k:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ is a locally integrable function. We study the large time behavior of non-negative solutions and show that the nonlinear term determines the large time asymptotic for $p\leq 1+2/Q,$ while the classical/anomalous diffusion effects win if $p&gt;1+{2}/{Q}$, where $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^n$.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear problems with mixed local-nonlocal operator and concave-critical nonlinearities: Multiplicity of positive solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for the following concave-critical problem driven by an operator of mixed order obtained by the sum of the classical $p$-Laplacian and of the fractional $p$-Laplacian, \begin{equation}\tag{$\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$}
  -\Delta_p u+\varepsilon(-\Delta_p)^s u=\lambda|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{p^*-2}u \;\text{ in }\Omega,\quad
  u=0 \; \text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega, \end{equation} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded open set, $\epsilon\in(0,1]$, $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;q&lt;p&lt;N$, and $p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is a parameter. For $\lambda \leq 0$, we show that (\textcolor{blue}{$\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$}) has no nontrivial solution. For $\lambda&gt;0$, we prove Ambrosetti-Brezis-Cerami type results. In particular, we prove the existence of $\Lambda_\varepsilon$ such that (\textcolor{blue}{$\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$}) has a positive minimal solution for $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\Lambda_\varepsilon$, a positive solution for $\lambda=\Lambda_\varepsilon$ and no positive solution for $\lambda&gt;\Lambda_\varepsilon$. We also prove the existence of $0&lt;\lambda^\#\leq\Lambda_\varepsilon$ such that (\textcolor{blue}{$\mathcal{P}_{\lambda,\varepsilon}$}) has at least two positive solutions for $\lambda\in(0,\lambda^\#)$ provided $\varepsilon$ small enough. This extends the recent result of Biagi and Vecchi (Nonlinear Anal. 256 (2025),113795), Amundsen, et al. (Commun. Pure Appl. Anal., 22(10):3139-3164, 2023) from $p=2$ to the general $1&lt;p&lt;N$. Additionally, it extends the classical result of Azorero and Peral (Indiana Univ. Math. J., 43(3):947-957, 1994) to the mixed local-nonlocal quasilinear problems. Moreover, our results complements the multiplicity results for nonnegative solutions in da Silva, et al. (J. Differential Equations, 408:494-536, 2024).</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion approximation of nonlocal interactions in high-dimensional Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In various phenomena such as pattern formation, neural firing in the brain and cell migration, interactions that can affect distant objects globally in space can be observed. These interactions are referred to as nonlocal interactions and are often modeled using spatial convolution with an appropriate integral kernel. Many evolution equations incorporating nonlocal interactions have been proposed. In such equations, the behavior of the system and the patterns it generates can be controlled by modifying the shape of the integral kernel. However, the presence of nonlocality poses challenges for mathematical analysis. To address these difficulties, we develop an approximation method that converts nonlocal effects into spatially local dynamics using reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present an approximation method for nonlocal interactions in evolution equations based on a linear sum of solutions to a reaction-diffusion system in high-dimensional Euclidean space up to three dimensions. The key aspect of this approach is identifying a class of integral kernels that can be approximated by a linear combination of specific Green functions in the case of high-dimensional spaces. This enables us to demonstrate that any nonlocal interactions can be approximated by a linear sum of auxiliary diffusive substances. Our results establish a connection between a broad class of nonlocal interactions and diffusive chemical reactions in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Maze-Bubble Pattern Magnetic Domain Simulation Based on the Lengyel-Epstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is based on the Lengyel-Epstein (LE) model, governed by a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, to simulate the maze-bubble pattern magnetic domains in magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through numerical simulations, we successfully reproduce the maze, bubble, and intermediate-state magnetic domains observed in PMA multilayer films under the influence of material thickness and external magnetic fields. The topological structures of the magnetic domains shown in the simulation closely resemble those observed under a microscope, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LE model in simulating changes in the magnetic domain topology of magnetic thin films. This study also innovatively applies the concept of reaction-diffusion, commonly used in biochemistry, by drawing an analogy to electromagnetism. This approach holds significant implications for the study of magnetic domains.</description>

      <title>Time discretization in convected linearized thermo-visco-elastodynamics at large displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fully-implicit time discretization (i.e. the backward Euler formula) is applied to compressible nonlinear dynamical models of thermo-viscoelastic solids in the Eulerian description, i.e. in the actual deforming configuration, formulated in terms of rates. The Kelvin-Voigt rheology or also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology (covering creep or plasticity) are considered, using the additive Green-Naghdi's decomposition of total strain into the elastic and the inelastic strains formulated in terms of (objective) rates exploiting the Zaremba-Jaumann time derivative. A linearized convective model at large displacements is considered, focusing on the case where the internal energy additively splits the (convex) mechanical and the thermal parts. The time-discrete suitably regularized scheme is devised. The numerical stability and, considering the multipolar 2nd-grade viscosity, also convergence towards weak solutions are proved, exploiting the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum instead of velocity and estimating the temperature gradient from the entropy-like inequality.</description>

      <title>Convex capillary hypersurfaces of prescribed curvature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the prescribed $k$-th Weingarten curvature problem for convex capillary hypersurfaces in $\overline{\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+}$. This problem naturally extends the prescribed $k$-th Weingarten curvature problem for closed convex hypersurfaces, previously investigated by Guan-Guan in [19], to the capillary setting. We reformulate the problem as the solvability of a Hessian quotient equation with a Robin boundary condition on a spherical cap. Under a natural sufficient condition, we establish the existence of a strictly convex capillary hypersurface with the prescribed $k$-th Weingarten curvature. This also extends our recent work on the capillary Minkowski problem in [40].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of tokens through a deep transformer models can be modeled as an interacting particle system that has been shown to exhibit an asymptotic clustering behavior akin to the synchronization phenomenon in Kuramoto models. In this work, we investigate the long-time clustering of mean-field transformer models. More precisely, we establish exponential rates of contraction to a Dirac point mass for any suitably regular initialization under some assumptions on the parameters of transformer models, any suitably regular mean-field initialization synchronizes exponentially fast with some quantitative rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study nonlinear superpositions of Riemann wave solutions admitted by quasilinear hyperbolic first-order systems of partial differential equations. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of non-elastic wave superpositions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise independent interactions of waves (quasi-rectifiability). In the case of the compressible Euler system, we describe the structure of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields associated with waves. We prove that a certain class of Lie modules associated with a hydrodynamic-type systems can be uniquely transformed into a real Lie algebra in an angle-preserving manner. For the Euler system, we then demonstrate the connection between the transformed finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the infinite-dimensional algebra associated with waves. This enables a detailed investigation of the geometry of wave superpositions using tools from differential geometry and Lie group theory. In particular, we study the geometry of the manifold of wave superpositions in terms of deformations of submanifolds corresponding to Lie subalgebras associated with waves. Additionally, we present new methods and criteria for determining the quasi-rectifiability of Riemann k-waves.</description>

      <title>Approximate factorizations for non-symmetric jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first extend the approximate factorization for purely discontinuous Markov process established in \cite{CKSV20} by getting rid of some of the conditions imposed in \cite{CKSV20}. Then we apply the approximate factorization to obtain two-sided heat kernel estimates for three classes of processes: stable-like processes with critical killings in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets; killed stable-like processes in the setting of \cite{KW24} in $C^{1, \varepsilon}$ open sets; and non-symmetric stable processes in what we call $C^{1,2{\text - \rm Dini}}$ open sets. In particular, we obtain explicit sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates of killed $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and of censored $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1, {\rm Dini}}$ open sets for all $\alpha\in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the author establishes a wavelet characterization of inhomogeneous Lipschitz space $\mathrm{lip}_{\theta}(\mathcal{X})$ via Carlson sequence, where $\mathcal{X}$ is a space of homogeneous type introduced by R. R. Coifman and G. Weiss. As applications, characterizations of several geometric conditions on $\mathcal{X}$, involving the upper bound, the lower bound, and the Ahlfors regular condition, are obtained.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Splitting Theorem for the $N$-Bakry \'Emery Ricci tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the spectral generalization of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem to smooth metric measure space. We show that if a complete non-compact weighted Riemannian manifold $(M,g,e^{-f}\,dvolg)$ of dimension $n\ge 2$ has at least two ends where $f$ is smooth and bounded. If there is some $N\in (0,\infty)$ such that $$\lambda_1(\gamma \Delta_f+\operatorname{Ric}^N_f)\ge 0$$ for some $\gamma&lt;\left(\frac{1}{(n-1)\left(1 + \frac{n-1}{N}\right)} + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)^{-1}$, then $M$ splits isometrically as $\mathbb{R}\times X$ for some complete Riemannian manifold $X$ with $(\operatorname{Ric}_X)^N_f\ge 0$. The estimate can recover the spectral splitting result and its sharp constant $\frac{4}{n-1}$ in Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu and and Catino--Mari--Mastrolia--Roncoroni.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the pioneering work [Merle, Rapha\"el, Rodnianski, and Szeftel, Ann. of Math., 196(2):567-778, 2022, Ann. of Math., 196(2):779-889, 2022, Invent. Math., 227(1):247-413, 2022] we construct exact, smooth self-similar imploding solutions to the 3D isentropic compressible Euler equations for ideal gases for all adiabatic exponents $\gamma&gt;1$. For the particular case $\gamma=\frac75$ (corresponding to a diatomic gas, e.g. oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen), akin to the previous result, we show the existence of a sequence of smooth, self-similar imploding solutions. In addition, we provide simplified proofs of linear stability and non-linear stability, which allow us to construct asymptotically self-similar imploding solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density independent viscosity for the case $\gamma=\frac75$. Moreover, the solutions constructed have density bounded away from zero and converge to a constant at infinity, representing the first example of singularity formation in such a setting.</description>

      <title>On the wave turbulence theory of 2D gravity waves, I: deterministic energy estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to initiate the rigorous investigation of wave turbulence and derivation of wave kinetic equations (WKE) for water waves models. This problem has received intense attention in recent years in the context of semilinear models, such as semilinear Schr\"odinger equations or multi-dimensional KdV-type equations. However, our situation here is different since the water waves equations are quasilinear and the solutions cannot be constructed by iteration of the Duhamel formula due to unavoidable derivative loss. This is the first of two papers in which we design a new strategy to address this issue, in the context of 2D gravity waves.</description>

Abstract: We consider the construction of linear instability of parallel shear flows, which was developed by Zhiwu Lin (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 35(2), 2003). We give an alternative simple proof in Sobolev setting of the problem, which exposes the mathematical role of the Plemelj-Sochocki formula in the emergence of the instability, as well as does not require the cone condition. Moreover, we localize this approach to obtain an approximation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of a flat vortex sheet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct $d$-dimensional polyhedral chains such that the distribution of tangent planes is close to a prescribed measure on the Grassmannian and the chains are either cycles (if the barycenter of the prescribed measure, considered as a measure on $\bigwedge^d \mathbb{R}^n$, is $0$) or their boundary is the boundary of a unit $d$-cube (if the barycenter of the prescribed measure is a simple $d$-vector). Such fillings were first proved to exist by Burago and Ivanov [Geom. funct. anal., 2004]; our work gives an explicit construction, which is also flexible to generalizations. For instance, in the case that the measure on the Grassmannian is supported on the set of positively oriented $d$-planes, we can construct fillings that are Lipschitz multigraphs. We apply this construction to prove the surprising fact that, for anisotropic integrands, polyconvexity is equivalent to quasiconvexity of the associated $Q$-integrands (that is, ellipticity for Lipschitz multigraphs) and to show that strict polyconvexity is necessary for the atomic condition to hold.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Inequalities for Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations via the Alexandroff-Bakelman-Pucci Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we establish eigenvalue inequalities for elliptic differential operators either for Dirichlet or for Robin eigenvalue problems, by using the technique introduced by Alexandroff, Bakelman and Pucci. These inequalities can be extended for fully nonlinear elliptic equations, such as for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation and for Pucci's equations. As an application we establish a lower bound for the $ L^p -$norm of the Laplacian and this bound is sharp, in the sense that, when equality is achieved then a symmetry property is obtained. In addition, we obtain an $ L^{\infty} $ bound for the gradient of solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations and as a result, a $ C^3 $ estimate.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Stokes conjecture for compressible gravity water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1880, Stokes examined an incompressible irrotational periodic traveling water wave under the influence of gravity and conjectured the existence of an extreme wave with a corner of $120^{\circ}$ at the crest. The first rigorous proof of the conjecture was given by Amick, Fraenkel and Toland, as well as by Plotnikov independently via the Nekrasov integral equation. In the early 2010s, Weiss and Varvarucva revisited the conjecture by applying a new geometric method, which provided an affirmative answer to the conjecture without requiring structural assumptions such as the isolation of the stagnation points, the symmetry and the monotonicity of the free surface that were necessary in the previous works.
  The main purpose of this paper is to establish the validity of the Stokes conjecture in the context of compressible gravity water waves. More precisely, we prove that a sharp crest forms near each stagnation point of a compressible gravity water wave with an included angle of $120^{\circ}$, which gives a first proof to the compressible counterpart of the classical conjecture by Stokes in 1880.
  The central aspect of our approach is the discovery of a new monotonicity formula for quasilinear free boundary problems of the Bernoulli-type. Another observation is the introduction of a new nonlinear frequency formula, along with a compensated compactness argument for the compressible Euler system. The developed monotonicity formula enables us to do blow-up analysis at each stagnation point and helps us obtain the singular profile of the free surface near each stagnation points. The degenerate stagnation points can be further analyzed with the help of the compensated compactness argument using the frequency formula.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and relaxation for solutions of the Fokker-Planck-Alignment equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove global existence of weak solutions, their regularization, and global relaxation to Maxwellian for a broad class of Fokker-Planck-Alignment models which appear in collective dynamics. The main feature of these results, as opposed to previously known ones, is the lack of regularity or no-vacuum requirements on the initial data. With a particular application to the classical kinetic Cucker-Smale model, we demonstrate that any bounded data with finite energy, $(1+ |v|^2) f_0 \in L^1$, $f_0 \in L^\infty$, and finite higher moment $|v|^q f\in L^2$, $q \gg 2$, gives rise to a global instantly smooth solution, satisfying entropy equality and relaxing exponentially fast.
  The results are achieved through the use of a new thickness-based renormalization, which circumvents the problem of degenerate diffusion in non-perturbative regime.</description>

Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

The primary objective of this paper is to present a global compactness result that offers a complete characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences of the energy functional associated with \eqref{MAT1}. Using this characterization, within a certain range of $s$, we establish the existence of a solution with negative energy for \eqref{MAT1} when $\ker(f)=\ker(g)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers simultaneous homogenization dimension reduction of a poroelastic model for thin fiber-reinforced hydrogels. The analysed medium is defined as a two-component system consisting of a continuous fiber framework with hydrogel inclusions arranged periodically throughout. The fibers are assumed to operate under quasi-stationary linear elasticity, whereas the hydrogel's hydromechanical behavior is represented using Biot's linear poroelasticity model. The asymptotic limit of the coupled system is established when the periodicity and thickness parameters are of the same order and tend to zero simultaneously, utilizing the re-scaling unfolding operator. It is demonstrated that the limit displacement exhibits Kirchhoff-Love-type behavior using the decomposition of plate displacements. Towards the end, a unique solution for the macroscopic problem has been demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Stochastic Evolution Equations in the Critical Variational Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise. Since our framework includes the 2D Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations with gradient noise and unbounded domains, our results resolve an open problem that has remained unsolved for over 15 years.</description>

Abstract: This study addresses the inverse source problem for the fractional diffusion-wave equation, characterized by a source comprising spatial and temporal components. The investigation is primarily concerned with practical scenarios where data is collected subsequent to an incident. We establish the uniqueness of either the spatial or the temporal component of the source, provided that the temporal component exhibits an asymptotic expansion at infinity. Taking anomalous diffusion as a typical example, we gather the asymptotic behavior of one of the following quantities: the concentration on partial interior region or at a point inside the region, or the flux on partial boundary or at a point on the boundary. The proof is based on the asymptotic expansion of the solution to the fractional diffusion-wave equation. Notably, our approach does not rely on the conventional vanishing conditions for the source components. We also observe that the extent of uniqueness is dependent on the fractional order.</description>
