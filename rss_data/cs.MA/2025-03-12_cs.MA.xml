      <title>Enhancing Traffic Signal Control through Model-based Reinforcement Learning and Policy Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown significant potential in traffic signal control (TSC). However, current MARL-based methods often suffer from insufficient generalization due to the fixed traffic patterns and road network conditions used during training. This limitation results in poor adaptability to new traffic scenarios, leading to high retraining costs and complex deployment. To address this challenge, we propose two algorithms: PLight and PRLight. PLight employs a model-based reinforcement learning approach, pretraining control policies and environment models using predefined source-domain traffic scenarios. The environment model predicts the state transitions, which facilitates the comparison of environmental features. PRLight further enhances adaptability by adaptively selecting pre-trained PLight agents based on the similarity between the source and target domains to accelerate the learning process in the target domain. We evaluated the algorithms through two transfer settings: (1) adaptability to different traffic scenarios within the same road network, and (2) generalization across different road networks. The results show that PRLight significantly reduces the adaptation time compared to learning from scratch in new TSC scenarios, achieving optimal performance using similarities between available and target scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bearing-Only Target Pursuit via Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Design and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the multi-robot pursuit problem for an unknown target, encompassing both target state estimation and pursuit control. First, in state estimation, we focus on using only bearing information, as it is readily available from vision sensors and effective for small, distant targets. Challenges such as instability due to the nonlinearity of bearing measurements and singularities in the two-angle representation are addressed through a proposed uniform bearing-only information filter. This filter integrates multiple 3D bearing measurements, provides a concise formulation, and enhances stability and resilience to target loss caused by limited field of view (FoV). Second, in target pursuit control within complex environments, where challenges such as heterogeneity and limited FoV arise, conventional methods like differential games or Voronoi partitioning often prove inadequate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, enabling multiple heterogeneous vehicles to search, localize, and follow a target while effectively handling those challenges. Third, to bridge the sim-to-real gap, we propose two key techniques: incorporating adjustable low-level control gains in training to replicate the dynamics of real-world autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), and proposing spectral-normalized RL algorithms to enhance policy smoothness and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the successful zero-shot transfer of the MARL controllers to AGVs, validating the effectiveness and practical feasibility of our approach.

      <title>COLA: A Scalable Multi-Agent Framework For Windows UI Task Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of studies have leveraged LLMs as the cognitive core of agents to address complex task decision-making challenges. Specially, recent research has demonstrated the potential of LLM-based agents on automating Windows GUI operations. However, existing methodologies exhibit two critical challenges: (1) static agent architectures fail to dynamically adapt to the heterogeneous requirements of OS-level tasks, leading to inadequate scenario generalization;(2) the agent workflows lack fault tolerance mechanism, necessitating complete process re-execution for UI agent decision error. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{COLA}, a collaborative multi-agent framework for automating Windows UI operations. In this framework, a scenario-aware agent Task Scheduler decomposes task requirements into atomic capability units, dynamically selects the optimal agent from a decision agent pool, effectively responds to the capability requirements of diverse scenarios. The decision agent pool supports plug-and-play expansion for enhanced flexibility. In addition, we design a memory unit equipped to all agents for their self-evolution. Furthermore, we develop an interactive backtracking mechanism that enables human to intervene to trigger state rollbacks for non-destructive process repair. Our experimental results on the GAIA benchmark demonstrates that the \textit{COLA} framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average score of 31.89\%, significantly outperforming baseline approaches without web API integration. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of our dynamic scheduling. The code is available at https://github.com/Alokia/COLA-demo.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Cooperative Agents in Mean-Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to mean-field control (MFC) - the cooperative counterpart to mean-field games (MFGs) - and in particular to the setting where decentralised agents learn online from a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We adapt recent algorithms for MFGs to this new setting, as well as contributing a novel sub-routine allowing networked agents to estimate the global average reward from their local neighbourhood. We show that the networked communication scheme allows agents to increase social welfare faster than under both the centralised and independent architectures, by computing a population of potential updates in parallel and then propagating the highest-performing ones through the population, via a method that can also be seen as tackling the credit-assignment problem. We prove this new result theoretically and provide experiments that support it across numerous games, as well as exploring the empirical finding that smaller communication radii can benefit convergence in a specific class of game while still outperforming agents learning entirely independently. We provide numerous ablation studies and additional experiments on numbers of communication round and robustness to communication failures.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.</description>

      <title>Steering No-Regret Agents in MFGs under Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incentive design is a popular framework for guiding agents' learning dynamics towards desired outcomes by providing additional payments beyond intrinsic rewards. However, most existing works focus on a finite, small set of agents or assume complete knowledge of the game, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios involving large populations and model uncertainty. To address this gap, we study the design of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with density-independent transitions, where both the transition dynamics and intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This setting presents non-trivial challenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents to explore for its model learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer them to converge to desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments. Assuming agents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic exploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret guarantees for the cumulative gaps between the agents' behaviors and the desired ones. In terms of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total incentive payments incur only sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline steering strategy that stabilizes the target policy as an equilibrium. Our work presents an effective framework for steering agents behaviors in large-population systems under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Task Allocation for Multi-agent Systems via Unequal-dimensional Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a probabilistic model for large-scale task allocation problems for multi-agent systems, aiming to determine an optimal deployment strategy that minimizes the overall transport cost. Specifically, we assign transportation agents to delivery tasks with given pick-up and drop-off locations, pairing the spatial distribution of transport resources with the joint distribution of task origins and destinations. This aligns with the optimal mass transport framework where the problem and is in the unequal-dimensional setting. The task allocation problem can be thus seen as a linear programming problem that minimizes a quadratic transport cost functional, optimizing the energy of all transport units. The problem is motivated by time-sensitive medical deliveries using drones, such as emergency equipment and blood transport. In this paper, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and smoothness of the optimal solution, and illustrate its properties through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing QoE-Privacy Tradeoff for Proactive VR Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proactive virtual reality (VR) streaming requires users to upload viewpoint-related information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing strategies preserve privacy by introducing errors to viewpoints, which, however, compromises the quality of experience (QoE) of users. In this paper, we first delve into the analysis of the viewpoint leakage probability achieved by existing privacy-preserving approaches. We determine the optimal distribution of viewpoint errors that minimizes the viewpoint leakage probability. Our analyses show that existing approaches cannot fully eliminate viewpoint leakage. Then, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach that introduces noise to uploaded viewpoint prediction errors, which can ensure zero viewpoint leakage probability. Given the proposed approach, the tradeoff between privacy preservation and QoE is optimized to minimize the QoE loss while satisfying the privacy requirement. Simulation results validate our analysis results and demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a promising solution for balancing privacy and QoE.</description>

      <title>ReMA: Learning to Meta-think for LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Converging to Stability in Two-Sided Bandits: The Case of Unknown Preferences on Both Sides of a Matching Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of repeated two-sided matching with uncertain preferences (two-sided bandits), and no explicit communication between agents. Recent work has developed algorithms that converge to stable matchings when one side (the proposers or agents) must learn their preferences, but the preferences of the other side (the proposees or arms) are common knowledge, and the matching mechanism uses simultaneous proposals at each round. We develop new algorithms that provably converge to stable matchings for two more challenging settings: one where the arm preferences are no longer common knowledge, and a second, more general one where the arms are also uncertain about their preferences. In our algorithms, agents start with optimistic beliefs about arms' preferences and update these preferences over time. The key insight is in how to combine these beliefs about arm preferences with beliefs about the value of matching with an arm conditional on one's proposal being accepted when choosing whom to propose to.</description>

      <title>Exploring LLM Cryptocurrency Trading Through Fact-Subjectivity Aware Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many studies show that more advanced LLMs excel in tasks such as mathematics and coding, we observe that in cryptocurrency trading, stronger LLMs sometimes underperform compared to weaker ones. To investigate this counterintuitive phenomenon, we examine how LLMs reason when making trading decisions. Our findings reveal that (1) stronger LLMs show a preference for factual information over subjectivity; (2) separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components leads to higher profits. Building on these insights, we propose a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this fine-grained reasoning approach enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets, yielding profit improvements of 7\% in BTC, 2\% in ETH, and 10\% in SOL. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that relying on subjective news generates higher returns in bull markets, while focusing on factual information yields better results in bear markets.

      <title>Expected Return Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry is an important inductive bias that can improve model robustness and generalization across many deep learning domains. In multi-agent settings, a priori known symmetries have been shown to address a fundamental coordination failure mode known as mutually incompatible symmetry breaking; e.g. in a game where two independent agents can choose to move "left'' or "right'', and where a reward of +1 or -1 is received when the agents choose the same action or different actions, respectively. However, the efficient and automatic discovery of environment symmetries, in particular for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, remains an open problem. Furthermore, environmental symmetry breaking constitutes only one type of coordination failure, which motivates the search for a more accessible and broader symmetry class. In this paper, we introduce such a broader group of previously unexplored symmetries, which we call expected return symmetries, which contains environment symmetries as a subgroup. We show that agents trained to be compatible under the group of expected return symmetries achieve better zero-shot coordination results than those using environment symmetries. As an additional benefit, our method makes minimal a priori assumptions about the structure of their environment and does not require access to ground truth symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: XR devices running chat-bots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the to become always-on agents that enable much better productivity scenarios. Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.</description>
