      <title>Information bounds production in replicator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate minimal replicator systems that are able to use information in a functional manner. Specifically, we consider a population of autocatalytic replicators in a flow reactor, subject to fluctuating environments. We derive operational bounds on replicators production in terms of information-theoretic quantities, reflecting contributions from environmental uncertainty, side information, and distribution mismatch. We also derive the optimal strategy, expressed as a function of both intrinsic replicator parameters and environmental statistics. We compare and contrast our findings with existing information-theoretic formalisms such as Kelly gambling. The results are illustrated on a model of real-world self-assembled molecular replicators. For this system, we demonstrate the benefit of internal memory in environments with temporal correlations, and we propose a plausible experimental setup for detecting the signature of functional information. We briefly discuss the role that information processing may play in guiding the evolution of prebiotic replicator networks.</description>

      <title>How Honeybees Perceive and Traverse Apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to fly through openings in vegetation allows insects like bees to access otherwise unreachable food sources. The specific visual strategies employed by flying insects during aperture negotiation tasks remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the visual and geometric parameters of apertures that influence honeybee flight. We recorded honeybees flying through apertures with varying shapes and sizes using high-speed cameras to examine their spatial distribution patterns and trajectories during passage. Our results reveal that the flight of bees was, on average, along the bilateral center of the edges of the aperture irrespective of the size. When apertures were smaller, bees tended to also fly closer to the vertical center. However, for larger apertures, they traverse at lower vertical positions (closer to the bottom edge). The behaviors suggest that honeybees modulate their flight trajectories in response to spatial constraints, adjusting trajectory relative to aperture dimensions. When entering at off-center horizontal positions, bees tended to access the vertical center of the aperture, indicating altitude selection influenced by the curvature of the edge below. This behavior suggests an acute awareness of the vertical and horizontal spatial constraints and a preference for maintaining a curvature-dependent altitude that optimizes safe passage. Our analysis reveals that honeybees modulate speed and altitude above the ventral edge passing beneath them, maintaining a median ventral optic flow of 778 deg/s. This relationship suggests a control mechanism where bees rely on visual information in a narrow ventrally directed field to navigate safely through confined spaces.</description>

      <title>A Functional Human Liver Tissue Model: 3D Bioprinted Co-culture Discoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce costs and delays related to developing new and effective drugs, there is a critical need for improved human liver tissue models. Here we describe an approach for 3D bioprinting functional human liver tissue models, in which we fabricate disc-shaped structures (discoids) 200 {\mu}m in thickness and 1-3 mm in diameter, embedded in a highly permeable support medium made from packed microgels. We demonstrate that the method is precise, accurate, and scalable; up to 100 tissues per hour can be manufactured with a variability and error in diameter of about 4%. Histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation of printed discs reveal self-organization, cell cohesion, and key liver marker expression. During the course of 3-4 weeks in culture, the tissues stably synthesize albumin and urea at high levels, outperforming spheroid tissue models. We find the tissues express more than 100 genes associated with molecular absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) at levels within the range of human liver. The liver tissue models exhibit enzymatic formation of metabolites after exposure to multiple test compounds. Together, these results demonstrate the promise of 3D printed discoids for pharmacological and toxicological applications.</description>

      <title>A data-driven biophysical network model reproduces C. elegans premotor neural dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: C. elegans locomotion is composed of switches between forward and reversal states punctuated by turns. This locomotory capability is necessary for the nematode to move towards attractive stimuli, escape noxious chemicals, and explore its environment. Although experimentalists have identified a number of premotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons work together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood. Towards a better understanding of C. elegans neurodynamics, we present in this paper a minimally parameterized, biophysical dynamical systems model of the premotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of premotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and interneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is data-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows experimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome, and physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage clamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces premotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly random switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization of subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different roles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching dynamics. The model correctly predicts behavior such as dwelling versus roaming as a result of the synaptic inputs received, and we demonstrate that it can be used to study how the activity level of certain individual neurons impacts behavior.</description>

      <title>Mie scattering due to tissue structures in the terahertz regime: Experimental and Monte Carlo verification using diffused polarimetric imaging in highly attenuating tissue phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significance: Changes in the structure of tissue occur in many disease processes, such as the boundaries of cancerous tumors and burn injuries. Spectroscopic and polarimetric alterations of terahertz light caused by Mie scattering patterns has the potential to be a diagnostic marker.
  Aim: We present an analysis of Monte Carlo simulation of Mie scattering of polarized terahertz light from cancerous tumor budding, compare the simulation to experimental results obtained in phantom models, and present an analysis of a polarization-sensitive terahertz scan of an ex vivo porcine burn injury.
  Approach: Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we modeled the changes in diffuse intensity and degree of polarization of broadband off-specular terahertz light due to scattering particles in highly attenuating tissue. We extracted the Mueller matrix of the tissue using this model and analyzed the Lu-Chipman product decomposition matrices. We compared this model to experimental data from four phantoms consisting of polypropylene particles of varying sizes embedded in gelatin. Finally, we induced a full-thickness burn injury in ex vivo porcine skin samples and compared experimental data from burned and healthy regions of the tissue.
  Results: Simulation revealed contrast in the Stokes vectors and Mueller Matrix elements for varying scattering particle sizes. Experimental phantom results showed contrast between different sizes of scattering particles in degree of polarization and diffuse intensity in agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results. Finally, we demonstrated a similar diffused imaging signal contrast between burned and healthy regions of ex vivo porcine skin.
  Conclusion: Polarimetric terahertz imaging has the potential to detect structural changes due to biological disease processes.</description>

      <title>Swimming mode determines how well mesoscale swimmers shield their odor in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine organisms manipulate their surrounding flow through their swimming dynamics, which affects the transport of their own odor cues. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations how a group of mesoscale swimmers immersed in a turbulent flow alters the shape of the odor plume they release in the water. Odor mixing is enhanced by increased velocity fluctuations and a swimmer-induced flow circulation which widen the odor plume at close range while speeding up dilution of the chemical trace. Beyond a short-range increase in the likelihood of being detected, swimming considerably reduces detections with effects that can persist at distances of the order of ten times the size of the group or more. We find that puller-like swimmers are more effective at olfactory shielding than pusher-like swimmers. We trace this difference back to the dynamics at the swimmer location, which tends to trap odor at the source for pushers and to dilute it for pullers. Olfactory shielding is robust to changes in the conditions, and is more pronounced for weak turbulent Reynolds numbers and large swimmer Reynolds numbers. Our results suggest that olfactory shielding may play a role in the emergence of different swimming modalities by marine organisms.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics and Cyclic Memory Retrieval in Non-reciprocal Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Hopfield networks with non-reciprocal coupling inducing switches between memory patterns. Dynamical phase transitions occur between phases of no memory retrieval, retrieval of multiple point-attractors, and limit-cycle attractors. The limit cycle phase is bounded by two critical regions: a Hopf bifurcation line and a fold bifurcation line, each with unique dynamical critical exponents and sensitivity to perturbations. A Master Equation approach numerically verifies the critical behavior predicted analytically. We discuss how these networks could model biological processes near a critical threshold of cyclic instability evolving through multi-step transitions.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation Unifies Nonequilibrium Response Theory for Arbitrary Markov Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from unperturbed trajectory data, offering practical advantages for studying complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Imaging and Modeling of Ultra-Weak Photon Emission in Plants Under Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that effectively reflects the function and health status of plant cells. However, current UPE measurement techniques are limited by resolution and sensitivity, particularly when monitoring different plant species and stress types. This study analyzes the delayed luminescence (DL) properties of Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Arabidopsis leaves, and Ginkgo leaves under both stress and control conditions using an independently developed UPE imaging system. The results showed a significant increase in initial DL intensity and an accelerated oxidative metabolic rate under mechanical injury and oxidative stress. DL decay characteristics were significantly correlated with the plant's physiological state, with stress conditions exhibiting decay curves that closely matched theoretical models. These findings confirm the established correlation between DL and plant stress responses. The high-resolution, low-noise imaging system significantly improves the accuracy of plant physiological state monitoring and provides new insights into the potential of optical signals for non-chemical communication research and agricultural applications. This technology has great potential for monitoring plant growth, assessing environmental stress, and supporting precision agriculture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural properties of packed soft-core particles provide a platform to understand the cross-pollinated physical concepts in solid-state- and soft-matter physics. Confined on spherical surface, the traditional differential geometry also dictates the overall defect properties in otherwise regular crystal lattices. Using molecular dynamics simulation of the Hertzian model as a tool, we report here the emergence of new types of disclination patterns: domain and counter-domain defects, when hexagonal and square patterns coexist. A new angle is presented to understand the incompatibility between tiling lattice shapes and the available spherical areal shapes, which is common in nature -- from molecular systems in biology to backbone construction in architectures.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work occurring in various biological processes, the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of heated debate due to the involved tiny spatiotemporal scale. Here, we take a different path and choose to investigate how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction in silico. Utilizing a mechanics model developed for the structural unit of muscle that systematically integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our model's predictions are largely consistent with experimental data and our analysis suggests that a gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. We believe that this work can provide important insights into the kinetics and the function of Pi-release in the regulation of forces and motions generated by myosins for cellular processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.</description>

Abstract: Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.</description>
