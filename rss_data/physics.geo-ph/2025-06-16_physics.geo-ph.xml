      <title>Endo-exo classification of episodic rock creep in deep mines: Implications for forecasting catastrophic failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rock masses in deep underground environments under high in-situ stress often exhibit episodic creep behavior, driven by complex interactions between external perturbation and internal reorganization. The causes of these creep episodes and their link to potential catastrophic failure remain poorly understood. Here, we present a novel 'endo-exo' framework for analyzing episodic rock creep in deep underground mines, capturing the interplay between exogenous triggers (e.g., blasting and excavation) and endogenous processes (e.g., damage and healing within rock masses). The underlying physical mechanism involves cascades of locally triggered rock block movements due to fracturing and sliding. We identify four fundamental types of episodic dynamics, classified by the origin of disturbance (endogenous or exogenous) and the level of criticality (subcritical or critical). All four types exhibit power law relaxations with distinct exponents: 1+\theta (exogenous subcritical), 1-\theta (exogenous critical), 1-2\theta (endogenous critical) and 0 (endogenous subcritical), all governed by a single parameter 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1. Our theoretical predictions are examined using the comprehensive dataset of a platinum mine in South Africa, where stopes display episodic closure behavior during successive mining operations. All creep episodes recorded can be accounted for in our classification with \theta \approx 0.35\pm0.1, providing strong validation of our theory. This \theta value is interpreted in terms of a first-passage process driven by anomalous stress diffusion, represented by fractional Brownian motion or L\'{e}vy-type processes. Finally, we offer new insights into endo-exo interactions and the system's transition from episodic creep to catastrophic failure, with important implications for forecasting large-scale panel collapses.</description>

      <title>Barchans interacting with dune-size obstacles: details of the fluid flow and motion of grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate details of the interaction of subaqueous barchans with dune-size obstacles by carrying out numerical simulations where the fluid is solved at the grain scale and the motions of individual grains are computed at all time steps. With the outputs, we analyze the disturbances of the fluid flow, the trajectories of grains, and the resultant force on each grain, the latter being unfeasible from experiments and field measurements. We show that in some cases particles pass over the obstacle, while in others they completely circumvent it (without touching it), or are even blocked. For the circumvention and blocking cases, which we call bypass and trapped, respectively, we show the existence of a strong vortex between the lee face of the dune and the obstacle. This vortex results from the interactions of recirculation regions and horseshoe vortices, and has enough strength to deviate the main flow and carry grains around the obstacle in those cases. Our results shed light on the reasons for passing over, circumventing, and blocking, and contribute to our understanding of dunes in the presence of large obstacles such as hills, crater rims, and human constructions.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling of seismic data using diffusion models and its application to multi-purpose posterior sampling for noisy inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geophysical inverse problems are often ill-posed and admit multiple solutions. Conventional discriminative methods typically yield a single deterministic solution, which fails to model the posterior distribution, cannot generate diverse high-quality stochastic solutions, and limits uncertainty quantification. Addressing this gap, we propose an unsupervised posterior sampling method conditioned on the noisy observations and the inverse problem, eliminating the need to retrain a task-specific conditional diffusion model with paired data for each new application. Specifically, we first propose a diffusion model enhanced with a novel noise schedule for generative modeling of seismic data, and introduce the non-Markov sampling strategy to achieve fast and quality-controllable unconditional sampling. Building upon this, we further present a posterior sampling method for various noisy inverse problems using the trained unconditional diffusion model. Our method requires only a small number of function evaluations to achieve competitive performance, while enabling flexible posterior sampling that interacts adaptively with different noise levels.Experiments on unconditional generation and posterior sampling across different tasks show that our method not only efficiently models the seismic data distribution and posterior conditioned on observations and tasks but also achieves substantially faster sampling and superior out-of-distribution generalization.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic roughness of rippled beds under active saltation at Earth-to-Mars atmospheric pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As winds blow over sand, grains are mobilized and reorganized into bedforms such as ripples and dunes. In turn, sand transport and bedforms affect the winds themselves. These complex interactions between winds and sediment render modeling of windswept landscapes challenging. A critical parameter in such models is the aerodynamic roughness length, $z_0$, defined as the height above the bed at which wind velocity predicted from the log law drops to zero. In aeolian environments, $z_0$ can variably be controlled by the laminar viscous sublayer, grain roughness, form drag from bedforms, or the saltation layer. Estimates of $z_0$ are used on Mars, notably, to predict wind speeds, sand fluxes, and global circulation patterns; yet, no robust measurements of $z_0$ have been performed over rippled sand on Mars to date. Here, we measure $z_0$ over equilibrated rippled sand beds with active saltation under atmospheric pressures intermediate between those of Earth and Mars. Extrapolated to Mars, our results suggest that $z_0$ over rippled beds and under active saltation may be dominated by form drag across a plausible range of wind velocities, reaching values up to 1 cm -- two orders of magnitude larger than typically assumed for flat beds under similar sediment transport conditions.</description>

      <title>Reactions of abiogenic hydrocarbons in Earth's upper mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of hydrocarbon fuels in Earth's interior has traditionally been considered to have biogenic origins; however, growing evidence suggests that some light hydrocarbons may instead originate abiotically. It is widely expected that the Fisher-Tropsch-type (FTT) process, which typically refers to the conversion of inorganic carbon to organic matter in the geologic convention, may also happen in Earth's interior, but the aqueous conditions and absence of industrial catalysts in deep environments suggest that the FTT process can be very different from that in the chemical industry. Here, we performed extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations (&gt; 2.4 ns) to investigate the FTT synthesis in dry mixture and in aqueous solutions at 10-13 GPa and 1000-1400 K. We found that large hydrocarbon-related species containing C, O, and H are abiotically synthesized via the polymerization of CO without any catalyst. Supercritical water, commonly found in deep Earth, does not prevent organic molecule formation but restricts product size and carbon reduction. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized abiogenic route for hydrocarbon synthesis in mantle geofluids. These carbon-containing fluids could potentially migrate from depth to shallower crustal reservoirs, thereby contributing to the deep carbon cycle, influencing surface carbon budgets, and possibly serving as a new energy source.</description>

      <title>EUNIS Habitat Maps: Enhancing Thematic and Spatial Resolution for Europe through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EUNIS habitat classification is crucial for categorising European habitats, supporting European policy on nature conservation and implementing the Nature Restoration Law. To meet the growing demand for detailed and accurate habitat information, we provide spatial predictions for 260 EUNIS habitat types at hierarchical level 3, together with independent validation and uncertainty analyses.
  Using ensemble machine learning models, together with high-resolution satellite imagery and ecologically meaningful climatic, topographic and edaphic variables, we produced a European habitat map indicating the most probable EUNIS habitat at 100-m resolution across Europe. Additionally, we provide information on prediction uncertainty and the most probable habitats at level 3 within each EUNIS level 1 formation. This product is particularly useful for both conservation and restoration purposes.
  Predictions were cross-validated at European scale using a spatial block cross-validation and evaluated against independent data from France (forests only), the Netherlands and Austria. The habitat maps obtained strong predictive performances on the validation datasets with distinct trade-offs in terms of recall and precision across habitat formations.</description>

      <title>EPBench: A Benchmark for Short-term Earthquake Prediction with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the beginning of this century, the significant advancements in artificial intelligence and neural networks have offered the potential to bring new transformations to short-term earthquake prediction research. However, currently, there is no widely used benchmark for this task. To address this, we have built a new benchmark (EPBench), which is, to our knowledge, the first global regional-scale short-term earthquake prediction benchmark. Our benchmark comprises 924,472 earthquake records and 2959 multimodal earthquake records collected from seismic networks around the world. Each record includes basic information such as time, longitude and latitude, magnitude, while each multimodal record includes waveform and moment tensor information additionally, covering a time span from 1970 to 2021. To evaluate performance of models on this task, we have established a series of data partitions and evaluation methods tailored to the short-term earthquake prediction task. We also provide a variety of tools to assist future researchers in partitioning the data according to their geographical understanding. Our benchmark includes a variety of neural network models widely used for time series forecasting, as well as a statistical-based model currently employed by seismological bureaus in several countries. We hope this benchmark will serve as a guide to attract more researchers to explore new methods for addressing this task, which holds great significance for human existence.

      <title>Deformation Due to Non-planar Fault Movement in Fractional Maxwell Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earthquake-prone regions, the accumulation of geophysical stress during the aseismic period plays a critical role in determining which faults are more likely to be reactivated in future seismic events. In this model, we consider an infinite non-planar fault located in a viscoelastic half-space of a fractional Maxwell medium representing the lithosphere-asthenosphere system comprising three interconnected planar sections. The problem is formulated as a two-dimensional boundary value problem with discontinuities along the fault surface. A numerical solution is obtained using a Laplace transformation, fractional derivative, correspondence principle and Green's function technique. The outcomes are demonstrated graphically using appropriate model parameters. The computational findings highlight the significant influence of fault motion and geometry in shaping the displacement, stress and strain fields in the vicinity of the fault zone. A study has been carried out to investigate how non-planar faults influence displacement and the accumulation of stress and strain. Analysis of these results can provide insights into subsurface deformation and its impact on fault movement, which may contribute to the study of earthquake activity.</description>
