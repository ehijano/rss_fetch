      <title>Nested importance sampling for Bayesian inference: error bounds and the role of dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many Bayesian inference problems involve high dimensional models for which only a subset of the model variables are of actual interest. All other variables are just nuisance parameters that one would ideally like to integrate out analytically. Unfortunately, such integration is often impossible. There are several computational methods that have been proposed over the past 15 years that replace intractable analytical marginalization by numerical integration, typically using different flavours of importance sampling (IS). Such methods include particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$), IS$^2$, nested particle filters, and others. In this paper, we investigate the role of the dimension of the nuisance variables in the error bounds achieved by nested IS methods in Bayesian inference. We prove that, under suitable regularity assumptions on the model, the approximation errors increase at a polynomial (rather than exponential) rate w.r.t. the dimension of the nuisance variables. Our analysis relies on tools from functional analysis and measure theory, and it includes the case of polynomials of degree zero, where the approximation error remains uniformly bounded, even as the dimension of the nuisance variables grows without bound. We also show how the general analysis can be applied to specific classes of models, including linear and Gaussian settings, models with bounded observation functions, and others. These findings improve the current understanding of how the performance of IS techniques scales with dimension in Bayesian inference problems.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Nonparametric Stochastic Block Model for Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random graphs have been widely used in statistics, for example in network analysis and graphical models. In some applications, the data may contain an inherent hierarchical ordering among its vertices, which prevents directed edges between pairs of vertices that do not respect this order. For example, in bibliometrics, older papers cannot cite newer ones. In such situations, the resulting graph forms a Directed Acyclic Graph. In this article, we extend the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to account for the presence of such ordering in the data, ignoring which can lead to biased estimates of the number of blocks. The proposed approach includes in the model likelihood a topological ordering, which is treated as an unknown parameter and endowed with a prior distribution. We describe how to formalise the model and perform posterior inference for a Bayesian nonparametric version of the SBM in which both the hierarchical ordering and the number of latent blocks are learnt from the data. Finally, an illustration with real-world datasets from bibliometrics is presented. Additional supplementary materials are available online.</description>
