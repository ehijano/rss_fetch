      <title>DTN-COMET: A Comprehensive Operational Metrics Evaluation Toolkit for DTN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay- and Disruption-tolerant Networking (DTN) is essential for communication in challenging environments with intermittent connectivity, long delays, and disruptions. Ensuring high performance in these types of networks is crucial because windows for data transmission are sparse and often short. However, research on evaluating DTN implementations is limited. Moreover, existing research relies on manual testing methods that lack reproducibility and scalability. We propose a novel generic framework for reproducible performance evaluation of DTN implementations to address this issue. We validate the framework's accuracy using a physical testbed and compare the uD3TN and ION DTN implementations. This comparison reveals that uD3TN exhibits higher goodput and shorter bundle retention times. On the other hand, ION exhibited superior memory management and fault tolerance, albeit at the cost of sending and receiving performance. Through this comparison, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of developing a generic toolkit for evaluating DTN.</description>

      <title>Attack Mitigation in Gateways of Pervasive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pervasive systems, mobile devices and other sensors access Gateways, which are Servers that communicate with the devices, provide low latency services, connect them with each other, and connect them to the Internet and backbone networks. Gateway Servers are often equipped with Attack Detection (AD) software that analyzes the incoming traffic to protect the system against Cyberattacks, which can overwhelm the Gateway and the system as a whole. This paper describes a traffiic shaping, attack detection and an optimum attack mitigation scheme to protect the Gateway and the system as a whole from Cyberattacks. The approach is described and evaluated in an experimental testbed. The key parameter of the optimum mitigation technique is chosen based on an analytical model whose predictions are validated through detailed experiments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Attack Mitigation for IoV Flood Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gateway Servers for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) must meet stringent Security and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, including cyberattack protection, low delays and minimal packet loss, to offer secure real-time data exchange for human and vehicle safety and efficient road traffic management. Therefore, it is vital to protect these systems from cyberattacks with adequate Attack Detection (AD) and Mitigation mechanisms. Such attacks often include packet Floods that impair the QoS of the networks and Gateways and even impede the Gateways capability to carry out AD. Thus, this paper first evaluates these effects using system measurements during Flood attacks. It then demonstrates how a Smart Quasi-Deterministic Policy Forwarder (SQF) at the entrance of the Gateway can regulate the incoming traffic to ensure that the Gateway supports the AD to operate promptly during an attack. Since Flood attacks create substantial packet backlogs, we propose a novel Adaptive Attack Mitigation (AAM) system that is activated after an attack is detected to dynamically sample the incoming packet stream, determine whether the attack is continuing, and also drop batches of packets at the input to reduce the effects of the attack. The AAM is designed to minimize a cost function that includes the sampling overhead and the cost of lost benign packets. We show experimentally that the Optimum AAM approach is effective in mitigating attacks and present theoretical and experimental results that validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Online Slice Admission Control and Resource Allocation for 5G and Beyond Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtualization in 5G and beyond networks allows the creation of virtual networks, or network slices, tailored to meet the requirements of various applications. However, this flexibility introduces several challenges for infrastructure providers (InPs) in slice admission control (AC) and resource allocation. To maximize revenue, InPs must decide in real-time whether to admit new slice requests (SRs) given slices' revenues, limited infrastructure resources, unknown relationship between resource allocation and Quality of Service (QoS), and the unpredictability of future SRs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel data-driven framework for 5G slice admission control that offers a guaranteed upper bound on the competitive ratio, i.e., the ratio between the revenue obtained by an oracle solution and that of the online solution. The proposed framework leverages a pricing function to dynamically estimate resources' pseudo-prices that reflect resource scarcity. Such prices are further coupled with a resource allocation algorithm, which leverages a machine-learned slice model and employs a primal-dual algorithm to determine the minimum-cost resource allocation. The resource cost is then compared with the offered revenue to admit or reject a SR. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we train the data-driven slice model using real traces collected from our 5G testbed. Our results show that our novel approach achieves up to 42% improvement in the empirical competitive ratio, i.e., ratio between the optimal and the online solution, compared to other benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Ruling the Unruly: Designing Effective, Low-Noise Network Intrusion Detection Rules for Security Operations Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Security Operations Centers (SOCs) today still heavily rely on signature-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) such as Suricata. The specificity of intrusion detection rules and the coverage provided by rulesets are common concerns within the professional community surrounding SOCs, which impact the effectiveness of automated alert post-processing approaches. We postulate a better understanding of factors influencing the quality of rules can help address current SOC issues. In this paper, we characterize the rules in use at a collaborating commercial (managed) SOC serving customers in sectors including education and IT management. During this process, we discover six relevant design principles, which we consolidate through interviews with experienced rule designers at the SOC.We then validate our design principles by quantitatively assessing their effect on rule specificity. We find that several of these design considerations significantly impact unnecessary workload caused by rules. For instance, rules that leverage proxies for detection, and rules that do not employ alert throttling or do not distinguish (un)successful malicious actions, cause significantly more workload for SOC analysts. Moreover, rules that match a generalized characteristic to detect malicious behavior, which is believed to increase coverage, also significantly increase workload, suggesting a tradeoff must be struck between rule specificity and coverage. We show that these design principles can be applied successfully at a SOC to reduce workload whilst maintaining coverage despite the prevalence of violations of the principles.</description>

      <title>pFedWN: A Personalized Federated Learning Framework for D2D Wireless Networks with Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) approaches often struggle with data heterogeneity across clients, leading to suboptimal model performance for individual clients. To address this issue, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) emerges as a solution to the challenges posed by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and unbalanced data across clients. Furthermore, in most existing decentralized machine learning works, a perfect communication channel is considered for model parameter transmission between clients and servers. However, decentralized PFL over wireless links introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and interference management. To overcome these challenges, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates the underlying device-to-device (D2D) wireless channel conditions into a server-free PFL approach. The proposed method, dubbed pFedWN, optimizes the learning performance for each client while accounting for the variability in D2D wireless channels. To tackle the formulated problem, we divide it into two sub-problems: PFL neighbor selection and PFL weight assignment. The PFL neighbor selection is addressed through channel-aware neighbor selection within unlicensed spectrum bands such as ISM bands. Next, to assign PFL weights, we utilize the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method to evaluate the similarity between clients' data and obtain optimal weight distribution among the chosen PFL neighbors. Empirical results show that pFedWN provides efficient and personalized learning performance with non-IID and unbalanced datasets. Furthermore, it outperforms the existing FL and PFL methods in terms of learning efficacy and robustness, particularly under dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Ultra-Reliable Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of 5G and 6G networks, the demands extend beyond high data rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive coverage, increasingly emphasizing the need for reliability. This paper proposes an ultra-reliable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme utilizing quasi-orthogonal space-time block coding (QOSTBC) combined with singular value decomposition (SVD) for channel state information (CSI) correction, significantly improving performance over QOSTBC and traditional orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) when analyzing spectral efficiency. Although QOSTBC enhances spectral efficiency, it also increases computational complexity at the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. To address this, a neural network-based decoding scheme using phase-transmittance radial basis function (PT-RBF) architecture is also introduced to manage QOSTBC's complexity. Simulation results demonstrate improved system robustness and performance, making this approach a potential candidate for ultra-reliable communication in next-generation networks.</description>

Abstract: This work tackles the problem of reducing the power consumption of the OLSR routing protocol in vehicular networks. Nowadays, energy-aware and green communication protocols are important research topics, specially when deploying wireless mobile networks. This article introduces a fast automatic methodology to search for energy-efficient OLSR configurations by using a parallel evolutionary algorithm. The experimental analysis demonstrates that significant improvements over the standard configuration can be attained in terms of power consumption, with no noteworthy loss in the QoS.</description>

      <title>A swarm algorithm for collaborative traffic in vehicular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicles to exchange warning messages with each other. These specific kinds of networks help reduce hazardous traffic situations and improve safety, which are two of the main objectives in developing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For this, the performance of VANETs should guarantee the delivery of messages in a required time. An obstacle to this is that the data traffic generated may cause network congestion. Data congestion control is used to enhance network capabilities, increasing the reliability of the VANET by decreasing packet losses and communication delays. In this study, we propose a swarm intelligence based distributed congestion control strategy to maintain the channel usage level under the threshold of network malfunction, while keeping the quality-of-service of the VANET high. An exhaustive experimentation shows that the proposed strategy improves the throughput of the network, the channel usage, and the stability of the communications in comparison with other competing congestion control strategies.</description>

Abstract: This article describes the application of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for locating roadside infrastructure for vehicular communication networks over realistic urban areas. A multiobjective formulation of the problem is introduced, considering quality-of-service and cost objectives. The experimental analysis is performed over a real map of M\'alaga, using real traffic information and antennas, and scenarios that model different combinations of traffic patterns and applications (text/audio/video) in the communications. The proposed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm computes accurate trade-off solutions, significantly improving over state-of-the-art algorithms previously applied to the problem.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Aware RIoT System: Analysis, Modeling and Prediction in the SUPERIOT Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption characteristics of a Silicon (Si)-based Reconfigurable IoT (RIoT) node developed in the initial phase of the SUPERIOT project, focusing on key operating states, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, Narrow-Band Visible Light Communication (NBVLC), sensing, and E-ink display. Extensive measurements were conducted to establish a detailed energy profile, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of subsequent optimizations and future node iterations. To minimize the energy consumption, multiple optimizations were implemented at both the software and hardware levels, achieving a reduction of over 60% in total energy usage through software modifications alone. Further improvements were realized by optimizing the E-ink display driving waveform and implementing a very low-power mode for non-communication activities. Based on the measured data, three measurement-based energy consumption models were developed to characterize the energy behavior of the node under: (i) normal, unoptimized operation, (ii) low-power, software-optimized operation, and (iii) very low-power, hardware-optimized operation. These models, validated with new measurement data, achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, confirming their reliability for predicting energy consumption in diverse configurations.</description>

      <title>The NIC should be part of the OS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a modern cloud server which occupies a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to the efficient operation of the machine, but unlike application-oriented compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency. Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path. However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernel-bypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Virtual Network Embedding with uniform demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNE), which is the combinatorial core of several telecommunication problems related to the implementation of virtualization technologies, such as Network Slicing. VNE is to find an optimal assignment of virtual demands to physical resources, encompassing simultaneous placement and routing decisions. The problem is known to be strongly NP-hard, even when the virtual network is a uniform path, but is polynomial in some practical cases. This article aims to draw a cohesive frontier between easy and hard instances for VNE. For this purpose, we consider uniform demands to focus on structural aspects, rather than packing ones. To this end, specific topologies are studied for both virtual and physical networks that arise in practice, such as trees, cycles, wheels and cliques. Some polynomial greedy or dynamic programming algorithms are proposed, when the physical network is a tree or a cycle, whereas other close cases are shown NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Analytical Performance Estimations for Quantum Repeater Network Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum repeater chains will form the backbone of future quantum networks that distribute entanglement between network nodes. Therefore, it is important to understand the entanglement distribution performance of quantum repeater chains, especially their throughput and latency. By using Markov chains to model the stochastic dynamics in quantum repeater chains, we offer analytical estimations for long-run throughput and on-demand latency of continuous entanglement distribution. We first study single-link entanglement generation using general multiheralded protocols. We then model entanglement distribution with entanglement swapping over two links, using either a single- or a double-heralded entanglement generation protocol. We also demonstrate how the two-link results offer insights into the performance of general $2^k$-link nested repeater chains. Our results enrich the quantitative understanding of quantum repeater network performance, especially the dependence on system parameters. The analytical formulae themselves are valuable reference resources for the quantum networking community. They can serve as benchmarks for quantum network simulation validation or as examples of quantum network dynamics modeling using the Markov chain formalism.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we have experimentally modelled the movement of a bee colony in a hive during the winter season and developed a monitoring system that allows tracking the movement of the bee colony and honey consumption. The monitoring system consists of four load cells connected to the RP2040 controller based on the Raspberry Pi Pico board, from which data is transmitted via the MQTT protocol to the Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer via a Wi-Fi network. The processed data from the Raspberry Pi 5 is recorded in a MySQL database. The algorithm for finding the location of the bee colony in the hive works correctly, the trajectory of movement based on the data from the sensors repeats the physical movement in the experiment, which is an imitation of the movement of the bee colony in real conditions. The proposed monitoring system provides continuous observation of the bee colony without adversely affecting its natural activities and can be integrated with various wireless data networks. This is a promising tool for improving the efficiency of beekeeping and maintaining the health of bee colonies.</description>
