      <title>Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of novel mechanisms for superconductivity is a longstanding goal in theoretical physics. In this work, we argue that the combination of repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing, phase coherence and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial Mott insulator. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs above the half-filled ground states not just near the putative critical point but over a remarkably broad range of coupling strengths on both sides of criticality. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the storied mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermal transport in ultraclean single crystals of Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has emerged as a promising candidate for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Previous studies have reported oscillation-like anomalies in the longitudinal thermal conductivity and half-integer quantized thermal Hall conductivity above the antiferromagnetic critical field $H_c$, generating significant interest. However, the origins of these phenomena remain contentious due to strong sample dependence. Here we re-examine the magnetothermal transport properties using recently available ultra-pure $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ single crystals to further elucidate potential signatures of the spin liquid state. Our findings reveal that while anomalies in thermal conductivity above $H_c$ persist even in ultraclean crystals, their magnitude is significantly attenuated, contrary to the quantum oscillations hypothesis. This suggests that the anomalies are likely attributable to localized stacking faults inadvertently introduced during magnetothermal transport measurements. The thermal Hall conductivity exhibits a half-quantized plateau, albeit with a narrower width than previously reported. This observation aligns with theoretical predictions emphasizing the importance of interactions between chiral edge currents and phonons. These results indicate that structural imperfections exert a substantial influence on both the oscillation-like anomalies and quantization effects observed in magnetothermal transport measurements of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shot noise in a bad metal beta-tantalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic shot noise produced by nanowires of beta-Ta, an archetypal ``bad" metal with resistivity near the Ioffe-Regel localization limit. The Fano factor characterizing the shot noise exhibits a strong dependence on temperature and is suppressed compared to the expectations for quasiparticle diffusion, but hopping transport is ruled out by the analysis of scaling with the nanowire length. These anomalous behaviors closely resemble those of strange metal nanowires, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated electron liquid. This material provides an accessible platform for exploring exotic electronic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$: Evidence against Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev quantum spin liquids (KSLs) in layered honeycomb magnets are known to host Majorana quasiparticles, whose excitations depend strongly on the direction of the applied magnetic field. In the high-field phase of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, specific heat measurements have revealed characteristic field-angle dependence of low-energy excitations consistent with the Kitaev model, providing bulk evidence for the KSL state. Here we present low-temperature measurements of specific heat $C(T)$ for another KSL candidate $\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{Co}_2\textrm{Te}\textrm{O}_6$ (NCTO) under field rotation within the honeycomb plane. Above the critical field of antiferromagnetic order, the field-angle dependence of $C/T$ exhibits minima along the bond directions, contrasting with the maxima observed in the KSL state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Our analysis indicates nodeless, fully-gapped excitations, which are inconsistent with the angle-dependent Majorana excitations with gapless nodes predicted by the Kitaev model. These findings suggest that low-energy excitations in NCTO are governed by gapped magnon excitations rather than Majorana quasiparticles, providing thermodynamic evidence against a KSL state.</description>

      <title>Density of states of the Hubbard model supplemented with the quantizing magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the strong coupling diagram technique, we calculate the zero-temperature density of states $\rho$ of electrons on a square lattice immersed in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field. The electrons are described by Hubbard Hamiltonian. For moderate doping, Landau subbands are observed for small Hubbard repulsions $U$ only. For larger $U$, the subbands are blurred. Instead, small peaks varying with the field induction $B$ arise by opening the Mott gap in its vicinity. The related variation of $\rho$ with $1/B$ may be connected with the low-frequency quantum oscillations in lightly doped cuprates. For all considered repulsions, $\rho$ has gaps near transfer frequencies of the Hubbard atom, $-\mu$ and $U-\mu$, with $\mu$ the chemical potential. In the heavily underdoped case $\mu&lt;0$, Landau subbands are grouped into the lower and upper Hubbard subbands for moderate and large repulsions. The intensity of the upper Hubbard subband decreases with approaching the Fermi level to the lower edge of the spectrum and finally vanishes.</description>

      <title>Crystalline electric field excitations and their nonlinear splitting under magnetic fields in YbOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently reported van der Waals layered honeycomb rare-earth chalcohalides REChX (RE = rare earth, Ch = chalcogen, and X = halogen) are considered to be promising Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) candidates. The high-quality single crystals of YbOCl, a representative member of the family with an effective spin of 1/2, are available now. The crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations in a rare-earth spin system are fundamentally important for understanding both finite-temperature and ground-state magnetism, but remain unexplored in YbOCl so far. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive Raman scattering study to unambiguously identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl and determine the CEF parameters and wave functions. Our Raman experiments further reveal the anomalous nonlinear CEF splitting under magnetic fields. We have grown single crystals of YbOCl, the nonmagnetic LuOCl, and the diluted magnetic Lu_{0.86}Yb_{0.14}OCl to make a completely comparative investigation. Polarized Raman spectra on the samples at 1.8 K allow us to clearly assign all the Raman-active phonon modes and explicitly identify the CEF excitations in YbOCl. The CEF excitations are further examined using temperature-dependent Raman measurements and careful symmetry analysis based on Raman tensors related to CEF excitations. By applying the CEF Hamiltonian to the experimentally determined CEF excitations, we extract the CEF parameters and eventually determine the CEF wave functions. The study experimentally pins down the CEF excitations in the Kitaev compound YbOCl and sets a foundation for understanding its finite-temperature magnetism and exploring the possible nontrivial spin ground state.</description>

      <title>The electronic structure of EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ in the vicinity of the critical endpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals significant alterations in the valence band states of EuPd$_2$Si$_2$ at a temperature $T_V$, where the Eu ions undergo a temperature-induced valence crossover from a magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ state to a low-temperature valence-fluctuating state. The introduction of small amounts of Au on Pd lattice sites and Ge on Si sites, respectively, results in a decrease in $T_V$ and the emergence of an antiferromagnetic state at low temperatures without valence fluctuations. It has been proposed that the boundary between AFM order and valence crossover represents a first-order phase transition associated with a specific type of second-order critical end point. In this scenario, strong coupling effects between fluctuating charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom are to be expected. In the case of EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ with x=0.13, which is situated close to the critical end point, a splitting of conduction band states and the emergence of flat bands with one-dimensional character have been observed. A comparison with ab initio theory demonstrates a high degree of correlation with experimental findings, particularly in regard to the bands situated in proximity to the critical end point.</description>

      <title>Observation of Complete Orbital Two-channel Kondo Effect in van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital two-channel Kondo (2CK) effect is one of the crucial systems with non- Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors. But the full three-regime transport evidence has never been observed in one sample. Here, all three-resistive regimes for the orbital 2CK effect induced by two-level systems (TLSs) have been observed in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The electron behavior undergoes a continuous transition from electron scattering to the NFL behavior, and subsequently to Fermi liquid behavior. The magnetic field does not affect any regimes, indicating the non-magnetic origin of the TLSs in Fe3GaTe2. In addition, the slope of linear negative magnetoresistance, rather than the topological Hall effect, has been found to be related to spin-magnon scattering and can be used to infer the emergence of spin textures. Our findings indicate Fe3GaTe2 may be an ideal platform to study electron-correlation and topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic evidence for polaron stabilization inside the antiferromagnetic order of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials exhibiting electronic inhomogeneities at the nanometer scale have enormous potential for applications. Magnetic polarons are one such type of inhomogeneity which link the electronic, magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in correlated matter and often give rise to colossal magnetoresistance. Here, we investigate single crystals of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ by thermal expansion and magnetostriction along different crystallographic directions. These data provide compelling evidence for the formation of magnetic polarons in Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ well above the magnetic ordering temperature. More specifically, our results are consistent with anisotropic polarons with varying extent along the different crystallographic directions and successfully explain the strongly temperature- and magnetic field-dependent resistivities in Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, the dilatometry measurements are highly sensitive to the material's magnetic structure and reveal a crossover not observed in magnetic and transport properties. This crossover can be associated with a surprising stabilization of ferromagnetic polarons within the global antiferromagnetic order upon decreasing temperature. These findings make Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ a rare example of such coexisting and competing magnetic orders and, importantly, sheds new light on colossal magnetoresistive behavior beyond manganites.</description>

      <title>Monopole excitations in the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid might realize an exotic phase of matter whose low-energy properties are described by quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions, where gapless modes exists but spinons and gauge fields are strongly coupled. Its existence has been proposed in frustrated Heisenberg models in presence of frustrating super-exchange interactions, by the (Abrikosov) fermionic representation of the spin operators [X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. B 65, 165113 (2002)}], supplemented by the Gutzwiller projection. Here, we construct charge-$Q$ monopole excitations in the Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with nearest- ($J_1$) and next-neighbor ($J_2$) couplings. In the highly frustrated regime, singlet and triplet monopoles with $Q=1$ become gapless in the thermodynamic limit; in addition, the energies for generic $Q$ agree with field-theoretical predictions, obtained for a large number of gapless fermion modes. Finally, we consider localized gauge excitations, in which magnetic $\pi$-fluxes are concentrated in the triangular plaquettes (in analogy with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ visons), showing that these kind of states do not play a relevant role at low-energies. All our findings lend support to a stable $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid in the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Preempting Fermion Sign Problem: Unveiling Quantum Criticality through Nonequilibrium Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notorious fermion sign problem, arising from fermion statistics, constitutes one of the main obstacles of deciphering quantum many-body systems by numerical approach. The progress in overcoming sign problem will definitely lead to a great leap in various areas of modern physics. Here, by deviating from the conventional cognition that nonequilibrium studies should be more complicated than equilibrium cases, we propose an innovative framework based on nonequilibrium critical dynamics to preempt sign problem and investigate quantum critical point in fermionic model through numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation. By virtue of universal scaling theory of imaginary-time relaxation dynamics, we demonstrate that accurate critical point and critical exponents can be obtained in the short-time stage, in which the sign problem is not severe such that the QMC is accessible. After confirming the effectiveness of the method in two typical interacting fermionic models featuring Dirac quantum critical point (QCP), we for the first time reveal the quantum phase diagram in the Hubbard model hosting $\rm SU(3)$-symmetric Dirac fermions, and find that the QCP between Dirac semi-metal and a $\lambda_8$-antiferromagnetic phase belongs to a new universality class different from the previously known Gross-Neveu transitions.</description>

      <title>Directionally asymmetric nonlinear optics in planar chiral MnTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar chiral structures possess a two dimensional handedness that is associated with broken mirror symmetry. Such motifs span vast length scales; examples include certain pinwheel molecules, nautilus shells, cyclone wind patterns and spiral galaxies. Although pervasive in nature, it has only recently been found that condensed matter systems can exhibit a form of planar chirality through toroidal arrangements of electric dipoles, known as ferro-rotational (FR) order. A key characteristic of such order is that enantiomorph conversion occurs when the solid is flipped by 180 degrees about an in-plane axis. Consequently, ferro-rotationally ordered materials may exhibit directionally asymmetric response functions, even while preserving inversion and time-reversal symmetry. Such an effect, however, has yet to be observed. Using second harmonic interferometry, we show here that when circularly polarized light is incident on MnTiO$_3$, the generated nonlinear signal exhibits directional asymmetry. Depending on whether the incident light is parallel or anti-parallel to the FR axis, we observe a different conversion efficiency of two right (left) circularly polarized photons into a frequency-doubled left (right) circularly polarized photon. Our work uncovers a fundamentally new optical effect in ordered solids and opens up the possibility for developing novel nonlinear and directionally asymmetric optical devices.</description>

      <title>Flat Electron Bands with Bad Valley Quantum Numbers in Twisted Bi-Layer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the energy spectrum of a nearest-neighbor electron hopping model for bi-layer graphene at commensurate twist angles. Specifically, we focus on the simplest bi-layer lattices, with moire patterns that have no subcells. The electron hopping hamiltonian is analyzed in momentum space, both by degenerate perturbation theory and by exact numerical calculation. We find that the degeneracy in energy along the edge of the moire Brillouin zone due to the two valley quantum numbers is noticeably broken in the flat central bands at the magic twist angle. A mechanism for the appearance of flat central bands themselves at the magic twist angle is also revealed. It is due to maximal level repulsion. The mechanism relies on the assumption that the phase factor for the AA hamiltonian matrix element for inter-graphene-sheet hopping at the middle of the edge of the moire Brillouin zone has a phase equal to half the twist angle. This assumption is confirmed in the case of uniform AA hopping in between the two sheets of graphene, in the limit of large moire unit cells.</description>

Abstract: Superconductors are often discussed in the mean-field approximation that breaks $U(1)$ symmetry. Since the $U(1)$ symmetry underlies the charge conservation, naive application of response theory sometimes gives results that are not gauge-invariant. We study the effect of vertex corrections on the electromagnetic responses of superconductors by employing the gauge-invariant formulation, called consistent fluctuations of order parameters, that manifestly satisfy the Ward identity. For inversion broken two-band superconductors, we find that the linear and second-order optical responses are significantly affected by vertex corrections and the conductivities near the gap energy almost completely disappear. We also investigate the linear optical responses in $d$-wave superconductors and obtained qualitatively different results compared to the result using the solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The full photon vertex used in our study, manifestly satisfies the Ward identity. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of vertex corrections in exploring optical responses in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Holographic Weyl semimetals with dislocations</title>

Abstract: Weyl semimetals (WSMs) represent three-dimensional gapless topological states of matter characterized by the monopole-antimonopole pairs of the Abelian Berry curvature at the band-touching points in the momentum space. As a consequence, they display chiral anomalies that can be realized through a crystalline dislocation defect associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. Using the last two features of WSMs as our guiding principles, we construct a holographic WSM with dislocations by utilizing the ($4+1$)-dimensional Chern-Simons gravitational theory in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This theory encodes the chiral anomaly and incorporates torsion, thereby holographically capturing lattice dislocation defects. By explicitly solving the equations of motion employing the asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that such a theory at the ($3+1$)-dimensional spacetime boundary possesses axially-symmetric solutions that can be interpreted as holographic WSMs with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded through a black hole in the bulk gravity. Such solutions, at the same time, feature the chiral anomaly proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results should therefore motivate future studies of the holographic topological phases by employing bulk gravitational Chern-Simons theories and establishing torsion as a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</description>

      <title>High-throughput search for topological magnon materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnons give rise to possibilities for engineering novel spintronics devices with critical applications in quantum information and computation, due to its symmetry-protected robustness and low dissipation. However, to make reliable and systematic predictions about material realization of topological magnons has been a major challenge, due to the lack of neutron scattering data for most materials. In this work, we significantly advance the symmetry-based approach for identifying topological magnons through developing a fully automated algorithm, utilizing the theory of symmetry indicators, that enables a highly efficient and large-scale search for candidate materials hosting field-induced topological magnons. This progress not only streamlines the discovery process but also expands the scope of materials exploration beyond previous manual or traditional methods, offering a powerful tool for uncovering novel topological phases in magnetic systems. Performing a large-scale search over all 1649 magnetic materials in Bilbao Crystallographic Server with a commensurate magnetic order, we discover 387 candidate materials for topological magnons, significantly expanding the pool of topological magnon materials. We further discuss examples and experimental accessibility of the candidate materials, shedding light on future experimental realizations of topological magnons in magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars beyond the PXP model in Rydberg simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of topological magnon edge states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnon Chern insulators (MCIs) exhibit unique topological magnon band structures featuring chiral edge states. Direct observations of the topologically protected magnon edge states have long been pursued. Here, we report the spatially resolved detection of magnon edge states in a two-dimensional ferromagnet with honeycomb lattice (single-layer chromium triiodide). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed magnon-assisted inelastic tunneling conductance and revealed the gapped magnon spectra with enhanced signals at the van Hove singularities. Extra tunneling conductance contributed from the magnon edge states was detected at three different edge configurations. Our work provided direct evidence proving the existence of MCI states down to the single-layer limit, initiating spatially-resolved explorations on exotic properties arising from topological edge states of MCIs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum as a diagnostic of chirality of Topological Spin Liquids: Analysis of an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ PEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the key question of representation of chiral topological quantum states in (2+1) dimensions (i.e., with non-zero chiral central charge) by Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). A noted result (due to Wahl, Tu, Schuch, and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 236805 (2013)], and Dubail and Read [Phys. Rev. B 92, 205307 (2015)]) says that this is possible for non-interacting fermions, but the answer is as yet unknown for interacting systems. Characteristic counting of degeneracies of low-lying states in the entanglement spectrum (ES) at fixed transverse momentum of bipartitioned long cylinders ("Li-Haldane counting") provides often-used supporting evidence for chirality. However, non-chiral PEPS (with zero chiral central charge), yet with strong breaking of time-reversal and reflection symmetries, with invariance under the product of these two operations (i.e., "apparently" chiral states), are known whose low-lying ES exhibits the same Li-Haldane counting as a chiral state in certain topological sectors [Kure\v{c}i\'c, Vanderstraeten, and Schuch, Phys. Rev. B 99, 045116 (2019); Arildsen, Schuch, and Ludwig, Phys. Rev. B 108, 245150 (2023)]. In the present work, we identify a distinct indicator and hallmark of chirality in the ES of PEPS with global $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry: the splittings of conjugate irreps. We prove that in the ES of the chiral states conjugate irreps are exactly degenerate, because the operators that would split them [related to the cubic Casimir invariant of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$] are forbidden. By contrast, in the ES of non-chiral states, conjugate splittings are demonstrably non-vanishing. Such a diagnostic provides an unambiguous and powerful tool to distinguish chiral and non-chiral topological states in (2+1) dimensions via their entanglement spectra.</description>

Abstract: Mesonic bound states of domain walls can be stabilized in quasi one-dimensional magnetic compounds. Here, we theoretically study the Raman light scattering response of a twisted Kitaev chain with tilted magnetic fields as a minimal model for confinement in $\mathrm{CoNb}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$. By both numerical matrix product states and few-domain wall variational states, we show that confinement-induced bound states directly manifest themselves as sharp peaks in the Raman response. Remarkably, by tuning the polarization of the incident light field, we demonstrate that the Raman response offers new insights into the intrinsic symmetry of the bound state wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Optical and acoustic plasmons in the layered material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use momentum-dependent electron energy-loss spectroscopy in transmission to study collective charge excitations in the layer metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. This metal has a transition from a perfect Fermi liquid below $T\approx30\,$K into a "strange" metal phase above $T\approx800\,$K. We cover a complete range between in-phase and out-of-phase oscillations. Outside the classical range of electron-hole excitations, leading to a Landau damping, we observe well-defined plasmons. The optical (acoustic) plasmon due to an in-phase (out-of-phase) charge oscillation of neighbouring layers exhibits a quadratic (linear) positive dispersion. Using a model for the Coulomb interaction of the charges in a layered system, it is possible to describe the range of optical plasmon excitations at high energies in a mean-field random phase approximation without taking correlation effects into account. In contrast, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering data show at low energies an enhancement of the acoustic plasmon velocity due to correlation effects. This difference can be explained by an energy dependent effective mass which changes from $\approx$ 3.5 at low energy to 1 at high energy near the optical plasmon energy. There are no signs of over-damped plasmons predicted by holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Weyl-Kondo semimetals induced by quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl-Kondo semimetals are strongly correlated topological semimetals that develop through the cooperation of the Kondo effect with space group symmetries. The Kondo effect, capturing quantum fluctuations associated with strong correlations, is usually suppressed by magnetic order. Here we develop the theory of magnetic Weyl-Kondo semimetal. The key of the proposed mechanism is that the magnetic order comes from conduction $d$ electrons, such that the local $f$ moments can still fluctuate. We illustrate the extreme case where the magnetic space group symmetries prevent any spontaneous magnetization on the sites with the $f$-orbitals. In this case, topological degeneracies, including hourglass Weyl-Kondo nodal lines, appear when the magnetic space group symmetry constrains the Kondo-driven low-energy excitations; they lead to a third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall response. Based on the proposed mechanism, we explore the interplay between strong correlations and symmetries with database search leading to several candidate materials. The most prominent candidates are antiferromagnetic $\rm UNiGa$ and $\rm UNiAl$, with a third-order anomalous Hall response, as well as ferromagnetic $\rm USbTe$ and $\rm CeCoPO$, with a first-order one. Our findings pave the way for future experimental and theoretical investigations that promise to further advance the overarching theme of strongly correlated topology.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews recent experimental and theoretical developments of the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect-driven phenomena in heavy transition metal-based spin-orbit Mott insulators. In cubic $4d/5d$ transition metal compounds, the spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom can form quantum entanglement on metal sites and induce unconventional quantum phenomena. Fingerprints of orbital-lattice entanglement called the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect appear in spectroscopic data such as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. In cubic $5d^1$ compounds with the fcc structure, the dynamic Jahn-Teller states on metal sites behave cooperatively and exhibit rich ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Exotic Superfluid with Emergent flux in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03875v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a novel chiral superfluid (CSF) phase in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi Hubbard model with significant mass and density imbalance between the two species. In the CSF phase, bosons condensate at non-zero momentum $\pm 2\pi /L$ with chain length $L$. To capture the essential physics of this new phenomenon, we study an alternative simplified model that only features competition between single-fermion hopping and hopping of composite particles composed of a fermion and a boson. This model captures the low energy physics of the Hubbard model and hosts a robust CSF phase. Our unbiased numerical studies show that in the CSF phase, the local superfluid order parameter continuously rotates along the chain, indicating that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken. This symmetry breaking generates an emergent flux in the background, effectively optimizing the system's ground-state energy. We provide a physical understanding at the mean-field level. Furthermore, we have explored the potential realization of this phase in cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two monochromatic light sources at a quantized rate. The pristine nature and gate tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family, we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative losses using commensurate frequencies, thus opening a potential pathway for net amplification.</description>

Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>
