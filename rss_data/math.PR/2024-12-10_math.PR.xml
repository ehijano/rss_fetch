      <title>Near-critical and finite-size scaling for high-dimensional lattice trees and animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spread-out models of lattice trees and lattice animals on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d$ above the upper critical dimension $d_{\mathrm c}=8$. We define a correlation length and prove that it diverges as $(p_c-p)^{-1/4}$ at the critical point $p_c$. Using this, we prove that the near-critical two-point function is bounded above by $C|x|^{-(d-2)}\exp[-c(p_c-p)^{1/4}|x|]$. We apply the near-critical bound to study lattice trees and lattice animals on a discrete $d$-dimensional torus (with $d &gt; d_{\mathrm c}$) of volume $V$. For $p_c-p$ of order $V^{-1/2}$, we prove that the torus susceptibility is of order $V^{1/4}$, and that the torus two-point function behaves as $|x|^{-(d-2)} + V^{-3/4}$ and thus has a plateau of size $V^{-3/4}$. The proofs require significant extensions of previous results obtained using the lace expansion.</description>

      <title>Critical scaling profile for trees and connected subgraphs on the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse generating functions for trees and for connected subgraphs on the complete graph, and identify a single scaling profile which applies for both generating functions in a critical window. Our motivation comes from the analysis of the finite-size scaling of lattice trees and lattice animals on a high-dimensional discrete torus, for which we conjecture that the identical profile applies in dimensions $d \ge 8$.</description>

      <title>Random attractors for the stochastic Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes system with multiplicative white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the 2D periodic stochastic Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes equations with body forces perturbed by multiplicative white noise. We first transform the stochastic Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes system into the deterministic system and address the problem of global well-posedness of the solution. Then, we generate a corresponding random dynamical system and dedicate to proving the existence of a compact random attractor for such random dynamical system. Furthermore, upper semicontinuity of the random attractor is established when the noise intensity approaches to zero.</description>

      <title>Controlled rough SDEs, pathwise stochastic control and dynamic programming principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic optimal control of rough stochastic differential equations (RSDEs). This is in the spirit of the pathwise control problem (Lions--Souganidis 1998, Buckdahn--Ma 2007; also Davis--Burstein 1992), with renewed interest and recent works drawing motivation from filtering, SPDEs, and reinforcement learning. Results include regularity of rough value functions, validity of a rough dynamic programming principles and new rough stability results for HJB equations, removing excessive regularity demands previously imposed by flow transformation methods. Measurable selection is used to relate RSDEs to "doubly stochastic" SDEs under conditioning. In contrast to previous works, Brownian statistics for the to-be-conditioned-on noise are not required, aligned with the "pathwise" intuition that these should not matter upon conditioning. Depending on the chosen class of admissible controls, the involved processes may also be anticipating. The resulting stochastic value functions coincide in great generality for different classes of controls. RSDE theory offers a powerful and unified perspective on this problem class.</description>

      <title>Quasi-multiplicativity and regularity for critical metric graph Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove quasi-multiplicativity for critical level-sets of Gaussian free fields (GFF) on the metric graphs $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}^d$ ($d\ge 3$). Specifically, we study the probability of connecting two general sets located on opposite sides of an annulus with inner and outer radii both of order $N$, where we impose additional constraints on the distance between each set to the annulus. We show that for all $d \ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d=6$, this probability is of the same order as $N^{(6-d)\land 0}$ (serving as a correction factor) times the product of the two probabilities of connecting each set to the closer boundary of this annulus. The analogue for $d=6$ is also derived, although the upper and lower bounds differ by a divergent factor of $N^{o(1)}$. Notably, it was conjectured by Basu and Sapozhnikov (2017) that quasi-multiplicativity without correction factor holds for Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ when $3\le d&lt;6$ and fails when $d&gt;6$. In high dimensions (i.e., $d&gt;6$), taking into account the similarity between the metric graph GFF and Bernoulli percolation (which was proposed by Werner (2016) and later partly confirmed by the authors (2024)), our result provides support to the conjecture that Bernoulli percolation exhibits quasi-multiplicativity with correction factor $N^{6-d}$.
  During our proof of quasi-multiplicativity, numerous regularity properties, which are interesting on their own right, were also established.
  A crucial application of quasi-multiplicativity is proving the existence of the incipient infinite cluster (IIC), which has been completed by Basu and Sapozhnikov (2017) for Bernoulli percolation for $3\le d&lt;6$. Inspired by their work, in a companion paper, we also utilize quasi-multiplicativity to establish the IIC for metric graph GFFs, for all $d\ge 3$ except for the critical dimension $6$.</description>

      <title>Incipient infinite clusters and self-similarity for metric graph Gaussian free fields and loop soups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence and equivalence of four types of incipient infinite clusters (IICs) for the critical Gaussian free field (GFF) level-set and the critical loop soup on the metric graph $\widetilde{\mathbb{Z}}^d$ for all $d\ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d=6$. These IICs are defined as four limiting conditional probabilities, involving different conditionings and various ways of taking limits:
  (1) conditioned on $\{0 \leftrightarrow{} \partial B(N)\}$ at criticality (where $\partial B(N)$ is the boundary of the box $B(N)$ centered at the origin $0$ with side length $2N$), and letting $N\to \infty$;
  (2) conditioned on $\{0\leftrightarrow{} \infty\}$ at super-criticality, and letting the parameter tend to the critical threshold;
  (3) conditioned on $\{0 \leftrightarrow{} x\}$ at criticality (where $x\in \mathbb{Z}^d$ is a lattice point), and letting $x\to \infty$;
  (4) conditioned on the event that the capacity of the critical cluster containing $0$ exceeds $T$, and letting $T\to \infty$.
  Our proof employs a robust framework of Basu and Sapozhinikov (2017) for constructing IICs as in (1) and (2) for Bernoulli percolation in low dimensions (i.e., $3\le d\le 5$), whereas a key hypothesis on the quasi-multiplicativity is proved in our companion paper.
  We further show that conditioned on $\{0 \leftrightarrow{} \partial B(N)\}$, the volume within $B(M)$ of the critical cluster containing $0$ is typically of order $M^{(\frac{d}{2}+1)\vee 4}$, regardless of how large $N$ is (provided with $N\gg M$). This phenomenon indicates that the critical cluster of GFF or loop soup exhibits self-similarity, which supports Werner's conjecture (2016) that such critical cluster has a scaling limit. Moreover, the exponent of the order $M^{(\frac{d}{2}+1)\vee 4}$ matches the conjectured fractal dimension of the scaling limit from Werner (2016).</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity, slimness, and minsize, on average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be $\delta$-hyperbolic if $d(x,y)+d(z,w)$ is at most $\max(d(x,z)+d(y,w), d(x,w)+d(y,z))$ by $2 \delta$. A geodesic space is $\delta$-slim if every geodesic triangle $\Delta(x,y,z)$ is $\delta$-slim. It is well-established that the notions of $\delta$-slimness, $\delta$-hyperbolicity, $\delta$-thinness and similar concepts are equivalent up to a constant factor. In this paper, we investigate these properties under an average-case framework and reveal a surprising discrepancy: while $\mathbb{E}\delta$-slimness implies $\mathbb{E}\delta$-hyperbolicity, the converse does not hold. Furthermore, similar asymmetries emerge for other definitions when comparing average-case and worst-case formulations of hyperbolicity. We exploit these differences to analyze the random Gaussian distribution in Euclidean space, random $d$-regular graph, and the random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph model, illustrating the implications of these average-case deviations.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Measure Distribution Function and Complex Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a planar domain $D$, the harmonic measure distribution function $h_D(r)$, with base point $z$, is the harmonic measure with pole at $z$ of the parts of the boundary which are within a distance $r$ of $z$. Equivalently it is the probability Brownian motion started from $z$ first strikes the boundary within a distance $r$ from $z$. We call $h_D$ the $h$-function of $D$, this function captures geometrical aspects of the domain, such as connectivity, or curvature of the boundary. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem: given a suitable function $h$, does there exist a domain $D$ such that $h = h_D$? To answer this, we first extend the concept of a $h$-function of a domain to one of a stopping time $\tau$ . By using the conformal invariance of Brownian motion we solve the inverse problem for that of a stopping time. The associated stopping time will be the projection of a hitting time of the real line. If this projection corresponds to the hitting time of a domain $D$, then this technique solves the original inverse problem. We have found a large family of examples such that the associated stopping time is that of a hitting time.</description>

      <title>Quantitative particle approximation of nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equations with singular kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive quantitative estimates for large stochastic systems of interacting particles perturbed by both idiosyncratic and environmental noises, as well as singular kernels. We prove that the (mollified) empirical process converges to the solution of the nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. The proof is based on It\^o's formula for $H_{q}^{1}$-valued process, commutator estimates, and some estimations for the regularization of the empirical measure. Moreover, we show that the aforementioned equation admits a unique strong solution in the probabilistic sense. The approach applies to repulsive and attractive kernels.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean GUE corners and Hecke modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of singular numbers for all principal corners of a Hermitian (resp. alternating) matrix with additive Haar distribution over a non-archimedean local field, the non-archimedean analogue of the GUE (resp. aGUE) corners process. In the alternating case we find that it is a Hall-Littlewood process, explaining -- and recovering as a corollary -- results of Fulman-Kaplan. In the Hermitian case we obtain a `marginal distribution' of a formal Hall-Littlewood process with both positive and negative transition `probabilities'. The proofs relate natural random matrix operations to structural results of Hironaka and Hironaka-Sato on modules over the spherical Hecke algebra, yielding other probabilistic statements of independent interest along the way.</description>

      <title>Zeros of conditional Gaussian analytic functions, random sub-unitary matrices and q-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate radial statistics of zeros of hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Functions (GAF) of the form $\varphi (z) = \sum_{k\ge 0} c_k z^k$ given that $|\varphi (0)|^2=t$ and assuming coefficients $c_k$ to be independent standard complex normals. We obtain the full conditional distribution of $N_q$, the number of zeros of $\varphi (z)$ within a disk of radius $\sqrt{q}$ centred at the origin, and prove its asymptotic normality in the limit when $q\to 1^{-}$, the limit that captures the entire zero set of $\varphi (z)$. In the same limit we also develop precise estimates for conditional probabilities of moderate to large deviations from normality. Finally, we determine the asymptotic form of $P_k(t;q)=\mathrm{Prob} \{ N_q= k | |\varphi(0)|^2=t \}$ in the limit when $k$ is kept fixed whilst $q$ approaches 1. To leading order, the hole probability $P_0(t;q)$ does not depend on $t$ for $t&gt;0$ but yet is different from that of $P_0(t=0;q)$ and coincides with the hole probability for unconditioned hyperbolic GAF of the form $\sum_{k\ge 0} \sqrt{k+1}\, c_k z^k$. We also find that asymptotically as $q \to 1^{-}$, $P_k(t;q)= e^t P_{k}(0;q)$ for every fixed $k \ge 1$ with $P_{k}(0;q)= \mathrm{Prob} \{ N_q =k-1 \}$.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value for rectangular random matrices with L\'evy entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=(x_{ij})\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ be a rectangular random matrix with i.i.d. entries (we assume $N/n\to\mathbf{a}&gt;1$), and denote by $\sigma_{min}(X)$ its smallest singular value. When entries have mean zero and unit second moment, the celebrated work of Bai-Yin and Tikhomirov show that $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sigma_{min}(X)$ converges almost surely to $\sqrt{\mathbf{a}}-1.$ However, little is known when the second moment is infinite. In this work we consider symmetric entry distributions satisfying $\mathbb{P}(|x_{ij}|&gt;t)\sim t^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in(0,2)$, and prove that $\sigma_{min}(X)$ can be determined up to a log factor with high probability: for any $D&gt;0$, with probability at least $1-n^{-D}$ we have $$C_1n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}(\log n)^\frac{5(\alpha-2)}{2\alpha}\leq \sigma_{min}(X)\leq C_2n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}(\log n)^\frac{\alpha-2}{2\alpha}$$ for some constants $C_1,C_2&gt;0$. This appears to be the first determination of $\sigma_{min}(X)$ in the $\alpha$-stable case with a correct leading order of $n$, as previous ant-concentration arguments only yield lower bound $n^\frac{1}{2}$. The same lower bound holds for $\sigma_{min}(X+B)$ for any fixed rectangular matrix $B$ with no assumption on its operator norm. The case of diverging aspect ratio is also computed. Geometrically, the lower bound shows that the random polytope $X^*(B_1^N)$ generated by heavy-tail distributions will with very high probability contain Euclidean balls $B_2^n$ of a much larger radius compared to its Gaussian counterpart.</description>

      <title>Stable and tempered stable distributions and processes: an overview toward trajectory simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable distributions are a celebrated class of probability laws used in various fields. The $\alpha$-stable process, and its exponentially tempered counterpart, the Classical Tempered Stable (CTS) process, are also prominent examples of L\'evy processes. Simulating these processes is critical for many applications, yet it remains computationally challenging, due to their infinite jump activity. This survey provides an overview of the key properties of these objects offering a roadmap for practitioners. The first part is a review of the stability property, sampling algorithms are provided along with numerical illustrations. Then CTS processes are presented, with the Baeumer-Meerschaert algorithm for increment simulation, and a computational analysis is provided with numerical illustrations across different time scales.</description>

      <title>Accuracy, Estimates, and Representation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06420v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measures of accuracy usually score how accurate a specified credence depending on whether the proposition is true or false. A key requirement for such measures is strict propriety; that probabilities expect themselves to be most accurate. We discuss characterisation results for strictly proper measures of accuracy.
  By making some restrictive assumptions, we present the proof of the characterisation result of Schervish (1989) in an accessible way. We will also present the characterisation in terms of Bregman divergences and the relationship between the two characterisations.
  The new contribution of the paper is to show that the Schervish form characterises proper measures of accuracy for estimates of random variables more generally, by offering a converse to Schervish, Seidenfeld, and Kadane (2014, Lemma 1). We also provide a Bregman divergence characterisation in the estimates setting, using the close relationship between the two forms.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent queue length distribution in queues fed by $K$ customers in a finite interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider queueing models, where customers arrive according to a continuous-time binomial process on a finite interval. In this arrival process, a total of $K$ customers arrive in the finite time interval $[0,T]$, where arrival times of those $K$ customers are independent and identically distributed according to an absolutely continuous distribution defined by its probability density function $f(t)$ on $(0,T]$. To analyze the time-dependent queue length distribution of this model, we introduce the auxiliary model with non-homogeneous Poisson arrivals and show that the time-dependent queue length distribution in the original model is given in terms of the time-dependent joint distribution of the numbers of arrivals and departures in the auxiliary model. Next, we consider a numerical procedure for computing the time-dependent queue length distribution in Markovian models with piecewise constant $f(t)$. A particular feature of our computational procedure is that the truncation error bound can be set as the input. Some numerical examples are also provided.</description>

      <title>A SIR epidemic model on a refining spatial grid II-Central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic SIR epidemic model taking into account the heterogeneity of the spatial environment is constructed. The deterministic model is given by a partial differential equation and the stochastic one by a space-time jump Markov process. The consistency of the two models is given by a law of large numbers. In this paper, we study the deviation of the spatial stochastic model from the deterministic model by a functional central limit theorem. The limit is a distribution-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian process, which is the mild solution of a stochastic partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>A family of log-correlated Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of log-correlated Gaussian processes indexed by metric spaces are introduced. Given a metric space so that the metric is a measure-definite kernel, a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H\in(0,1/2)$ is known to exist. A log-correlated Gaussian process then arises as the limit of fractional Brownian motions, as the Hurst index $H$ tends to zero, after a non-trivial random shift and then scaled by $H^{-1/2}$. When the index set is $\mathbb R_+$, for each $H\in(0,1/2)$ the shifted fractional Brownian motion is just a bi-fractional Brownian motion. This choice of shift corresponds to the decomposition of fractional Brownian motion as the sum of a bi-fractional Brownian motion and another smooth Gaussian process introduced by Lei and Nualart (2009), and the decomposition is known to have its counterparts for fractional Brownian motions indexed by metric spaces. The generalized processes when evaluated at a test function have stochastic-integral representations. The introduced processes are also shown to be the scaling limits of certain aggregated models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process $(\int_0^t e^{2b_s-b_t}\, ds\ ;\ t\ge 0)$ where $b$ is a real Brownian motion is known as the geometric 2M-X Matsumoto--Yor process, and it enjoys a miraculous Markov property. We provide a generalization of this process to the context of Jordan algebras, and we prove the Markov property.
  Our Markov process occurs as a limit of a sequence of Markov chains on the cone of squares which involve AX+B Markov chains whose invariant probability measures classically provide a Dufresne--type identity for a perpetuity. In particular, the paper gives in a generalization to any symmetric cones of the initial matrix generalization of Matsumoto--Yor process and Dufresne identity by Rider--Valko.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a strongly local Dirichlet form on a metric measure space that satisfies Gaussian heat kernel bounds, we show that the martingale dimension of the associated diffusion process coincides with Cheeger's analytic dimension of the underlying metric measure space. More precisely, we show that the pointwise version of the martingale dimension introduced by Hino (called the pointwise index) almost everywhere equals the pointwise dimension of the measurable differentiable structure constructed by Cheeger. Using known properties of spaces that admit a measurable differentiable structure, we show that the martingale dimension is bounded from above by Assouad dimension, thereby extending an earlier bound obtained by Hino for some self-similar sets.</description>

      <title>Limit distributions for polynomials with independent and identically distributed entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the limiting distributions of random variables of the form $P_n\left( (X_i)_{i \ge 1} \right)$, where: (i) $(P_n)_{n \ge 1}$ is a sequence of multivariate polynomials, each potentially involving countably many variables; (ii) there exists a constant $D \ge 1$ such that for all $n \ge 1$, the degree of $P_n$ is bounded above by $D$; (iii) $(X_i)_{i \ge 1}$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each with zero mean, unit variance, and finite moments of all orders. More specifically, we prove that the limiting distributions of these random variables can always be represented as the law of $P_\infty\left( (X_i, G_i)_{i \ge 1} \right)$, where $P_\infty$ is a polynomial of degree at most $D$ (potentially involving countably many variables), and $(G_i)_{i \ge 1}$ is a sequence of independent standard Gaussian random variables, which is independent of $(X_i)_{i \ge 1}$.
  We solve this problem in full generality, addressing both Gaussian and non-Gaussian inputs, and with no extra assumption on the coefficients of the polynomials. In the Gaussian case, our proof builds upon several original tools of independent interest, including a new criterion for central convergence based on the concept of maximal directional influence. Beyond asymptotic normality, this novel notion also enables us to derive quantitative bounds on the degree of the polynomial representing the limiting law. We further develop techniques regarding asymptotic independence and dimensional reduction. To conclude for polynomials with non-Gaussian inputs, we combine our findings in the Gaussian case with invariance principles.</description>

      <title>Cluster volumes for the Gaussian free field on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the volume of the critical clusters for the percolation of the level sets of the Gaussian free field on metric graphs. On $\mathbb{Z}^d$ below the upper-critical dimension $d=6$, we show that the largest such cluster in a box of side length $r$ has volume of order $r^{\frac{d+2}{2}}$, as conjectured by Werner in arXiv:2002.11487. This is in contrast to the mean-field regime $d&gt;6$, where this volume is of order $r^4$. We further obtain precise asymptotic tails for the volume of the critical cluster of the origin, and a lower bound on the tail of the volume of the near-critical cluster of the origin below the upper-critical dimension. Our proof extends to any graph with polynomial volume growth and polynomial decay of the Green's function as long as the critical one-arm probability decays as the square root of the Green's function, which is satisfied in low enough dimension.</description>

      <title>Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to both surplus providers and policyholders. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures as local equilibrium KMS states for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the study of statistical equilibria for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger and Hartree equations on the d-dimensional torus when d=1,2,3. Due to the focusing nature of the nonlinearity in these PDEs, Gibbs measures have to be appropriately localized. First, we show that these local Gibbs measures are stationary solutions for the Liouville probability density equation and that they satisfy a local equilibrium Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. Secondly, under some natural assumptions, we characterize all possible local KMS equilibrium states for these PDEs as local Gibbs measures.
  Our methods are based on Malliavin calculus in Gross-Stroock Sobolev spaces and on a suitable Gaussian integration by parts formula. To handle the technical problems due to localization, we rely on the works of Aida and Kusuoka on irreducibility of Dirichlet forms over infinite-dimensional domains. This leads us to the study of sublevel sets of the renormalized mass and their connectedness properties. In this paper, we also revisit Bourgain's proof of the normalizability of the local Gibbs measure for the focusing Hartree equation on the d-dimensional torus with d=2,3 by using concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-strong convergence orders of fully discrete schemes for the SPDE driven by L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that for a stochastic differential equation driven by L\'evy noise, the temporal H\"older continuity in $L^p$ sense of the exact solution does not exceed $1/p$. This leads to that the $L^p$-strong convergence order of a numerical scheme will vanish as $p$ increases to infinity if the temporal H\"older continuity of the solution process is directly used. A natural question arises: can one obtain the $L^p$-strong convergence order that does not depend on $p$? In this paper, we provide a positive answer for fully discrete schemes of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by L\'evy noise. Two cases are considered: the first is the linear multiplicative Poisson noise with $\nu(\chi)&lt;\infty$ and the second is the additive Poisson noise with $\nu(\chi)\leq\infty$, where $\nu$ is the L\'evy measure and $\chi$ is the mark set. For the first case, we present a strategy by employing the jump-adapted time discretization, while for the second case, we introduce the approach based on the recently obtained L\^e's quantitative John--Nirenberg inequality. We show that proposed schemes converge in $L^p$ sense with orders almost $1/2$ in both space and time for all $p\ge2$, which contributes novel results in the numerical analysis of the SPDE driven by L\'evy noise.</description>

      <title>Evolution of time-fractional stochastic hyperbolic diffusion equations on the unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the temporal evolution of a two-stage stochastic model for spherical random fields. The model uses a time-fractional stochastic hyperbolic diffusion equation, which describes the evolution of spherical random fields on $\bS^2$ in time. The diffusion operator incorporates a time-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. In the first stage of the model, a homogeneous problem is considered, with an isotropic Gaussian random field on $\bS^2$ serving as the initial condition. In the second stage, the model transitions to an inhomogeneous problem driven by a time-delayed Brownian motion on $\bS^2$. The solution to the model is expressed through a series of real spherical harmonics. To obtain an approximation, the expansion of the solution is truncated at a certain degree $L\geq1$. The analysis of truncation errors reveals their convergence behavior, showing that convergence rates are affected by the decay of the angular power spectra of the driving noise and the initial condition. In addition, we investigate the sample properties of the stochastic solution, demonstrating that, under some conditions, there exists a local H\"{o}lder continuous modification of the solution. To illustrate the theoretical findings, numerical examples and simulations inspired by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are presented.</description>

      <title>Large-sample analysis of cost functionals for inference under the coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coalescent is a foundational model of latent genealogical trees under neutral evolution, but suffers from intractable sampling probabilities. Methods for approximating these sampling probabilities either introduce bias or fail to scale to large sample sizes. We show that a class of cost functionals of the coalescent with recurrent mutation and a finite number of alleles converge to tractable processes in the infinite-sample limit. A particular choice of costs yields insight about importance sampling methods, which are a classical tool for coalescent sampling probability approximation. These insights reveal that the behaviour of coalescent importance sampling algorithms differs markedly from standard sequential importance samplers, with or without resampling. We conduct a simulation study to verify that our asymptotics are accurate for algorithms with finite (and moderate) sample sizes. Our results also facilitate the a priori optimisation of computational resource allocation for coalescent sequential importance sampling. We do not observe the same behaviour for importance sampling methods under the infinite sites model of mutation, which is regarded as a good and more tractable approximation of finite alleles mutation in most respects.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the smoothness of the density function of absolutely continuous measures supported on random self-similar sets on the line. We show that the natural projection of a measure with symbolic local dimension greater than 1 at every point is absolutely continuous with H\"older continuous density almost surely. In particular, if the similarity dimension is greater than 1 then the random self-similar set on the line contains an interior point almost surely.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been a go-to algorithm for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems arising in machine learning. Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties. We hereby present a full scope convergence study of biased nonconvex SGD, including weak convergence, function-value convergence and global convergence, and also provide subsequent convergence rates and complexities, all under relatively mild conditions in comparison with literature.</description>

      <title>Obstacle-aware Gaussian Process Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstacle-aware trajectory navigation is crucial for many systems. For example, in real-world navigation tasks, an agent must avoid obstacles, such as furniture in a room, while planning a trajectory. Gaussian Process (GP) regression, in its current form, fits a curve to a set of data pairs, with each pair consisting of an input point 'x' and its corresponding target regression value 'y(x)' (a positive data pair). However, to account for obstacles, we need to constrain the GP to avoid a target regression value 'y(x-)' for an input point 'x-' (a negative data pair). Our proposed approach, 'GP-ND' (Gaussian Process with Negative Datapairs), fits the model to the positive data pairs while avoiding the negative ones. Specifically, we model the negative data pairs using small blobs of Gaussian distribution and maximize their KL divergence from the GP. Our framework jointly optimizes for both positive and negative data pairs. Our experiments show that GP-ND outperforms traditional GP learning. Additionally, our framework does not affect the scalability of Gaussian Process regression and helps the model converge faster as the data size increases.</description>

      <title>On Random Batch Methods (RBM) for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, the underlying random fluctuations are non-Gaussian, particularly in contexts where heavy-tailed data distributions arise. A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for L\'evy noise, which accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch Method for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy noises (RBM-L\'evy), which can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et al. J Compt Phys, 2020]. In our RBM-L\'evy algorithm, $N$ particles are randomly grouped into small batches of size $p$, and interactions occur only within each batch for a short time. Then one reshuffles the particles and continues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by replacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force, RBM-L\'evy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original interacting particle system, even at the appearance of the L\'evy jump. We rigorously prove this convergence in Wasserstein distance, assuming either a finite or infinite second moment of the L\'evy measure. Some numerical examples are given to verify our convergence rate.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a study of the quasisymmetric uniformization of naturally arising random fractals and show that many of them fall outside the realm of quasisymmetric uniformization to simple canonical spaces. We begin with the trace, the graph of Brownian motion, and various variants of the Schramm-Loewner evolution $\mathrm{SLE}_\kappa$ for $\kappa&gt;0$, and show that a.s. neither is a quasiarc. After that, we study the conformal loop ensemble $\mathrm{CLE}_\kappa$, $\kappa \in (\frac{8}{3}, 4]$, and show that the collection of all points outside the loops is a.s. homeomorphic to the standard Sierpi\'nski carpet, but not quasisymmetrically equivalent to a round carpet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal exchange which can be formulated as a kind of optimal transportation problem. The existence of an optimal solution and a duality theorem for the optimal exchange problem are proved in case of completely regular topological spaces. We show the connection between the problem of optimal exchange and the optimal transportation problem with density constraints. With the use of this connection we obtain a formula for the optimal value in the problem of optimal exchange.</description>

      <title>Existence of subcritical percolation phases for generalised weight-dependent random connection models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a sufficient condition for the existence of a subcritical percolation phase for a wide range of continuum percolation models where each vertex is embedded into Euclidean space according to an iid-marked stationary Poisson point process. In contrast to many established models, the probability of existence of an edge may not only depend on the distance and the weights of its end vertices but also on a surrounding vertex set. Our results can be applied in particular to models combining heavy-tailed degree distributions and long-range effects, which are typically well connected. More precisely, we study the critical annulus-crossing intensity $\widehat{\lambda}_c$ which is smaller or equal to the classical critical percolation intensity $\lambda_c$ and derive sharp conditions for $\widehat{\lambda}_c&gt;0$ by controlling the occurrence of long edges. We further present tail bounds for the Euclidean diameter and number of points of the typical cluster in the subcritical phase and apply our results to several examples including some in which $\widehat{\lambda}_c&lt;\lambda_c$.</description>

      <title>Solving systems of Random Equations via First and Second-Order Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-based (a.k.a. `first order') optimization algorithms are routinely used to solve large scale non-convex problems. Yet, it is generally hard to predict their effectiveness. In order to gain insight into this question, we revisit the problem of solving $n$ random equations in $d$ variables. We assume that the equations are independent realizations of a common Gaussian process. A special case is the one of random polynomials, which has been studied since Littlewood-Offord and Kac in the 1940s, and Shub-Smale in the 1990s. The last authors first investigated the computational aspect of this problem. Smale's `17th problem' asks whether a system of random polynomial equations can be (approximately) solved in average-case polynomial time.
  We formulate this as a nonconvex optimization problem, and develop gradient and Hessian-based algorithms to solve it. Leveraging recent advances in spin glass theory, we characterize the optimal algorithm in this class, and show that it undergoes a phase transition when $\alpha=n/d$ crosses a threshold. For $\alpha&gt;\alpha_{\text{alg}}$ solutions may exist (depending on the distribution of the equations) but are not found by local algorithms. We compare these predictions with numerical experiments and observe that stochastic gradient descent approaches the optimal algorithm. We show that the geometry of solutions in a neighborhood of a random initialization undergoes a phase transition when $\alpha$ crosses a threshold $\alpha_{\text{sens}}$ (for `sensitivity') smaller than $\alpha_{\text{alg}}$. This geometric phase transition has algorithmic implications. Finally, we observe that the dynamics of these algorithms exhibits remarkable universality with respect to the details of the cost function.</description>

Abstract: This short note aims at complementing the results of the recent work arXiv:2302.05396, where Jahnel and L\"uchtrath investigate the question of existence of a subcritical percolation phase for the annulus-crossing probabilities in a large class of continuum percolation models, namely the classical or generalized weight-dependent random connection models. Their work relates the absence of a subcritical phase to the occurrence of long edges in the graph, through a somewhat indirect criterium, that stays inconclusive in some models of interest. We provide a more direct and arguably simpler criterium, that is always conclusive when considering classical weight-dependent random connection models.</description>

      <title>Strong survival and extinction for branching random walks via a new order for generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01565v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general discrete-time branching random walks on a countable set $X$. According to these processes, a particle at $x\in X$ generates a random number of children and places them at (some of) the sites of $X$, not necessarily independently nor with the same law at different starting vertices $x$.We introduce a new type of stochastic ordering of branching random walks, generalizing the germ order introduced by Hutchcroft in arXiv:2011.06402, which relies on the generating function of the process. We prove that given two branching random walks with law $\mathbf{\mu}$ and $\mathbf{\nu}$ respectively, with $\mathbf{\mu} \ge \mathbf{\nu}$, then in every set where there is extinction according to $\mathbf{\mu}$, there is extinction also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$. Moreover, in every set where there is strong local survival according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, there is strong local survival also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, provided that the supremum of the global extinction probabilities, for the $\mathbf{\nu}$-process, taken over all starting points $x$, is strictly smaller than 1. New conditions for survival and strong survival for inhomogeneous branching random walks are provided. We also extend a result of Moyal which claims that, under some conditions, the global extinction probability for a branching random walk is the only fixed point of its generating function, whose supremum over all starting coordinates, may be smaller than 1.</description>

      <title>Background risk model in presence of heavy tails under dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we examine two problems on applied probability, which are directly connected with the dependence in presence of heavy tails. The first problem, is related to max-sum equivalence of the randomly weighted sums in bi-variate set up. Introducing a new dependence, called Generalized Tail Asymptotic Independence, we establish the bi-variate max-sum equivalence, under a rather general dependence structure, when the primary random variables follow distributions from the intersection of the dominatedly varying and the long tailed distributions. On base of this max-sum equivalence, we provide a result about the asymptotic behavior of two kinds of ruin probabilities, over a finite time horizon, in a bi-variate renewal risk model, with constant interest rate. The second problem, is related to the asymptotic behavior of the Tail Distortion Risk Measure, in a static portfolio, called Background Risk Model. In opposite to other approaches on this topic, we use a general enough assumption, that is based on multivariate regular variation.</description>

Abstract: We derive Hanson-Wright inequalities for the quadratic form of a random vector with sparse independent components. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial approach to estimate the moments of the random quadratic form. In addition, we obtain a new Bernstein-type inequality for the sum of independent sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables. We present two applications with the sparse Hanson-Wright inequality: (1) Local law and complete eigenvector delocalization for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential Hermitian random matrices; (2) Concentration of the Euclidean norm for the linear transformation of a sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random vector.</description>

Abstract: By using coupling by change of conditional probability measure, the log-Harnack inequality for path dependent McKean-Vlasov SDEs with distribution dependent diffusion coefficients is established, which together with the exponential contractivity in $L^2$-Wasserstein distance yields the exponential contractivity in entropy-cost under the uniformly dissipative condition. When the coefficients are only partially dissipative, the exponential contractivity in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance is also derived in the aid of asymptotic reflection coupling, which is new even in the distribution independent case. In addition, the uniform in time propagation of chaos in $L^1$- Wasserstein distance is also obtained for path dependent mean field interacting particle system.</description>

Abstract: We present two sharp empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic processes with long memories, known as long memory processes, are ubiquitous in various science and engineering problems. Superposing Markovian stochastic processes generates a non-Markovian long memory process serving as powerful tools in several research fields, including physics, mathematical economics, and environmental engineering. We formulate two novel mathematical models of long memory process based on a superposition of interacting processes driven by jumps. The mutual excitation among the processes to be superposed is assumed to be of the mean field or aggregation form, where the former yields a more analytically tractable model. The statistics of the proposed long memory processes are investigated using their moment-generating function, autocorrelation, and associated generalized Riccati equations. Finally, the proposed models are applied to time series data of migrating fish counts at river observation points. The results of this study suggest that an exponential memory or a long memory model is insufficient; however, a unified method that can cover both is necessary to analyze fish migration, and our model is exactly the case.</description>

      <title>Singular mean-field backward stochastic Volterra integral equations in infinite dimensional spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of singular mean-field backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (MF-BSVIEs) in infinite-dimensional spaces. We consider the equation:
  \[X(t) = \Psi(t) + \int_t^b P\big(t, s, X(s), \aleph(t, s), \aleph(s, t), \mathbb{E}[X(s)], \mathbb{E}[\aleph(t, s)], \mathbb{E}[\aleph(s, t)]\big) ds - \int_t^b \aleph(t, s) dB_s, \]
  where the focus lies on establishing the existence and uniqueness of adapted M-solutions under appropriate conditions. A key contribution of this work is the development of essential lemmas that provide a rigorous foundation for analyzing the well-posedness of these equations. In addition, we extend our analysis to singular mean-field forward stochastic Volterra integral equations (MF-FSVIEs) in infinite-dimensional spaces, demonstrating their solvability and unique adapted solutions. Finally, we strengthen our theoretical results by applying them to derive stochastic maximum principles, showcasing the practical relevance of the proposed framework. These findings contribute to the growing body of research on mean-field stochastic equations and their applications in control theory and mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>On the Replica Symmetry of a Variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $N$ i.i.d. Ising spins with mean $m\in (-1,1)$ whose interactions are described by a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian with a quartic correction. This model was recently introduced by Bolthausen in \cite{Bolt2} as a toy model to understand whether a second moment argument can be used to derive the replica symmetric formula in the full high temperature regime if $m\neq 0$. In \cite{Bolt2}, Bolthausen suggested that a natural analogue of the de Almeida-Thouless condition for the toy model is
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:conj} \beta^2(1-m^2)^2\leq 1. \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, (1)\end{equation} Here, $\beta \geq 0$ corresponds to the inverse temperature. While the second moment method implies replica symmetry for $\beta $ sufficiently small, Bolthausen showed that the method fails to prove replica symmetry in the full region described by (1). A natural question that was left open in \cite{Bolt2} is whether (1) correctly characterizes the high temperature phase of the toy model. In this note, we show that this is indeed not the case. We prove that if $|m| \geq m_*$, for some $m_* \in (0,1)$, the limiting free energy of the toy model is negative for suitable $\beta $ that satisfy (1).</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a tractable sufficient condition for the consistency of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) in partially observed diffusion models, stated in terms of stationary distribution of the associated fully observed diffusion, under the assumption that the set of unknown parameter values is finite. This sufficient condition is then verified in the context of a latent price model of market microstructure, yielding consistency of maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters in this model. Finally, we compute the latter estimators using historical financial data taken from the NASDAQ exchange.</description>

      <title>What is the probability that a random symmetric tensor is close to rank-one?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the general problem of estimating the probability that a real symmetric tensor is close to rank-one tensors. Using Weyl's tube formula, we turn this question into a differential geometric one involving the study of metric invariants of the real Veronese variety. More precisely, we give an explicit formula for its reach and curvature coefficients with respect to the Bombieri-Weyl metric. These results are obtained using techniques from Random Matrix theory and an explicit description of the second fundamental form of the Veronese variety in terms of GOE matrices. Our findings give a complete solution to the original problem. In the case of rational normal curves it leads to a simple formula describing explicitly exponential decay with respect to the degree of the tensor.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Tensor Spaces via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The signature of a path is a sequence of tensors whose entries are iterated integrals, playing a key role in stochastic analysis and applications. The set of all signature tensors at a particular level gives rise to the universal signature variety. We show that the parametrization of this variety induces a natural decomposition of the tensor space via representation theory, and connect this to the study of path invariants. We also reveal certain constraints that apply to the rank and symmetry of a signature tensor.</description>

      <title>Stability of Sequential Lateration and of Stress Minimization in the Presence of Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential lateration is a class of methods for multidimensional scaling where a suitable subset of nodes is first embedded by some method, e.g., a clique embedded by classical scaling, and then the remaining nodes are recursively embedded by lateration. A graph is a lateration graph when it can be embedded by such a procedure. We provide a stability result for a particular variant of sequential lateration. We do so in a setting where the dissimilarities represent noisy Euclidean distances between nodes in a geometric lateration graph. We then deduce, as a corollary, a perturbation bound for stress minimization. To argue that our setting applies broadly, we show that a (large) random geometric graph is a lateration graph with high probability under mild conditions, extending a previous result of Aspnes et al (2006).</description>

      <title>Random Systems of Holomorphic Sections of a Sequence of Line bundles on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes a novel asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which, in terms of approximation theory, proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmically decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric density estimation for the small jumps of L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the density of the process associated with the small jumps of a pure jump L\'evy process, possibly of infinite variation, from discrete observations of one trajectory. The interest of such a question lies on the observation that even when the L\'evy measure is known, the density of the increments of the small jumps of the process cannot be computed in closed-form. We discuss results both from low and high frequency observations. In a low frequency setting, assuming the L\'evy density associated with the jumps larger than $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ in absolute value is known, a spectral estimator relying on the convolution structure of the problem achieves a parametric rate of convergence with respect to the integrated $L_2$ loss, up to a logarithmic factor. In a high frequency setting, we remove the assumption on the knowledge of the L\'evy measure of the large jumps and show that the rate of convergence depends both on the sampling scheme and on the behaviour of the L\'evy measure in a neighborhood of zero. We show that the rate we find is minimax up to a logarithmic factor. An adaptive penalized procedure is studied to select the cutoff parameter. These results are extended to encompass the case where a Brownian component is present in the L\'evy process. Furthermore, we illustrate numerically the performances of our procedures.</description>

      <title>On Smale's 17th problem over the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently solving a system of $n$ non-linear equations in ${\mathbb R}^d$. Addressing Smale's 17th problem stated in 1998, we consider a setting whereby the $n$ equations are random homogeneous polynomials of arbitrary degrees. In the complex case and for $n= d-1$, Beltr\'{a}n and Pardo proved the existence of an efficient randomized algorithm and Lairez recently showed it can be de-randomized to produce a deterministic efficient algorithm. Here we consider the real setting, to which previously developed methods do not apply. We describe a polynomial time algorithm that finds solutions (with high probability) for $n= d -O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ if the maximal degree is bounded by $d^2$ and for $n=d-1$ if the maximal degree is larger than $d^2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Weakly Coupled Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing the expected average reward obtained over an infinite time horizon by $n$ weakly coupled Markov decision processes. Our setup is a substantial generalization of the multi-armed restless bandit problem that allows for multiple actions and constraints. We establish a connection with a deterministic and continuous-variable control problem where the objective is to maximize the average reward derived from an occupancy measure that represents the empirical distribution of the processes when $n \to \infty$. We show that a solution of this fluid problem can be used to construct policies for the weakly coupled processes that achieve the maximum expected average reward as $n \to \infty$, and we give sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions. Under certain assumptions on the constraints, we prove that these conditions are automatically satisfied if the unconstrained single-process problem admits a suitable unichain and aperiodic policy. In particular, the assumptions include multi-armed restless bandits and a broad class of problems with multiple actions and inequality constraints. Also, the policies can be constructed in an explicit way in these cases. Our theoretical results are complemented by several concrete examples and numerical experiments, which include multichain setups that are covered by the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the maximal Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ is negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system, and (5) the transition operator of the system has the spectrum gap property on the space of Hoelder continuous functions with some exponent. Note that none of (1)--(5) can hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced Sample Complexity in Scenario-Based Control System Design via Constraint Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scenario approach is widely used in robust control system design and chance-constrained optimization, maintaining convexity without requiring assumptions about the probability distribution of uncertain parameters. However, the approach can demand large sample sizes, making it intractable for safety-critical applications that require very low levels of constraint violation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel yet simple constraint scaling method, inspired by large deviations theory. Under mild nonparametric conditions on the underlying probability distribution, we show that our method yields an exponential reduction in sample size requirements for bilinear constraints with low violation levels compared to the classical approach, thereby significantly improving computational tractability. Numerical experiments on robust pole assignment problems support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends deterministic notions of Strong Stability Preservation (SSP) to the stochastic setting, enabling nonlinearly stable numerical solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with pathwise solutions that remain unconditionally bounded. This approach may offer modelling advantages in data assimilation, particularly when the signal or data is a realization of an SPDE or PDE with a monotonicity property.</description>

      <title>Poissonian pair correlations for dependent random variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding explicit examples of sequences $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with Poissonian pair correlations (PPC) turns out to be a difficult problem. Therefore, this property is often studied in a random setting. While it is known that i.i.d. sequences of uniformly distributed random variables generically have Poissonian pair correlations, the case of dependent random variables has not been addressed in the literature yet. The present paper is the first contribution dealing with the dependent setting. More specifically, sequences of jittered samples and random walks on the torus are investigated. We show here that for the former class, the PPC property depends on how the finite sample is extended to an infinite sequence. Moreover, we prove that, under some mild assumptions, the random walk on the torus generically has PPC.</description>

      <title>Electricity Price Prediction Using Multi-Kernel Gaussian Process Regression combined with Kernel-Based Support Vector Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid model for predicting German electricity prices. The algorithm is based on combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). While GPR is a competent model for learning the stochastic pattern within the data and interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the tested German hourly power prices. However, since the out-of-sample prediction depends on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is made using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization, having an advantage in dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. Both individual predictions are later combined using the performance-based weight assignment method. A test on historic German power prices shows that this approach outperforms its chosen benchmarks such as the autoregressive exogenous model, the naive approach, as well as the long short-term memory approach of prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general partially observed diffusion model with periodic coefficients and with non-degenerate diffusion component. The coefficients of such a model depend on an unknown (static and deterministic) parameter which needs to be estimated based on the observed component of the diffusion process. We show that, under a minimal assumption of identifiability, and given enough regularity of the diffusion coefficients, a maximum likelihood estimator of the unknown parameter converges to the true parameter value as the sample size grows to infinity.</description>
