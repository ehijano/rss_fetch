      <title>The Lebesgue measure of boundaries of multigeometric Cantorvals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the boundary of every multigeometric Cantorval is a null set, and extend this result to a larger class of standard achievable Cantorvals. In addition, we discuss the sets of uniqueness of achievement sets and show that they always belong to the Borel class $\mathcal{G}_\delta$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic System of Neurons on a Complete Graph: Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The net of N ``physical'' neurons is considered as a dynamical system. These neurons form a complete graph. The state of any neuron is its electric potential. The potential linearly increases until reaches its maximal value. Then it falls to zero and the neuron sends spikes to all other neurons. Having got a spike any neuron changes its state by some given function. We study the problem of a synchronization of the net. We glue the maximal value of potential to zero and so consider the state of any neuron as a point on the circle. We prove that under some conditions the states of neurons considered as points on the circle finally (when time turns to infinity) form a set which is time-invariant modulo its uniform rotation along the circle.</description>

      <title>The dynamics around the collinear points of the elliptic three-body problem: A normal form approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the collinear points in the planar, restricted three-body problem, assuming that the primaries move on an elliptic orbit around a common barycenter. The equations of motion can be conveniently written in a rotating pulsating barycentric frame, taking the true anomaly as independent variable. We consider the Hamiltonian modeling this problem in the extended phase space and we imple ment a normal form to make a center manifold reduction. The normal form provides an approximate solution for the Cartesian coordinates, which allows us to construct several kinds of orbits, most notably planar and vertical Lyapunov orbits, and halo orbits. We compare the analytical results with a numerical simulation, which requires special care in the selection of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the spin-spin problem in Celestial Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates different models of rotational dynamics of two rigid bodies with the shape of an ellipsoid, moving under their gravitational influence. The focus of this study is on their behavior, their linear stability, and numerical investigation of the main resonances. We assume that the spin axes of the two bodies are perpendicular to the orbital plane and coinciding with the direction of their shortest physical axis. In the basic approximation, we assume that the orbits of the centers of mass are Keplerian and we retain the lowest order of the potential, according to which the rotational motions of the two bodies are decoupled, the so-called spin-orbit problem. When considering highest order approximation of the potential, the rotational motions become coupled giving rise to the so-called spin-spin problem. Finally, we release the assumption that the orbit is Keplerian, which implies that the rotational dynamics is coupled to the variation of the orbital elements. The resulting system is called the full spin-spin problem. We also consider the above models under the assumption that one or both bodies are non rigid; the dissipative effect is modeled by a linear function of the rotational velocity, depending on some dissipative and drift coefficients. We consider three main resonances, namely the (1:1,1:1), (3:2,3:2), (1:1,3:2) resonances and we start by analyzing the linear stability of the equilibria in the conservative and dissipative settings (after averaging and keeping only the resonant angle), showing that the stability depends on the value of the orbital eccentricity. By a numerical integration of the equations of motion, we compare the spin-orbit and spin-spin problems to highlight the influence of the coupling term of the potential in the conservative and dissipative case...</description>

      <title>Density of orbits of horocycle flows at sub-quadratic polynomial times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subset PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ be such that the space $X=\Gamma\backslash PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ is not compact. Let $(h_t)$ be the horocycle flow acting on $X$. We show that for every $x\in X$ that is not periodic for $(h_t)$ and for every $\delta\in (0,1)$ the orbit $\{h_{n^{2-\delta}}x\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is dense in $X$. Assuming additionally the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture we show that for every non-periodic $x\in X$, $\{h_{p}x\}_{p- \text{prime}}$ is dense in $X$. Finally we show that for $\Gamma=PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, $\{h_{n^2}y_q\}_{n&lt;q}$ equidistribute, as $q\to \infty$ along primes congruent to $1 \pmod{4}$, towards Haar measure, where $\{y_q\}$ is a sequence of periodic points of period $q$.</description>

      <title>Topological stability from a measurable viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the {\em $\mu$-topological stability}. This is a type of stability depending on the measure $\mu$ different from the set-valued approach \cite{lm}. We prove that the map $f$ is $m_p$-topologically stable if and only if $p$ is a topologically stable point ($m_p$ is the Dirac measure supported on $p$). On closed manifolds of dimension $\geq2$ we prove that every $\mu$-topologically stable map has the $\mu$-shadowing property for finitely supported measures $\mu$. Moreover the $\mu$-topological stability is invariant under topological conjugacy or restriction to compact invariant sets of full measure. We also prove for expansive maps that the set of measures $\mu$ for which the map is $\mu$-topologically stable is convex. We analyze the relationship between $\mu$-topological stability for absolutely continuous measures. In the nonatomic case we show that the $\mu$-topological stability implies the set-valued stability approach in \cite{lm}. Finally, we show that every expansive map with the weak $\mu$-shadowing property (c.f. \cite{lr}) is $\mu$-topologically stable.</description>

      <title>Mean Diameter, Regularity and Diam-Mean Equicontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of (not necessarily minimal) actions, we consider the mean diameter and use it to characterize regular factor maps. Building on this characterization, we prove that an action is diam-mean equicontinuous if and only if it is a regular extension of its maximal equicontinuous factor. Furthermore, we establish the existence of a maximal diam-mean equicontinuous factor and discuss stability properties of regular factor maps. For this, we work in the context of actions of locally compact and $\sigma$-compact amenable groups.</description>

      <title>Geometric Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a conceptual and historical review of the evolution of integrable Hamiltonian systems from the Moscow School of A. T. Fomenko to the emerging Azarbaijan School of Geometric Dynamical Systems founded by the author. Beginning with the topological classification of integrable systems through Liouville foliations, atoms, and molecular invariants, the paper traces how these geometric ideas evolved into modern frameworks based on Lie groupoids, Lie algebroids, and fractional calculus. The author s doctoral dissertation at Moscow State University extended 2004 the Fomenko theory to new integrable systems on so(4), constructing novel topological molecules and describing the hierarchy of singularities and bifurcations. Upon his return to Iran, he established a comprehensive research program at Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University, integrating topology, geometry, and analysis to form a coherent Iranian branch of the global theory of integrable systems. This program unifies the classical and the modern: from the Euler Poincare and Hamilton Jacobi formalisms on Lie groupoids and algebroids, to fractional and quantum mechanical models involving Hopf and C algebras. The paper emphasizes conceptual synthesis over computation, showing how integrable geometry has transformed from a purely mechanical theory into a universal language connecting topology, control theory, and quantum structures.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of twisted solutions in a continuum limit for the Kuramoto model on nearest neighbor graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of twisted solutions in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators defined on nearest neighbor graphs, which may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, when it may have phase-lag. We use the center manifold reduction, which is a standard technique in dynamical systems theory, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of twisted solutions becomes unstable and a stable or unstable two-parameter family of modulated twisted solutions that oscillate or not depending on whether the phase-lag exists or not is born. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM on deterministic dense, random dense and random sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-local Dirichlet forms, Gibbs measures, and a Hodge theorem for Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I study properties of the generators $\triangle_\gamma$ of non-local Dirichlet forms $\mathcal{E}^\mu_\gamma$ on ultrametric spaces which are the path space of simple stationary Bratteli diagrams. The measures used to define the Dirichlet forms are taken to be the Gibbs measures $\mu_\psi$ associated to H\"older continuous potentials $\psi$ for one-sided shifts. I also define a cohomology $H_{lc}(X_B)$ for $X_B$ which can be seen as dual to the homology of Bowen and Franks. Besides studying spectral properties of $\triangle_\gamma$, I show that for $\gamma$ large enough (with sharp bounds depending on the diagram and the measure theoretic entropy $h_{\mu_\psi}$ of $\mu_\psi$) there is a unique harmonic representative of any class $c\in H_{lc}(X_B)$.</description>

      <title>A dynamical algorithm to compute hyperbolic Julia sets in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic Julia sets of complex polynomials are known to be computable in polynomial time due to pioneering work of Braverman in 2005 (10.1016/j.entcs.2004.06.031). In this paper, we present an alternative method for establishing poly-time computability of hyperbolic Julia sets, which allows us to establish, via a new algorithm, lower computability of the hyperbolicity locus of polynomials of a fixed degree. We first adapt our recently developed algorithms for the computability of polynomial skew products (preprint available arXiv.2508.08033) and then apply a refinement that allows us to establish poly-time computation of hyperbolic Julia sets. Finally, we derive lower computability of the hyperbolicity locus via an adapted lattice/refinement search algorithm. In contrast to Braverman's 2005 algorithm/proof, our approach is dynamical in nature and does not rely on techniques unique to complex analysis.</description>

      <title>The entropic central limit theorem for stochastic integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic stability of finite-dimensional stochastic integrable Hamiltonian systems via information entropy. Specifically, we establish the asymptotic vanishing of Shannon entropy difference (with correction for the lattice interval length) and relative entropy between the partial sum of discretized frequency sequence and its quantized Gaussian approximation (expectation and covariance variance matched). These two convergence are logically consistent with the second law of thermodynamics: the complexity of the system has reached the theoretical limit, and the orbits achieve a global unbiased coverage of the invariant tori with the most thorough chaotic behavior, their average winding rate along the tori stays fixed at the corresponding expected value of the frequency sequence, while deviations from this average follow isotropic Gaussian dynamics, much like Wiener process around a fixed trajectory. This thus provides an information-theoretic quantification of how orbital complexity ensures the persistence of invariant tori beyond mere convergence of statistical distributions (as stated in the classical central limit theorem).</description>

      <title>Periodic event-triggered impulsive control for fully heterogeneous stochastic multi-agent systems with a time-varying topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a periodic event-triggered impulsive control (PETIC) for fully heterogeneous stochastic multi-agent systems (MASs) with a time-varying topology. Firstly, a novel time-varying topology is established by incorporating the energy consumption of each agent. This topology enables active adjustment of the information interaction intensity between agents. Secondly, to address the difficulties that agents with different dimensions cannot communicate in fully heterogeneous stochastic MASs, a virtual state space is designed. According to the above framework, novel PETICs with/without actuation delays are presented to achieve the mean-square exponential consensus of fully heterogeneous stochastic MASs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through a numerical simulation of unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the limit set of non-autonomous IFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractals are ubiquitous in nature, and since Mandelbrot's seminal insight into their structure, there has been growing interest in them. While the topological properties of the limit sets of IFSs have been studied -- notably in the pioneering work of Hata -- many aspects remain poorly understood, especially in the non-autonomous setting. In this paper, we present a homological framework which captures the structure of the limit set. We apply our novel abstract theory to the concrete analysis of the so-called fractal square, and provide an answer to a variant of Mandelbrot's percolation problem. This work offers new insights into the topology of fractals.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures on the space of measured laminations for subgroups of mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-elementary subgroup of the mapping class group of a surface, we study its invariant Radon measures on the space of measured laminations, by classifying them on the recurrent measured laminations. In particular, given a divergence-type subgroup, we show the uniquely ergodic by explicitly constructing the ergodic measure. This generalizes Lindenstrauss--Mirzakhani's result and Hamenst\"adt's result for the full mapping class group, in which case the ergodic measure is the Thurston measure. As a special case, we deduce that for a convex cocompact subgroup, every invariant ergodic Radon measure on the space of all measured laminations is either the unique measure on recurrent measured laminations, or a counting measure on the orbit of a non-recurrent measured lamination.
  Our method is geometric and does not rely on continuous or homogeneous flows on the ambient space or a dynamical system associated with a finite measure space. This leads to a unifying approach for various metric spaces, including Teichm\"uller spaces and partially $\operatorname{CAT}(-1)$ spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a product of rank-one simple real algebraic groups and let $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a Zariski dense Anosov subgroup, or relatively Anosov subgroup. In this paper, we prove a complete classification of invariant Radon measures for the maximal horospherical action on $\Gamma \backslash G$. In particular, when $\Gamma$ is Anosov, this solves the open problems proposed by Landesberg--Lee--Lindenstrauss--Oh for $\operatorname{rank} G \le 3$, and by Oh in general.
  More generally, we consider the horospherical foliation of a product of $\operatorname{CAT}(-1)$ spaces, and present a classification of Radon measures supported on a recurrent subfoliation that are invariant under the action of transverse subgroups.</description>

Abstract: Koopman operators provide a linear framework for data-driven analyses of nonlinear dynamical systems, but their infinite-dimensional nature presents major computational challenges. In this article, we offer an introductory guide to Koopman learning, emphasizing rigorously convergent data-driven methods for forecasting and spectral analysis. We provide a unified account of error control via residuals in both finite- and infinite-dimensional settings, an elementary proof of convergence for generalized Laplace analysis -- a variant of filtered power iteration that works for operators with continuous spectra and no spectral gaps -- and review state-of-the-art approaches for computing continuous spectra and spectral measures. The goal is to provide both newcomers and experts with a clear, structured overview of reliable data-driven techniques for Koopman spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Control of neural field equations with step-function inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wilson-Cowan and Amari-type models capture nonlinear neural population dynamics, providing a fundamental framework for modeling how sensory and other exogenous inputs shape activity in neural tissue. We study the controllability properties of Amari-type neural fields subject to piecewise/constant-in-time inputs. The model describes the time evolution of the polarization of neural tissue within a spatial continuum, with synaptic interactions represented by a convolution kernel. We study the synthesis of piecewise/constant-in-time inputs to achieve two-point boundary-type control objectives, namely, steering neural activity from an initial state to a prescribed target state. This approach is particularly relevant for predicting the emergence of paradoxical neural representations, such as discordant visual illusions that occur in response to overt sensory stimuli. We first present a control synthesis based on the Banach fixed-point theorem, which yields an iterative construction of a constant-in-time input under minimal regularity assumptions on the kernel and transfer function; however, it exhibits practical limitations, even in the linear case. To overcome these challenges, we then develop a generic synthesis framework based on the flow of neural dynamics drift, enabling explicit piecewise constant and constant-in-time inputs. Extensive numerical results in one and two spatial dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed syntheses and demonstrate their superior performance compared to inputs derived from naive linearization at the initial or target states when these states are not equilibria of the drift dynamics. By providing a mathematically rigorous framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields, this work advances our understanding of nonlinear neural population control with potential applications in computational neuroscience, psychophysics, and neurostimulation.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a class of slow--fast systems of rough partial differential equations defined over a monotone family of interpolation Hilbert spaces. By employing the controlled rough path framework tailored to a monotone family of interpolation spaces, together with a time discretization argument, we demonstrate that the slow component strongly converges to the solution of the averaged system in the supremum norm as the time-scale parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to $0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey recent work done on the values at integer points of irrational inhomogeneous quadratic forms, namely, inhomogeneous analogues of the famous Oppenheim conjecture. We also prove that the set of such forms in two variables whose set of values at integer points avoids a given countable set not containing zero, has full Hausdorff dimension. Moreover, we consider the more refined variant of this problem, where the shift is fixed and the form is allowed to vary. The strategy is to translate the problems to homogeneous dynamics and deduce the theorems from their dynamical counterparts. While our approach is inspired by the work of Kleinbock and Weiss, the dynamical results can be deduced from more general results of An, Guan, and Kleinbock.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A special 2D initial conditions' domain of the equal-mass zero angular momentum planar three-body problem, which has been formerly studied, is analyzed to deepen the knowledge of the stability regions in it. The decay times in the domain are carefully computed. Four stability regions are established. 971 verified initial conditions for linearly stable periodic collisionless orbits are found. Many of these identified initial conditions are new ones. The periodic orbits of each stability region are characterized by a certain pattern in their syzygy sequences. Additional computations show that the orbits found should be considered as candidates for KAM-stable orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models. To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Function Iteration Method: A New Framework for Solving Periodic Solutions of Non-linear and Non-smooth Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing accurate periodic responses in strongly nonlinear or even non-smooth vibration systems remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Existing numerical methods, such as the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and the Shooting Method (SM), have achieved notable success but face intrinsic limitations when applied to complex, high-dimensional, or non-smooth systems. A key bottleneck is the construction of Jacobian matrices for the associated algebraic equations; although numerical approximations can avoid explicit analytical derivation, they become unreliable and computationally expensive for large-scale or non-smooth problems. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the Perturbation Function Iteration Method (PFIM), a novel framework built upon perturbation theory. PFIM transforms nonlinear equations into time-varying linear systems and solves their periodic responses via a piecewise constant approximation scheme. Unlike HBM, PFIM avoids the trade-off between Fourier truncation errors and the Gibbs phenomenon in non-smooth problems by employing a basis-free iterative formulation, while significantly simplifying the Jacobian computation. Extensive numerical studies, including self-excited systems, parameter continuation, systems with varying smoothness, and high-dimensional finite element models, demonstrate that PFIM achieves quadratic convergence in smooth systems and maintains robust linear convergence in highly non-smooth cases. Moreover, comparative analyses show that, for high-dimensional non-smooth systems, PFIM attains solutions of comparable accuracy with computational costs up to two orders of magnitude lower than HBM. These results indicate that PFIM provides a robust and efficient alternative for periodic response analysis in complex nonlinear dynamical systems, with strong potential for practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A Galois Criterion for Good Reduction via Orbital Arboreal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let K be a non-archimedean local field and phi: P^1 -&gt; P^1 a rational endomorphism of degree d &gt;= 2 defined over K. We relate the reduction of phi to the Galois action on its preimage towers by introducing the *orbital colimit* G_{O+(x)} := colim_n Im(rho_{phi^n(x)}), a canonical Galois object encoding the dynamics along a forward orbit. Our main theorem (Theorem 3.1) gives a precise equivalence: phi has *strict good reduction* if and only if there exists a nonempty open set of integral points x in P^1(O_K) whose reductions avoid the reduced postcritical set PC(tilde{phi}), such that the reduced level-1 fibers have degree d and are etale -- equivalently, the associated fiber polynomials have unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, for every such x, the extensions K(X_n(x))/K are unramified for all n &gt;= 1. This yields a dynamical Neron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion in arboreal terms, valid on the natural open locus. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over Q_p.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for stochastic fractional evolution equations with Caputo time fractional derivative of order $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ and space variable coefficients on an unbounded domain. The space derivatives that appear in the equations are of integer or fractional order such as the left and the right Liouville fractional derivative as well as the Riesz fractional derivative. To solve the problem we use generalized uniformly continuous solution operators. We obtain the unique solution within a certain Colombeau generalized stochastic process space. In our solving procedure, instead of the originate problem we solve a certain approximate problem, where operators of the original and the approximate problem are $L^2$-associated. Finally, application of the theory in solving stochastic time and time-space fractional wave equation is shown.</description>

Abstract: In this article we investigate the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for a proper metric space endowed with a proper action by isometries of a group with a contracting element. We show that the existence of a contracting isometry is a sufficient evidence of negative curvature to carry in this context various results borrowed from hyperbolic geometry. In particular, we extend the so-called Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy proving that the geodesic flow is either conservative and ergodic or dissipative.</description>

      <title>The $\beta$-transformation with a hole at $0$: the general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\beta&gt;1$, let $T_\beta$ be the $\beta$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$, defined by $T_\beta(x)=\beta x-\lfloor \beta x\rfloor$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_\beta(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_\beta(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the interval $[0,t)$. Kalle et al.~[{\em Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems} {\bf 40} (2020), no.~9, 2482--2514] considered the case $\beta\in(1,2]$. They studied the set-valued bifurcation set $\mathscr{E}_\beta:=\{t\in[0,1): K_\beta(t')\ne K_\beta(t)~\forall t'&gt;t\}$ and proved that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_\beta(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. In a previous paper [{\em Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems} {\bf 43} (2023), no.~6, 1785--1828] we determined, for all $\beta\in(1,2]$, the critical value $\tau(\beta):=\min\{t&gt;0: \eta_\beta(t)=0\}$. The purpose of the present article is to extend these results to all $\beta&gt;1$. In addition to calculating $\tau(\beta)$, we show that (i) the function $\tau: \beta\mapsto\tau(\beta)$ is left continuous on $(1,\infty)$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $\tau$ has no downward jumps; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,\infty)$, whose complement $(1,\infty)\backslash O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $\tau$ is real-analytic, strictly convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. We also prove several topological properties of the bifurcation set $\mathscr{E}_\beta$. The key to extending the results from $\beta\in(1,2]$ to all $\beta&gt;1$ is an appropriate generalization of the Farey words that are used to parametrize the connected components of the set $O$. Some of the original proofs from the above-mentioned papers are simplified.</description>

      <title>Dimensions and dimension spectra of Non-autonomous iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-autonomous iterated function systems are a generalization of iterated function systems. If the contractions in the system are conformal mappings, it is called a non-autonomous conformal iterated function system, and its attractor is called a non-autonomous conformal set. In this paper, we study intermediate dimension spectra of non-autonomous conformal sets which provide a unifying framework for Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions. First, we obtain the intermediate dimension spectra formula of non-autonomous conformal sets by using upper and lower topological pressures. As a consequence, we obtain simplified forms of their Hausdorff, packing and box dimensions. Finally, we explore the Hausdorff dimensions of the non-autonomous infinite conformal iterated function systems which consists of countably many conformal mappings at each level, and we provide the Hausdorff dimension formula under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions to continuous and discrete first-order linear matrix equations with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study continuous and discrete linear delay systems given respectively by \[ \dot{X}(\xi) = A_0 X(\xi) + X(\xi)A_1 + B_0 X(\xi-\sigma) + X(\xi-\sigma)B_1 + G(\xi), \] and its discrete analogue \[ X(u+1) = A_0 X(u) + X(u)A_1 + B_0 X(u-m) + X(u-m)B_1 + G(u), \] where \(A_0, A_1, B_0, B_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) are constant noncommuting matrices, and \(\sigma&gt;0\), \(m \in \mathbb{N}\) denote the delay parameters. The main objective is to generalize the classical results of \cite{diblik1, diblik2} and to provide explicit representations of the solutions. For this purpose, we present generalized delayed exponential-type systems for both continuous and discrete cases. This approach allows us to remove the restrictive commutativity conditions \(B_1G(\xi)=G(\xi)B_1\) and \(B_1\Psi(\xi)=\Psi(\xi)B_1\) imposed in \cite{diblik1, diblik2}, thus obtaining explicit solution formulas for more general classes of systems.</description>

      <title>Attractors for the Wave Equation with Nonlinear Energy Critical Sources and Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wave equation with energy-critical nonlinear sources and dissipation in 3 D is considered. It is shown that the resulting dynamical system admits a global attractor. Under the additional assumption of strong monotonicity of the damping at the origin, the said attractor is also finite dimensional and smooth. In order to handle \enquote{energy criticality} of both sources and the damping, the methods used depend on enhanced dissipation \cite{Bociu-lasiecka-jde}, energy {\it identity} for weak solutions \cite{Koch-lasiecka}, an adaptation of Ball's method \cite{ball}, and the theory of quasi-stable systems \cite{chueshov-white}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparator-overdrive-delay conditioning is a new control conditioning approach for high-frequency current-mode control. No existing literature rigorously studies the effect of the comparator overdrive delay on the current-mode control. The results in this paper provide insights into the mechanism of comparator-overdrive-delay conditioning.</description>

      <title>Density combinatorics theorems in fractal dimension theory of continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build a bridge from density combinatorics to dimension theory of continued fractions. We establish a fractal transference principle that transfers common properties of subsets of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density to properties of subsets of irrationals in $(0,1)$ for which the set $\{a_n(x)\colon n\in\mathbb N\}$ of partial quotients induces an injection $n\in\mathbb N\mapsto a_n(x)\in\mathbb N$. Let $(*)$ be a certain property that holds for any subset of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density. The principle asserts that for any subset $S$ of $\mathbb N$ with positive upper density, there exists a set $E_S$ of Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ such that the set $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}\bigcap_{x\in E_S}\{a_n(x)\}\cap S$ has the same upper density as that of $S$, and thus inherits property $(*)$. Examples of $(*)$ include the existence of arithmetic progressions of arbitrary lengths and the existence of arbitrary polynomial progressions, known as Szemer\'edi's and Bergelson-Leibman's theorems respectively. In the same spirit, we establish a relativized version of the principle applicable to the primes, to the primes of the form $y^2+z^2+1$, to the sets given by the Piatetski-Shapiro sequences.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking with High-Order Lie Bracket Approximations: Achieving Exponential Decay Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the further development of the Lie bracket approximation approach for extremum seeking systems. Classical results in this area provide extremum seeking algorithms with exponential convergence rates for quadratic-like cost functions, and polynomial decay rates for cost functions of higher degrees. This paper proposes a novel control design approach that ensures the motion of the extremum seeking system along directions associated with higher-order Lie brackets, thereby ensuring exponential convergence for cost functions that are polynomial-like but with degree greater than two.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Identifying Weakly Chaotic, Strongly Chaotic, Resonant and Non-resonant Orbits in the Generalized Kicked Rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the types of orbits is an important topic in the study of chaotic dynamical systems. Beyond the well-known distinctly chaotic and regular motions, we focus on dynamics occurring in regions where regular and chaotic motions coexist and intertwine, which potentially indicating weakly chaotic orbits. This intermediate regime lies between strongly chaotic dynamics, characterized by exponential sensitivity and completely non-chaotic, purely regular behavior. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to identify the types of orbits in the generalized kicked rotator system, which is challenging to study due to its complex and mixed chaotic behaviors. Our deep learning framework can be divided into two steps. First, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates the weighted Birkhoff average, the Lyapunov exponent, and the correlation dimension to identify weakly chaotic orbits. The algorithm categorizes orbits into four types: weakly chaotic, strongly chaotic, and regular orbits (which are further subdivided into resonant and non-resonant orbits), thereby creating a valuable dataset required for deep learning models. Second, we demonstrate that a well-trained 2D-CNN achieves high performance in accurately classifying orbits, largely because it effectively leverages the 2D structural information of the phase space relation. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify weakly chaotic orbits using deep learning methods. The method can be easily extend to other models.</description>
