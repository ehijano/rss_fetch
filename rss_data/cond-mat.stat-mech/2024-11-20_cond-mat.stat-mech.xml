      <title>Hilbert space geometry and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the Hilbert space geometry of the eigenstates of a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian. In recent years, the QGT and related quantities have found extensive theoretical and experimental utility, in particular for quantifying quantum phase transitions both at and out of equilibrium. Here we consider the symmetric part (quantum Riemannian metric) of the QGT for various multi-parametric random matrix Hamiltonians and discuss the possible indication of ergodic or integrable behaviour. We found for a two-dimensional parameter space that, while the ergodic phase corresponds to the smooth manifold, the integrable limit marks itself as a singular geometry with a conical defect. Our study thus provides more support for the idea that the landscape of the parameter space yields information on the ergodic-nonergodic transition in complex quantum systems, including the intermediate phase.</description>

      <title>Spectral Coarse-Graining and Rescaling for Preserving Structural and Dynamical Properties in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a graph renormalization procedure based on the coarse-grained Laplacian, which generates reduced-complexity representations for characteristic scales identified through the spectral gap. This method retains both diffusion probabilities and large-scale topological structures, while reducing redundant information, facilitating the analysis of large graphs by decreasing the number of vertices. Applied to graphs derived from EEG recordings of human brain activity, our approach reveals macroscopic properties emerging from neuronal interactions, such as collective behavior in the form of coordinated neuronal activity. Additionally, it shows dynamic reorganization of brain activity across scales, with more generalized patterns during rest and more specialized and scale-invariant activity in the occipital lobe during attention-focused tasks.</description>

      <title>Long-time Freeness in the Kicked Top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Special Relativistic Liouville Equation Completed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two previous papers, the author raised the possibility of a special relativistic Liouville equation. The conclusion then was yes, such an equation is possible in 8N phase space if a Lorentz-invariant Universal (LiU) time can be defined for all the degrees of freedom. Without this LiU time, the existence of a special relativistic Liouville equation is empty and may just be a waste of time. In this paper, I propose and argue that the LiU time follows from entropy, which should not be surprising given the second law of thermodynamics and the fact that regardless of how temperature and heat transform under Lorentz transformation, the entropy is invariant. Thus, it is natural to define LiU time from entropy.This now completes the existence of a special relativistic Liouville equation, which will determine the Gibbs distribution, the starting point of classical statistical mechanical description of physical systems. To illustrate the formalism, the partition function for the relativistic ideal gas is derived. The result is much simpler than the Juttner gas result.</description>

      <title>The impact of stochastic resetting on resource allocation: The case of Reallocating geometric Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of stochastic resetting on the Reallocating geometric Brownian motion (RGBM), an established model for resource redistribution relevant to systems such as population dynamics, evolutionary processes, economic activity, and even cosmology. The RGBM model is inherently non-stationary and non-ergodic, leading to complex resource redistribution dynamics. By introducing stochastic resetting, which periodically returns the system to a predetermined state, we examine how this mechanism modifies RGBM behavior. Our analysis uncovers distinct long-term regimes determined by the interplay between the resetting rate, the strength of resource redistribution, and standard geometric Brownian motion parameters: the drift and the noise amplitude. Notably, we identify a critical resetting rate beyond which the self-averaging time becomes effectively infinite. In this regime, the first two moments are stationary, indicating a stabilized distribution of an initially unstable, mean-repulsive process. We demonstrate that optimal resetting can effectively balance growth and redistribution, reducing inequality in the resource distribution. These findings help us understand better the management of resource dynamics in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Micro and Nanoscale Systems in the Weak-Memory Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory effects are ubiquitous in small-scale systems. They emerge from interactions between accessible and inaccessible degrees of freedom and give rise to evolution equations that are non-local in time. If the characteristic time scales of accessible and inaccessible degrees of freedom are sharply separated, locality can be restored through the standard Markov approximation. Here, we show that this approach can be rigorously extended to a well-defined weak-memory regime, where the relevant time scales can be of comparable order of magnitude. We derive explicit bounds on the error of the local approximation and a convergent perturbation scheme for its construction. Being applicable to any non-local time evolution equation that is autonomous and linear in the variables of interest, our theory provides a unifying framework for the systematic description of memory effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of micro and nanoscale systems in the weak-memory regime: A mathematical framework beyond the Markov approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visible dynamics of small-scale systems are strongly affected by unobservable degrees of freedom, which can belong either to external environments or internal subsystems and almost inevitably induce memory effects. Formally, such inaccessible degrees of freedom can be systematically eliminated from essentially any microscopic model through projection operator techniques, which result in non-local time evolution equations. This article investigates how and under what conditions locality in time can be rigorously restored beyond the standard Markov approximation, which generally requires the characteristic time scales of accessible and inaccessible degrees of freedom to be sharply separated. Specifically, we consider non-local time evolution equations that are autonomous and linear in the variables of interest. For this class of models, we prove a mathematical theorem that establishes a well-defined weak-memory regime, where faithful local approximations exists, even if the relevant time scales are of comparable order of magnitude. The generators of these local approximations, which become exact in the long-time limit, are time independent and can be determined to arbitrary accuracy through a convergent perturbation theory in the memory strength, where the Markov generator is recovered in first order. For illustration, we work out three simple, yet instructive, examples covering coarse grained Markov jump networks, semi-Markov jump processes and generalized Langevin equations.</description>

      <title>The mean field approximation for a system of triplet bosons in nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth orthonickelates RNiO3 are Jahn-Teller magnets, unstable with respect to the anti-Jahn-Teller disproportionation reaction with the formation of a system equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a non-magnetic lattice. Within the framework of the two-sublattice approximation, we have developed a mean field theory for a model nickelate with competition between phases of charge ordering, an antiferromagnetic insulator and a spin-triplet superconductor, and constructed phase diagrams taking into account phase separation.</description>

      <title>Correction-to-scaling exponent for percolation and the Fortuin--Kasteleyn Potts model in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number $n_s$ of clusters (per site) of size $s$, a central quantity in percolation theory, displays at criticality an algebraic scaling behavior of the form $n_s\simeq s^{-\tau}\, A\, (1+B s^{-\Omega})$. For the Fortuin--Kasteleyn representation of the $Q$-state Potts model in two dimensions, the Fisher exponent $\tau$ is known as a function of the real parameter $0\le Q\le4$, and, for bond percolation (the $Q\rightarrow 1$ limit), the correction-to-scaling exponent is derived as $\Omega=72/91$. We theoretically derive the exact formula for the correction-to-scaling exponent $\Omega=8/[(2g+1)(2g+3)]$ as a function of the Coulomb-gas coupling strength $g$, which is related to $Q$ by $Q=2+2\cos(2 \pi g)$. Using an efficient Monte Carlo cluster algorithm, we study the O($n$) loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is in the same universality class as the $Q=n^2$ Potts model, and has significantly suppressed finite-size corrections and critical slowing-down. The predictions of the above formula include the exact value for percolation as a special case, and agree well with the numerical estimates of $\Omega$ for both the critical and tricritical branches of the Potts model.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium universality of the nonreciprocally coupled $\mathbf{O(n_1) \times O(n_2)}$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an important class of nonequilibrium dynamics in the form of nonreciprocal interactions. In particular, we study how nonreciprocal coupling between two $O(n_i)$ order parameters (with $i=1,2$) affects the universality at a multicritical point, extending the analysis of [J.T. Young et al., Phys. Rev. X 10, 011039 (2020)], which considered the case $n_1 = n_2 = 1$, i.e., a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ model. We show that nonequilibrium fixed points (NEFPs) emerge for a broad range of $n_1,n_2$ and exhibit intrinsically nonequilibrium critical phenomena, namely a violation of fluctuation-dissipation relations at all scales and underdamped oscillations near criticality in contrast to the overdamped relaxational dynamics of the corresponding equilibrium models. Furthermore, the NEFPs exhibit an emergent discrete scale invariance in certain physically-relevant regimes of $n_1,n_2$, but not others, depending on whether the critical exponent $\nu$ is real or complex. The boundary between these two regions is described by an exceptional point in the renormalization group (RG) flow, leading to distinctive features in correlation functions and the phase diagram. Another contrast with the previous work is the number and stability of the NEFPs as well as the underlying topology of the RG flow. Finally, we investigate an extreme form of nonreciprocity where one order parameter is independent of the other order parameter but not vice versa. Unlike the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ model, which becomes non-perturbative in this case, we identify a distinct nonequilibrium universality class whose dependent field similarly violates fluctuation-dissipation relations but does not exhibit discrete scale invariance or underdamped oscillations near criticality.</description>

      <title>Learning complexity gradually in quantum machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is an emergent field that continues to draw significant interest for its potential to offer improvements over classical algorithms in certain areas. However, training quantum models remains a challenging task, largely because of the difficulty in establishing an effective inductive bias when solving high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a training framework that prioritizes informative data points over the entire training set. This approach draws inspiration from classical techniques such as curriculum learning and hard example mining to introduce an additional inductive bias through the training data itself. By selectively focusing on informative samples, we aim to steer the optimization process toward more favorable regions of the parameter space. This data-centric approach complements existing strategies such as warm-start initialization methods, providing an additional pathway to address performance challenges in quantum machine learning. We provide theoretical insights into the benefits of prioritizing informative data for quantum models, and we validate our methodology with numerical experiments on selected recognition tasks of quantum phases of matter. Our findings indicate that this strategy could be a valuable approach for improving the performance of quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Exact physical quantities of the XYZ spin chain in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic limits of the XYZ spin chain with periodic or twisted boundary conditions are studied. By using the technique of characterizing the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix by the $T-Q$ relation and by the zeros of the associated polynomial, we obtain the constraints of the Bethe roots and the zeros for the eigenvalues. With the help of structure of Bethe roots, we obtain the distribution patterns of zeros. Based on them, the physical quantities such as the surface energy and excitation energy are calculated. We find that both of them depend on the parity of sites number due to the topological long-range Neel order on the Mobius manifold in the spin space. We also check our results with those obtaining by the density matrix renormalization group. The method provided in this paper can be applied to study the thermodynamic properties at the thermal equilibrium state with finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Transport of molecules via polymerization in chemical gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of molecules for chemical reactions is critically important in various cellular biological processes. Despite thermal diffusion being prevalent in many biochemical processes, it is unreliable for any sort of directed transport or preferential accumulation of molecules. In this paper we propose a strategy for directed motion in which the molecules are transported by active carriers via polymerization. This transport is facilitated by chemical/activity gradients which generate an effective drift of the polymers. By marginalizing out the active degrees of freedom of the system, we obtain an effective Fokker-Planck equation for the Rouse modes of such active-passive hybrid polymers. In particular, we solve for the steady state distribution of the center of mass and its mean first passage time to reach an intended destination. We focus on how the arrangement of active units within the polymer affect its steady-state and dynamic behaviour and how they can be optimized to achieve high accumulation or rapid motility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate and validate a generalization of the renowned transition-path-sampling algorithm for a paradigmatic model of active particles, namely the Run-and-Tumble particles. Notwithstanding the non-equilibrium character of these particles, we show how the consequent lack of the microscopical reversibility property, which is usually required by transition-path sampling, can be circumvented by identifying reasonable backward dynamics with a well-defined path-probability density. Our method is then applied to characterize the structure and kinetics of rare transition pathways undergone by Run-and-Tumble particles having to cross a potential barrier in order to find a target.</description>

      <title>Volume-law entanglement fragmentation of quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy in quasiparticle states where certain unit patterns are excited repeatedly and sequentially in momentum space. We find that in the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement, leading to a volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. This characteristic of volume-law entanglement fragmentation is numerically confirmed in both fermionic and bosonic chains. We derive an analytical formula for fermions, which can also be applied to the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with appropriate identifications.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum systems is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics in a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of phagocytosis through interplay of forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phagocytosis is the process by which cells, which are 5 to 10 times larger than the particle size, engulf particles, holding substantial importance in various biological contexts ranging from the nutrient uptake of unicellular organisms to immune system of humans, animals etc. While the previous studies focused primarily on the mechanism of phagocytosis, in this study we have a taken a different route by studying the dynamics of the phagocytes in a system consisting of many bacteria and a small number of phagocytes. We put forward a minimalist framework that models bacteria and phagocytes as active and passive circular disks, respectively. The interactions are governed by directional forces: phagocytes are attracted toward bacteria, while bacteria experience a repulsive force in proximity to phagocytes. Bacteria are capable of reproduction at a fixed rate, and the balance between bacterial reproduction and phagocytic engulfment is governed by the interplay of the two opposing forces. In attraction dominated regimes, bacterial populations decrease rapidly, while in repulsion dominated regimes, bacterial clusters grow and impede phagocytes, often resulting in phagocyte trapping. Conversely, in attraction-dominated scenarios, only a few bacteria remain at later times, rendering the motion of the phagocytes diffusive. Further, the transition between the two regimes occurs through a regime of bi-stability. Our study further describes the dynamics of both species using the tools of statistical analysis, offering insights into the internal dynamics of this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that in the Gaussian approximation, the contribution of ionic fluctuations is separate from the contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", which was previously used on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to other researchers based on the Lifshitz theory.</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum state with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the variationally optimized disentangler corresponds to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, e.g., the Kramer-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of CAMPS as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Theory of Quantum-Classical Systems at Finite Temperature, Part I: Exact Functional Formulation in the Canonical Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on approximations that introduce ambiguities. This series of papers aims to establish a rigorous theoretical framework to guide the development of a QM/cDFT formulation that clarifies the approximations involved. In this first paper, we establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum (QM)-classical (MM) systems within the canonical ensemble. We derive the equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm QM and N mm MM particles and, based on this derivation, propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM-MM density matrix. By leveraging permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the variational problem using functionals of objects having reduced dimensionalities. Three different formulations are presented, each using quantities with progressively lower dimensionalities. This ultimately enables computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the QM and MM one-body densities, generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM-MM systems. In a subsequent paper, this formalism will be extended to the grand canonical ensemble, allowing classical particle number fluctuations. This extension, in which cDFT is most naturally formulated, provides a framework for studying solvation problems.</description>

This includes the classical hard rod elastic collisions, when rod lengths are constant and equal to a positive value. We prove that in the diffusive space-time scaling, an initial fluctuation of density of particles of velocity $v$, after recentering on its Euler evolution, evolve randomly shifted by a Brownian motion of variance $\mathcal D(v)$.</description>

      <title>Sensing atomic superfluid rotation beyond the standard quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic superfluids formed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a ring trap are currently being investigated in the context of superfluid hydrodynamics, quantum sensing and matter-wave interferometry. The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit. Our proposal is relevant to atomtronics, quantum sensing and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: In slowly driven classical systems, work is a stochastic quantity and its probability distribution is known to satisfy the work fluctuation-dissipation relation, which states that the mean and variance of the dissipated work are linearly related. Recently, it was shown that generation of quantum coherence in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis leads to a correction to this linear relation in the slow-driving regime. Here, we go even further by investigating nonclassical features of work fluctuations in setups with more than one system. To do this, we first generalize slow control protocols to encompass multipartite systems, allowing for the generation of quantum correlations during the driving process. Then, focussing on two-qubit systems, we show that entanglement generation leads to a positive contribution to the dissipated work, which is distinct from the quantum correction due to local coherence generation known from previous work. Our results show that entanglement generated during slow control protocols, e.g. as an unavoidable consequence of qubit crosstalk, comes at the cost of increased dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercriticality, characterized by strong fluctuations and a wealth of phenomena, emerges as an intriguing state beyond the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the quantum Ising model and Rydberg atom array through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We find two supercritical crossover lines in the quantum phase diagram with universal scaling, $h \propto (g - g_c)^{\beta + \gamma}$, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\beta, \gamma$ are the related critical exponents. Enclosed by the two crossover lines, there exist supercritical quantum states with universal behaviors in correlations and entanglement. In particular, we reveal a dynamical quantum phase transition occurring when traversing the quantum supercritical crossover line. These dynamical singularities, attributed to the intersection of Lee-Yang-Fisher zero lines with the real-time axis, have no counterpart in classical supercriticality. We propose that the Rydberg atom array offers an ideal platform for studying the quantum supercritical crossovers and measuring the critical exponents. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality and related phenomena in correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling power-grid systems has got a major importance in present days as transformation to renewable energy sources requires the complete re-design of energy transmission. Renewable energy sources can be located quite far from their consumption points because urban and industrial structures do not follow physical constraints and capabilities. Important examples are the sea coast vs inland divisions in the case of wind power. Ill-constructed high-voltage (HV) power grids can cause catastrophic damages to economies as it was demonstrated in recent history via the emergence of large blackout events. The probability distributions of such events was found to be fat-tailed, exhibiting power-law (PL) tails very often. To understand them, self-organized critical direct current (DC) models have been constructed~\cite{car2} and have been shown to describe well the PL exponents of empirical values. However, many details could not be understood as power-grids work with alternating currents (AC) in which phase differences are the primary causes of the power-flows.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to T. Tanaka and Y. Nakayama, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalisation of the thermal entropy to complex inverse temperatures, which we call the thermal pseudo-entropy. We show that this quantity represents the pseudo-entropy of the transition matrix between Thermofield Double states at different times. We have studied its properties in various quantum mechanical setups, Schwarzian theory, Random Matrix Theories, and 2D CFTs, including symmetric orbifolds. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the averaged thermal pseudo-entropy and the spectral form factor, which is instrumental in distinguishing chaotic and integrable models. Moreover, we have observed a logarithmic scaling of this quantity in models with a continuous spectrum, with a universal coefficient that is sensitive to the scaling of the density of states near the edge of the spectrum. Lastly, we found the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the thermal pseudo-entropy through the Kramers-Kronig relations.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties pose significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained on extensive many-body polarization (MB-pol) reference data approaching coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>

Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Sondheimer oscillations of conductivity in thin cadmium crystals</title>

Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.</description>
