      <title>Decoding cell signaling via optimal transport and information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in cellular signal processing is understanding how biochemical networks perform reliably despite molecular noise. Traditionally, mutual information has been widely used to quantify signaling fidelity, capturing how well outputs discriminate distinct input states. However, it fails to capture whether the output also faithfully mirrors the statistical structure of the input, a property crucial in processes like morphogen patterning, dose-dependent signaling, and cellular communication. To address this gap, we introduce the 2-Wasserstein distance from optimal transport theory, which provides a geometric basis for comparing input and output distributions. In our proposed framework, we define mutual information as informational fidelity and the inverse of the 2-Wasserstein distance as geometric fidelity. Applying this dual-fidelity framework to canonical regulatory motifs under Gaussian channel approximation reveals a topology-dependent trade-off: coherent feed-forward loops can achieve high performance in both dimensions, whereas feedback architectures typically sacrifice informational fidelity to enhance geometric fidelity. We demonstrate that theoretical predictions of feedback regulation are well supported by experimental data from tumor necrosis factor signaling. Our results demonstrate that maximizing information alone is not always advantageous and that reliable signaling arises from balancing information transmission with the geometric aspects of signaling. Thus, our analysis establishes geometric fidelity as a fundamental, yet previously unrecognized, dimension of signaling fidelity. It also provides a quantitative, experimentally accessible framework for dissecting natural networks and designing task-specific synthetic circuits.</description>

      <title>UBio-MolFM: A Universal Molecular Foundation Model for Bio-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulation serves as a quintessential ``computational microscope'' for understanding the machinery of life, yet it remains fundamentally limited by the trade-off between quantum-mechanical (QM) accuracy and biological scale. We present UBio-MolFM, a universal foundation model framework specifically engineered to bridge this gap. UBio-MolFM introduces three synergistic innovations: (1) UBio-Mol26, a large bio-specific dataset constructed via a multi-fidelity ``Two-Pronged Strategy'' that combines systematic bottom-up enumeration with top-down sampling of native protein environments (up to 1,200 atoms); (2) E2Former-V2, a linear-scaling equivariant transformer that integrates Equivariant Axis-Aligned Sparsification (EAAS) and Long-Short Range (LSR) modeling to capture non-local physics with up to ~4x higher inference throughput in our large-system benchmarks; and (3) a Three-Stage Curriculum Learning protocol that transitions from energy initialization to energy-force consistency, with force-focused supervision to mitigate energy offsets. Rigorous benchmarking across microscopic forces and macroscopic observables -- including liquid water structure, ionic solvation, and peptide folding -- demonstrates that UBio-MolFM achieves ab initio-level fidelity on large, out-of-distribution biomolecular systems (up to ~1,500 atoms) and realistic MD observables. By reconciling scalability with quantum precision, UBio-MolFM provides a robust, ready-to-use tool for the next generation of computational biology.</description>

      <title>Scaling and tuning to criticality in resting-state human magnetoencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws in biological neural networks have long been investigated. From 1/f noise to neuronal avalanches, evidence of scaling in brain activity has been increasingly linked to tuning to or near criticality. The concept of scaling is intimately related to the renormalization group (RG), in essence providing coarse-grained, simplified descriptions that generalize to classes of diverse physical systems. Following the RG idea, a coarse-graining scheme has recently been proposed for populations of real neurons, and scaling behaviors in collective quantities have been reported in the hippocampus and in different areas of the rat cortex. To bridge the gap between neuronal population scales and species, here we consider large-scale, electrophysiological recordings of human brain activity in the awake resting-state. We demonstrate robust scaling behaviors of collective dynamics across coarse-graining scales, with exponents close to those measured in populations of spiking neurons. Further, we show that dynamics of neuronal avalanches, scale-free cascades of neural activity, are invariant under the proposed coarse-graining approach. Simulations of a non-equilibrium adaptive Ising model inferred from data and apt to reproduce a large repertoire of resting-state brain dynamics indicate that the scaling behaviors of the resting human brain activity emerge close to criticality and depend on the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance of the network. While extending the range of validity of previous observations at small spatial scales and pointing to common scaling laws in mammals, the results open the way to a robust (currently missing) non-invasive approach to estimate the E/I balance, a key quantity in neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>Emergence of generic first-passage time distributions for large Markovian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-passage times are often the most relevant aspect of a complex Markovian network, because they signify when information processing has resulted in a definite decision. Previous studies have shown that for kinetic proofreading networks in the limit of large network size the first-passage time distribution converges either to a delta or to an exponential distribution. Remarkably, these two forms correspond to the two extreme distributions of minimal and maximal entropy for a fixed mean, respectively. Here we build on the connection between first-passage times and graph theory to show that these two limits are not model-specific, but arise generically in Markovian networks from the distribution of the eigenvalues of the generator matrix. A deterministic peak emerges when infinitely many eigenvalues contribute, while the exponential limit arises from a single dominant eigenvalue. We also show that the exponential limit emerges robustly for reversible networks when a backward bias exists. In contrast, the deterministic limit is not obtained from a simple reversal of this condition, but under structurally tighter conditions, revealing a fundamental asymmetry between both regimes. Our theoretical analysis is illustrated and validated by computer simulations of one-step master equations and random networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Wound Closure in Living Nematic Epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically the closure of a wound in a layer of epithelial cells in a living tissue after damage. Our analysis is informed by our recent experiments observing re-epithelialisation in vivo of Drosophila pupae. On time and length-scales such that the evolution of the epithelial tissue near the wound is well captured by that of a 2D active fluid with local nematic order, we consider the free-surface problem of a hole in a bounded region of tissue, and study the role that active stresses far from the hole play in the closure of the hole. For parallel anchored nematic order at the wound boundary (as we observe in our experiments), we find that closure is accelerated when the active stresses are contractile and slowed down when the stresses are extensile. Parallel anchoring also leads to the appearance of topological defects which annihilate upon wound closure.</description>

      <title>An Entropy-initiated Coupled-Trait ODE Framework for Modeling Longitudinal Cohort Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a minimal, information-theoretic dynamical framework for modeling longitudinal cohort data using an entropy-initiated system of coupled-trait ordinary differential equations (ECTO). For each survey wave, item-level Likert responses are compressed into a normalized Shannon entropy index that summarizes cross-sectional dispersion; this index is used to initialize the low-dimensional state variables of the autonomous ODE system. ECTO then tracks the interactions among a primary trait-like state, a secondary coupled state, and a latent environmental-stress component through phenomenological terms representing generic self-limitation, trade-offs, and feedback. Using data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (SATSA), the framework reproduces broad cohort-level trajectories and is evaluated with leave-one-wave-out forecasting and comparisons against simple statistical baselines. A second longitudinal dataset of U.S. dental student data provides an external validation test, demonstrating that low-dimensional dynamics initialized from entropy measures can generalize across cohorts with different measurement instruments, demographic compositions, and timescales. Across both datasets, ECTO achieves stable out-of-sample performance, indicating that major cohort-level trends can be captured without assuming complex latent-variable models or time-varying causal inputs. Entropy here functions as a compact summary of population heterogeneity rather than a dynamical driver, and the coupled ODEs supply an interpretable alternative to high-dimensional or black box machine-learning approaches. This framework establishes a concise, transparent method for linking information-theoretic preprocessing with cohort-level dynamical modeling and provides a foundation for future multivariate or multi-cohort extensions.</description>
