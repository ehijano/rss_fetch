      <title>Diffeomorphisms of the energy-momentum space: perturbative QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perturbative formulation of quantum electrodynamics is given in terms of geometrical invariants of the energy-momentum space, whose geometry is taken to be one of a constant curvature. The construction is relevant for different classes of noncomutativity: the Snyder model and the so called GUP models. For the Snyder model it is shown that all the amplitudes are finite at every order of the perturbation expansion.</description>

      <title>The Last Loophole in Bell's Theorem? A prima facie problem with superdeterminism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hance and Hossenfelder recently claim that the extensive experimental confirmations of Bell's Theorem do not in fact demonstrate that nature is nonlocal, but merely that nature can be local only if the distant detector settings in a Bell-EPR setup are not statistically independent. They suggest that such interdependence could take a local-deterministic form. There is no question that in general quantum mechanics not only allows but demands that the distant detectors be entangled and thus correlated, even though it is possible to do experiments in which such correlations can be ignored. The real question is whether entanglement itself could have a deterministic explanation. We review why any such attempted deterministic underpinning for quantum statistics would run into immediate conflict with quantum indeterminacy and the noncommutativity upon which the latter is based. Some cosmological implications are briefly explored.</description>

      <title>Holographic superfluid sound modes with bulk acoustic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sound modes of a flowing superfluid is described by the massless Klein-Gordon equation in an effective background metric. This effective background metric can be designed to mimick a black hole using the acoustic horizon. In this work, we study the AdS/CFT dual of the sound modes in the presence of an acoustic horizon in the bulk. Focusing on fluids with a purely radial flow, we derive the metric tensor for the effective acoustic spacetime and deduce a necessary condition for an acoustic black hole geometry to exist within the fluid. Using specific examples of superfluid velocity profiles, we obtained the source, operator expectation value, Green's function, and spectral density of the dual field theory by solving for the asymptotic behavior of the sound modes near the AdS boundary. In all our examples, the sound modes remain gapless but the excitations are described by branch cuts, instead of poles, which is typical of strongly coupled systems. Furthermore, we calculate the effective Hawking temperature of the dual field theory associated with the bulk acoustic horizon. Lastly, we investigate the near horizon properties and derive the superfluid velocity profile that can give rise to an infrared emergent quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Topological and Geometric Properties of Spherically Symmetric Black Hole Metrics: Connections to Bose-Einstein Condensation and Uniqueness in Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interplay between the geometric and topological properties of spherically symmetric black hole metrics within Einstein gravity, emphasizing implications for Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC). By analyzing metric functions, scalar fields, and the cosmological constant, we reveal how these black hole solutions are intrinsically linked to the underlying spacetime topology. We establish the uniqueness of a general black hole solution that supports BEC and demonstrate the impossibility of BEC in Kerr black holes. Additionally, through Laurent series expansions, residue calculations, winding numbers, and contour integrals, we confirm the algebraic and dimensional consistency between double Kerr black hole collisions and specific scalar field black hole solutions. This work uncovers fundamental connections in black hole interactions, providing a robust mathematical framework for understanding the dynamics of complex black hole systems and their interactions with scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Black Hole Solutions from f(R) Gravity and Their Canonical Ensemble Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum-corrected black hole solutions derived from f(R) gravity and explores their thermodynamic properties using the canonical ensemble framework. By incorporating higher-order f(R) corrections into classical black hole metrics, we construct regular black hole solutions that eliminate classical singularities. Advanced canonical ensemble techniques, including path integral formulations and stability analyses, are employed to examine the thermodynamic stability, phase transitions, and critical phenomena of these f(R)-corrected black holes. The results indicate that f(R) corrections significantly alter the thermodynamic landscape, introducing novel phase structures and stability conditions. Additionally, numerical simulations are conducted to visualize the behavior of thermodynamic quantities under varying f(R) correction parameters. This work provides deeper insights into the interplay between modified gravity effects and black hole thermodynamics, contributing to the broader understanding of gravitational phenomena in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>On the existence of quaternion-handedness for the spinor solutions of the Dirac and Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of quaternionic left and right-handed algebraic frameworks to discuss the neutrino-handedness behavior. The generalized left and right-handed Dirac equations are expressed in terms of quaternionic four-dimensional non-commutative algebra, which yields helicity eigenspinors with definite spin states for Dirac neutrino eigenstates. We establish the spinor states of energy and momentum solutions for Dirac neutrinos and antineutrinos revealed by the non-commutative nature of quaternionic algebra. Furthermore, we expand the quaternionic Dirac spinor solutions to Majorana-like spinor solutions, which represent the mass eigenstates for Majorana neutrinos. By examining two-flavor neutrino oscillation, we express the quaternionic energy and momentum eigenstates of Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, as well as their oscillation probabilities. The estimated quaternionic-based probability supports neutrinos' massive nature and the presence of their right chiral components. The current quaternionic theory has the benefit of identifying the distinct properties of left and right-handed neutrinos, as well as anti-neutrinos, within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Novel inverse multi-objective optimization-empowered design of microperforated panels for enhanced low-frequency noise mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microperforated panels (MPPs) display excellent capacity in noise control applications owing to their high strength, simple design, and efficacy in low-frequency sound absorption. Traditionally, the development of MPPs has relied on a trial-and-error design approach. Although simple optimization-based methods have recently begun to be employed, these designs often overlook practical considerations, such as the increased costs associated with adding more MPP layers, which presents a gap to achieve the practical feasibility of MPP deployment. To address this, the study aims to develop an inverse multi-objective optimization-empowered framework for MPP design to enhance low-frequency noise mitigation while minimizing fabrication costs. Specifically, a finite element (FE) model is established to conduct the acoustic analysis of MPPs, followed by thorough experimental validation. A novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) is then developed to cope with mixed-type design variables with interrelations inherent to the MPP architecture. Using the high-fidelity FE model as a cornerstone, the MOPSO guides the inverse optimization analysis to yield multiple non-dominant solutions. These solutions not only avoid the trap of local optima, but also allow for continuous screening to ensure the engineering viability based on empirical judgment. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The MPPs designed in this study show great potential for mitigating indoor noise in buildings, addressing noise issues arising from rapid urbanization and transportation development. Furthermore, the novel optimization strategy proposed in this study holds wide applicability for other sound absorption materials.</description>

      <title>Trajectory equations of a non-conservative natural system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the article is to derive equations that determine the trajectory of a non-conservative natural system in configuration space in non-stationary external fields. A theorem on the change in the kinetic energy of the system is preliminarily proved. Lagrange equations are used to derive the equations. The derived equations can be solved numerically by the Runge-Kutta method of the 4th order. The trajectory equations together with the equality describing its parameterization form the trajectorial method for solving dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing arrays within rotating and expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the four pulsar timing arrays were interpreted as a signal of the low frequency stochastic gravitational wave background. We show that the amplitude and angular correlations of pulsar timing residuals can be interpreted as a consequence of the vortical geodetic motions of pulsar's photons within rotating and expanding Universe. The resulting angular correlation curves are similar to the Hellings-Downs curve and the observed amplitude allows the estimate of the vorticity of the Universe. Therefore, no gravitational wave background is necessary to elucidate the pulsar timing data.</description>

      <title>Causality in the maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime with identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) spacetime with $e^2 &lt; m^2$ can be interpreted either as an infinite chain of asymptotically flat regions connected by tunnels between timelike singularities or as a set of just one pair of asymptotically flat regions and one tunnel; the repetitions of this set in the infinite chain being identified. The second interpretation gives rise to the suspicion of acausality, i.e. the possibility of sending messages to one's own past. A numerical investigation of this problem was carried out in this paper and gave the following result. Let E be the initial point of a radial timelike future-directed ingoing geodesic G, lying halfway between the outer horizon and the image of the null infinity in the maximally extended RN spacetime. Let E$'$ be the first future copy of E. It was verified whether the turning point of G lies outside or inside the past light cone (PLC) of E$'$. In the second case the breach of causality does occur. It turned out that the acausality is present when $V_E$, the timelike coordinate of E, is negative with a sufficiently large $|V_E|$, and is absent with a sufficiently large $V_E &gt; 0$. In between these values there exists a $\widetilde{V}_E$, dependent on the initial data for the geodesic, for which the turning point lies on the PLC. So, the identification does lead to acausality. Nonradial timelike and null geodesics were also investigated, and a few hitherto unknown properties of the maximal extension were revealed. For example, the singularity arc at $r = 0$ may be convex or concave, depending on the values of $m$ and $e$.</description>
