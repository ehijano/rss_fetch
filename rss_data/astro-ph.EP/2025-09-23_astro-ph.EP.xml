      <title>Identifying close-in Jupiters that arrived via disk migration: Evidence of primordial alignment, preference of nearby companions and hint of runaway migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two leading hypotheses for hot Jupiter migration are disk migration and high-eccentricity migration (HEM). Stellar obliquity is commonly used to distinguish them, as high obliquity often accompanies HEM. However, low obliquity does not guarantee disk migration, due to possible spin-orbit realignment or coplanar HEM. Seeking a proxy for disk migration, we investigate the idea that when the circularization timescale of a planet on circular orbit is longer than its age ($\tau_\mathrm{cir} &gt; \tau_\mathrm{age}$), HEM would not have had sufficient time to complete, favoring disk migration. We empirically calibrate the reduced planetary tidal quality factor to be $Q_\mathrm{p}=4.9^{+3.5}_{-2.5}\times10^5$ using the eccentricity distribution of 500+ Jovian mass ($0.2M_\mathrm{J}&lt;M_\mathrm{p}&lt;13M_\mathrm{J}$) planets with measured masses and radii, a value consistent with solar system Jupiter. We then calculate $\tau_\mathrm{cir}$ and identify dozens of disk migration candidates ($\tau_\mathrm{cir} &gt; \tau_\mathrm{age}, \ e &lt; 0.1$). These planets show three notable trends. We first find a clear cutoff of obliquity at $\tau_\mathrm{cir} \sim \tau_\mathrm{age}$, suggesting the primordial alignment of protoplanetary disks. Secondly, we find that among hot Jupiters ($a&lt;0.1$ au), nearby companions are preferentially found around disk migration candidates, suggesting that either HEM dominates hot Jupiter formation, or disk migration also disrupts nearby companions at short separations. Finally, we find a possible dearth of disk migration candidates around mass ratio $\log q \sim -3.2$, consistent with a similar dip suggested at longer orbits from microlensing. The lack of planets across different orbital distance, if true, could be interpreted as a hint of runaway migration.</description>

      <title>Polarized Signatures of Variable Worlds: Modeling Heterogeneous Habitable Earth- and Early Mars-like (Exo)planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets is a complex problem that represents the next major step for the astrophysical community. The majority of current models treat these planets as homogeneous or contain heterogeneity that is constant in time. In reality, habitable exoplanets are expected to contain atmospheric and surface heterogeneities similar to Earth, with diurnal rotation, seasonal changes, and weather patterns resulting in complex, time-dependent signatures. Due to its ability to measure light as a vector, polarimetry provides an important tool that will enhance the characterizations of heterogeneous worlds. Here we model the visible to near-infrared linear spectropolarimetric signatures, as functions of wavelength and planetary phase angle, of various heterogeneous Earth scenarios as well as the first signals of an early wet and potentially habitable Mars. The contributions from the different atmospheric and surface properties result in asymmetric phase curves and variable spectra, with the polarization appearing to be more sensitive than flux to heterogeneities such as patchy clouds and continents moving into and out-of-view. Our models provide important predictions of expected polarized and unpolarized signatures of heterogeneous exoplanets that will help guide the designs and observing plans of future polarimeters, including those proposed for the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the magnetic field of hot Jupiters within the geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical and experimental foundations of the hypothesis about the origin of the magnetic fields of the Earth and other astrophysical objects, proposed in the early 20th century by W. Sutherland, A. Einstein, and independently by Yu.S. Vladimirov, are discussed in the paper. According to this hypothesis, the electric charges of the electron and proton slightly differ in magnitude, leading to the emergence of a magnetic field in rotating astrophysical objects. The theoretical justification of the Sutherland-Einstein hypothesis is presented in a simplified version of the 6D Kaluza-Klein theory, taking into account the consequences of the Kerr-Newman metric. The analysis shows that a fundamental dipole-type magnetic field should arise around any massive rotating body. However, in real astrophysical objects, such a field is largely screened and distorted by induced charges and currents. As an application, we consider the problem of determining the magnetic fields of hot Jupiters, since the strong tidal effects in these giant exoplanets should result in approximately similar screening mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging for the Debris Disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the inner debris disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani using simulated observations with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C). Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we generate synthetic scattered-light images and spectral energy distributions for three disk models that differ in inclination and radial extent, and compare these results with the anticipated performance of CPI-C. CPI-C can resolve disk structures down to $\sim$3 au, offering substantially finer spatial resolution than existing HST/STIS and Spitzer/IRS observations. Recovered inclinations and radial extents closely match the input models, constraining the disk geometry and informing potential planet-disk interactions in the $\epsilon$ Eri system. Although the cold Jupiter-like planet $\epsilon$ Eri b is not detected in our simulations, polarimetric methods may enable detection of its reflected light. These results highlight the capability of next-generation coronagraphs to probe cold dust in nearby planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Zonal winds in Titan's middle atmosphere from a stellar occultation observed with Keck adaptive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved Keck/NIRC2 images of a stellar occultation by Titan on September 5, 2022 and compare them to predictions from concurrent ALMA observations and a suite of General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations. ALMA data and GCM simulations can predict middle atmosphere zonal wind distributions, which in turn produce diagnostic occultation image sequences. We construct an occultation forward model using the temperature profile measured by the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument, which is then distorted using latitudinal zonal wind profiles from the ALMA data or GCM simulations. The occultation forward model yields simulated light distributions around Titan's limb, which we compare directly to the light distributions observed during the occultation. The GCM zonal wind profile corresponding to slightly before the time of the stellar occultation provides the best overall match to the data. The ALMA wind profile provides the best match to the occultation data when only the ingress data were considered, but is not the best match when data from ingress and egress are combined. Our data support the presence of stronger winds in the southern hemisphere during late northern summer.</description>

      <title>An Initial Assessment of the Hanle Echelle Spectrograph for Exoplanet Atmosphere Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is an effective technique for probing exoplanetary atmospheres. While most observations have relied on space facilities such as HST and JWST, ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy (HRTS) has also provided valuable insights by resolving individual atomic features. In this work, we present an initial performance assessment and feasibility test of the Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) on the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) for HRTS. As a benchmark, we observed the hot Jupiter HD 209458b during a single transit at a resolution of R = 30,000. We developed a Python-based, semi-automated data reduction and analysis pipeline that includes corrections for telluric contamination and stellar radial velocity shifts. The final achieved signal-to-noise ratio and spectral stability allow us to probe for features at the 0.1% level. This work establishes a methodology and demonstrates the operational capability of the HESP-HCT for obtaining high-resolution transmission spectra.</description>

      <title>Radial Velocity Strategies for the Orbital Refinement of Exoplanet Direct Imaging Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many potential direct imaging candidates suffer from large orbital period uncertainties, leading to challenges in accurate predictions of future orbital positions and imprecise direct imaging measurements of planetary parameters. To improve the precision in orbital properties, precursor radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations for selected candidates are essential. This study examines the impact of three variables on the orbital period uncertainties of long-period giant planets: the number of future observations, the temporal gap between past and future data, and the temporal coverage of upcoming observations. Our simulations indicate that the orbital phases at which future RV observations are acquired play a significant role in reducing period uncertainties. Additionally, observing too frequently within a given time frame adds limited value to the program once a certain number of observations has been achieved. The temporal gap proves to be the most important factor when there is no strict end time to the observing campaign. However, if a strict end time is set, starting observations earlier yields improved reductions in orbital period uncertainty. These insights offer practical guidance for planning efficient RV follow-up campaigns to maximize the science yield of future space-based direct imaging missions.</description>

      <title>A Thick Volatile Atmosphere on the Ultra-Hot Super-Earth TOI-561 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-short period (USP) exoplanets -- with $R_p \leq 2~$R$_{\oplus}$ and periods $\leq$1 day -- are expected to be stripped of volatile atmospheres by intense host star irradiation, which is corroborated by their nominal bulk densities and previous eclipse observations consistent with bare rock surfaces. However, a few USP planets appear anomalously under-dense relative to an Earth-like composition, suggesting an exotic interior structure (e.g., core-less) or a volatile-rich secondary atmosphere increasing their apparent radius. Here we present the first dayside emission spectrum of the low density (4.3$\pm$0.4 g~cm$^{-3}$) ultra-short period planet TOI-561 b, which orbits an iron-poor, alpha-rich, $\sim$10 Gyr old thick disk star. Our 3-5 $\mu$m JWST/NIRSpec observations demonstrate the dayside of TOI-561 b is inconsistent with a bare-rock surface at high statistical significance, suggesting instead a thick volatile envelope that is cooling the dayside to well below the $\sim$3000 K expected in the bare rock or thin atmosphere case. These results reject the popular hypothesis of complete atmospheric desiccation for highly irradiated exoplanets and support predictions that planetary-scale magma oceans can retain substantial reservoirs of volatiles, opening the geophysical study of ultra-hot super-Earths through the lens of their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Probing dust and grain growth in the optically thick circumbinary ring of V892 Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A considerable proportion of young stars belong to multiple star systems. Constraining the planet formation processes in multiple stellar systems is then key to understand the global exoplanet population. This study focuses on investigating the dust reservoir within the triple system V892 Tau. Our objective is to establish constraints on the properties and characteristics of the dust present in the system's circumbinary ring. Based on archival ALMA and VLA data from 0.9 mm to 9.8 mm, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the ring of V892 Tau. We first studied the spatial variation of the spectral index, before employing 3D full radiative transfer calculations to constrain the ring's geometry and the radial dependence of the dust grain properties. Spectral indices are consistent with non-dust emission in the vicinity of the central binary, and with dust emission in the ring likely remaining optically thick up to 3.0 mm. Our radiative transfer analysis supports these interpretations, yielding a model that reproduces the observed intensities within the 1-sigma uncertainties across all wavelengths. The resulting dust surface density and temperature profiles both decrease with increasing radius, and are in agreement with values reported in the literature. Maximum grain sizes are constrained to 0.2 cm, with a size distribution power-law index -3.5. These results imply that the dust grain fragmentation velocity does not exceed 8 m/s. Whilst our results suggest dust trapping at the cavity edge, they also suggest that tidal perturbations triggered by the central binary limit grain growth within the ring. This highlights the need to further constrain planet formation efficiency in multiple stellar systems, a goal that may be advanced by applying the methodology of this work to a wider sample of systems.</description>

      <title>An ancient L- type family associated to (460) Scania in the Middle Main Belt as revealed by Gaia DR3 spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid families are typically identified using hierarchical clustering methods (HCM) in the proper element phase space. However, these methods struggle with overlapping families, interlopers, and the detection of older structures. Spectroscopic data can help overcome these limitations. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains reflectance spectra at visible wavelengths for 60,518 asteroids over the range between 374-1034 nm, representing a large sample that is well suited to studies of asteroid families. Using Gaia spectroscopic data, we investigate a region in the central Main Belt centered around 2.72 AU, known for its connection to L- type asteroids. Conflicting family memberships reported by different HCM implementations underscore the need for an independent dynamical analysis of this region. We determine family memberships by applying a color taxonomy derived from Gaia data and by assessing the spectral similarity between candidate members and the template spectrum of each family. We identify an L- type asteroid family in the central Main Belt, with (460) Scania as its largest member. Analysis of the family's V-shape indicates that it is relatively old, with an estimated age of approximately 1 Gyr, which likely explains its non detection by the HCM. The family's existence is supported by statistical validation, and its distribution in proper element space is well reproduced by numerical simulations. Independent evidence from taxonomy, polarimetry, and spin-axis obliquities consistently supports the existence of this L- type family. This work highlights the value of combining dynamical and physical data to characterize asteroid families and raises questions about the origin of L- type families, potentially linked to primordial objects retaining early protoplanetary disk properties. Further spectroscopic data are needed to clarify these families.</description>

      <title>RAVEN: RAnking and Validation of ExoplaNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities, including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre, an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than 300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores &gt; 97% on all FP scenarios and &gt; 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%, demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.</description>

      <title>BepiColombo at Mercury: Three flybys, three magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the first three BepiColombo Mercury flybys Using data from the Miniature Ion Precipitation Analyzer (MIPA), an ion mass analyzer in the Search for Exospheric Refilling and Natural Abundances (SERENA) package on the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) designed to study magnetospheric dynamics. These flybys all passed from dusk to dawn through the nightside equatorial region but were noticeably different from each other. In the first flyby, we observe a low latitude boundary layer and $\sim$1 keV ions near closest approach. For flybys 2 and 3 we see ions up to 14 keV in the same location, including freshly injected precipitating ions inside the loss cone. High time resolution data from flyby 3 show variations consistent with bursty bulk flows 10s long and occurring over $\sim30$s periods, the first such observation in this region. MIPA data demonstrate that high-energy injection processes are an important source of precipitation ions at Mercury.</description>

      <title>Improving radial velocity precision with CARMENES-PLUS:An upgrade of the near-infrared spectrograph cooling system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CARMENES is a dual-channel high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope designed to detect low-mass planets around late-type dwarfs by measuring their radial velocities (RVs). High thermal stability in both the visible (VIS) and near infrared channels is essential to achieve the precision required for these measurements. In particular, stabilising the NIR channel to the millikelvin level, which operates at cryogenic temperatures (140 K), poses significant engineering challenges.The CARMENES-PLUS project was initiated to improve the instruments intrinsic RV precision. In this article, we focus on the thermal stability improvements made to the NIR channels cooling system. The NIR cooling system was originally conceived to operate with a discontinuous flow of cryogenic nitrogen gas. As part of CARMENES-PLUS, this was upgraded to a continuous flow configuration. Additional changes included the installation of an automatic vacuum system, a proportional control valve, and a pressure regulation system. These upgrades were designed to reduce thermal fluctuations and enhance long-term stability. The implemented upgrades significantly improved the intrinsic RV precision of the NIR channel. We quantified this improvement using Fabry Perot calibration spectra, obtaining an intrinsic RV precision of 0.67 ms after the interventions, an improvement of nearly 2 ms . We also assessed the stability of the nightly zero points, finding a reduced scatter of 3.9 ms post upgrade, compared to 6.1 ms before. For a sample of slowly rotating stars (vsin i below 2 kms), the median scatter decreased from 8.8 ms to 6.7 ms after the upgrades. These results demonstrate that the thermal control upgrades introduced in CARMENES PLUS have enhanced the NIR channels RV performance, bringing it closer to the VIS channels stability and reinforcing CARMENES capabilities for exoplanet detection around M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>A Decade of Transit-Timing Measurements Confirm Resonance in the K2-19 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-19 is a star, slightly smaller than the Sun, that hosts three transiting planets. Two of these, K2-19 b and c, are between the size of Neptune and Saturn and have orbital periods near a 3:2 commensurability, and exhibit strong transit-timing variations (TTVs). A previous TTV analysis reported moderate eccentricities of $\approx0.20 \pm0.03$ for the two planets, but such high values would imply rapid orbital decay for the innermost planet d. Here, we present an updated analysis that includes eight new transit times from TESS, which extends the time baseline from three years to a decade, and employ a gradient-aware TTV modeling code. We confirm that the system resides in resonance with a small libration amplitude, but find a broader constraints on eccentricity that range from a few percent up to 0.2. These revised eccentricities alleviate previous concerns regarding rapid tidal circularization and support the long-term dynamical stability of the system.</description>

      <title>Identifying rocky planets and water worlds among sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomers are debating whether the plentiful "sub-Neptune" exoplanets -- worlds a bit larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune -- are predominantly rocky planets, water-rich "ocean worlds," or gas-enshrouded mini-Neptunes. This question is crucial because such sub-Neptune-sized planets are among the most common in our galaxy, yet we have no analog in our own solar system, making them a key to understanding planet formation and diversity. It also directly impacts the search for habitable worlds: larger-than-Earth planets with solid surfaces or oceans could support life, whereas gas-rich mini-Neptunes likely cannot. However, distinguishing these types using only a planet's mass and radius is very challenging, because different compositions can produce similar densities, leaving a world's nature ambiguous with current data. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a future NASA flagship telescope, offers a solution. HWO could directly image and spectroscopically analyze starlight reflected from 50~100 sub-Neptunes around nearby stars, aiming to reveal their atmospheric compositions and potential surfaces. Using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy along with sensitive polarimetry, HWO would detect atmospheric gases (such as water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide) and search for telltale surface signatures, including rock absorption features and the characteristic reflectivity patterns of oceans. By analyzing these signals, we could determine whether sub-Neptunes are large rocky planets or water worlds rather than gas-dominated mini-Neptunes. Crucially, expanding the search beyond Earth-sized planets to include these abundant sub-Neptunes may uncover entirely new classes of potentially habitable worlds, directly advancing HWO's mission to identify and characterize planets that could support life.</description>

      <title>RX Gru: a short-period pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary with a distant circumbinary companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new short-period pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary, RX Gru, orbited by a distant circumbinary companion. We characterized the system by analysing the photometric observations from the Solaris network, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and the Super Wide Angle Search for Planets survey, combined with the radial velocities from four high-resolution spectrographs: HARPS, FEROS, CHIRON, and HRS. We derived the parameters of the eclipsing components, which are $M_{\rm Aa} = 1.004^{+0.027}_{-0.026}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Aa} = 1.007\pm0.021\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Aa} = 5379\pm289\,$K for the primary, and $M_{\rm Ab} = 0.985^{+0.024}_{-0.025}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Ab} = 1.024\pm0.023\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Ab} = 5322\pm278\,$K for the secondary. We determined the age of the system from the observed parameters using two evolution codes, MESA and Cesam2k20. We obtained an age of $\sim$28$\,$Myr, placing the two stars at the very end of the pre-main-sequence phase. We also derived the minimum mass and orbital period of the tertiary companion, which are found to be $M_{\rm B} = 89.0\pm3.5\,$M$_{\rm Jup}$ and $P_{\rm AB} = 23.79 ^{+0.10 }_{-0.25}\,$yr, respectively. We conclude that RX Gru consists of a tight inner binary composed of two twin components and an outer low-mass companion (a massive brown dwarf or a very low-mass star) in a relatively wide orbit, and we suggest that the system was formed via the dynamical unfolding mechanism coupled with the shared accretion of the circumbinary material by the binary components.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft Measurements of the Evolving Geometry of the Solar Alfv\'en Surface Over Half a Solar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of a star's Alfv\'en surface determines stellar angular momentum loss, separates a causally distinct 'corona' and stellar wind, and potentially affects exoplanetary habitability. The solar Alfv\'en surface is the only such structure that is directly measurable and since 2021, has been routinely measured in situ by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker). We use these unique measurements in concert with Solar Orbiter and L1 in situ data spanning the first half of the Solar Cycle 25 in time and from 0.045 - 1 au in heliocentric distance to develop a radial scaling technique to estimate the morphology of the Alfv\'en surface from measurements of the solar wind speed and local Alfv\'en speed. We show that accounting for solar wind acceleration and mass flux is necessary to achieve reasonable agreement between the scaled location of the Alfv\'en surface and the locations of direct crossings measured by Parker. We produce continuous 2D equatorial cuts of the Alfv\'en surface over half a Solar Cycle (ascending phase and maximum). Parker's earliest crossings clipped outward extrusions, many of which are likely transient related, while more recently Parker has unambiguously sampled deep sub-Alfv\'enic flows. We analyze the average altitude, departure from spherical symmetry, and surface roughness, finding that all are positively correlated to solar activity. For the current modest Solar Cycle, the height varies up to 30\% which corresponds to a near-doubling in angular momentum loss per unit mass loss.</description>

      <title>An idealized general circulation model for the atmospheric circulation on the ice giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are the least explored planets in the Solar System. A key question regarding the two planets is the similarity of their observed flows despite the great differences in their obliquity and internal heating. To answer this fundamental question and understand the ice giants atmospheric circulation, we developed a new general circulation model (GCM). This tool will also be key to facilitating the success of future missions to the ice giants, for which atmospheric flows will be a measurable quantity. Past GCMs for the ice giants have struggled to reproduce the observed winds on Uranus and Neptune. Using our idealized GCM, we systematically explored how the zonal wind and meridional circulation respond to different model and physical parameters; our main focus was on the depth of the domain. We show that in cases where the bottom layer of the model is deep enough, the simulated flow is independent of the meridional structure of the forcing temperature, indicating that dynamical processes, and not the imposed thermal forcing, are the dominant drivers of the circulation and the thermal structure. A momentum balance analysis further shows that meridional and vertical eddy momentum flux convergence are both central to maintaining the circulation. These results provide a physical explanation for the similarity of the flow on Uranus and Neptune although their solar and internal forcing are significantly different. The modeling framework developed in this study can serve as a foundation for the development of more comprehensive GCMs of the ice giants and help guide the interpretation of future mission data.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Dispersion Measurement at Hanle Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric dispersion introduces wavelength-dependent effects that significantly impact ground-based observations, particularly in slit- and fibre-fed spectroscopic studies. These effects reduce the signal entering the spectrograph and introduce systematic errors in radial velocity measurements. To address this challenge, atmospheric dispersion correctors are utilised. However, many existing designs of these correctors, which are based on theoretical models, often lack practical validation and consistency. The forthcoming National Large Optical Telescope (NLOT) will be installed at Hanle, a site known for its favourable astronomical sky conditions. Thus, the design of an effective dispersion corrector for the instruments on the NLOT, specifically one that compensates for the measured dispersion, is crucial. For the first time, we have directly measured atmospheric dispersion at the Hanle site using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. In this study, we present our methodology, the dispersion measurements obtained within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range, and a comparison with modelled dispersion values.</description>

      <title>Chromaticity of stellar activity in radial velocities : Anti-correlated families of lines on the M dwarf EV Lac with SPIRou and SOPHIE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In the search for exoplanets using radial velocities (RV), stellar activity has become one of the main limiting factors for detectability. Fortunately, activity-induced RV signals are wavelength-dependent or chromatic, unlike planetary signals. This study exploits the broad spectral coverage provided by the combined use of SOPHIE and SPIRou velocimeters to investigate the chromatic nature of the activity signal of the highly active M dwarf EV Lac.
  Aims. We aim to understand the origin of the strong wavelength dependence (chromaticity) observed in the RV signal of EV Lac by selecting spectral lines based on physical properties. In particular, we explore the impact of starspots by defining the contrast effect at the level of individual lines. The Zeeman effect is also considered in this study.
  Methods. SPIRou and SOPHIE spectra were reduced using the line-by-line (LBL) method. We performed custom RV calculations, using groups of spectral lines selected for their sensitivity to either the spot-to-photosphere contrast or the Zeeman effect. The sensi- tivity of each line to the spot is defined using a two-temperature model based on PHOENIX spectra, while Land\'e factors were used to quantify Zeeman sensitivity.
  Results. We find that the spectral lines are distributed in two distinct families of contrasts, producing anti-correlated RV signals. This leads to a partial cancellation of the total RV signal, especially at longer wavelengths and provides a natural explanation for the strong chromaticity observed in EV Lac. This sign-reversal effect is demonstrated here, for the first time, on empirical data. Building on this discovery, we propose a new approach to constraining spot temperatures and to mitigating stellar activity. This will open up promising avenues for improving activity corrections and enhancing the detection of exoplanets around active M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric Electron Heat Flow Modulates Planetary Ambipolar Electric Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ambipolar electrostatic field has long been recognized as a key driver of ion escape from planetary atmospheres. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the generation of this field is critical for understanding atmospheric escape and the evolution of habitability on terrestrial planets. Yet, existing comparisons between ambipolar diffusion theory and in-situ potential measurements have largely neglected the effect of electron heat flow. Confronting the theory incorporating heat-flow effect with in-situ electrical potential data from the \textit{Endurance} sounding rocket mission, we identify observational signatures of electron heat-flow effects. Furthermore, the implications of electron heat-flow effect across terrestrial planets are revealed, focusing on its capacity to resolve the enigma of Venusian electric potential drop anomaly. The anisotropic ion temperatures and the associated enhancement of electron heat-flow effect can explain the anomalous electric potential drop observed in the ionosphere of Venus.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale clustering and source separation of InSight mission seismic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16189v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised source separation involves unraveling an unknown set of source signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about the sources, and only access to a dataset of signal mixtures. This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as "glitches") and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>Metallicities from High-Resolution TRES Spectra with uberMS: Performance Benchmarks and Literature Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the field of exoplanetary astronomy has matured, demand has grown for precise stellar abundances to probe subtle correlations between stellar compositions and planetary demographics. However, drawing population-level conclusions from the disparate measurements in the literature is challenging, with various groups measuring metallicities using bespoke codes with differing line lists, radiative transfer models, and other assumptions. Homogeneous analyses are thus critical. Here we use the neural-net framework uberMS to measure iron abundances and alpha enrichments from high-resolution optical spectra observed by the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), a key resource used for the follow-up of candidate exoplanet hosts. To contextualize these measurements and benchmark our method's performance, we compare to external constraints on metallicity using the Hyades cluster, wide binaries, and asteroids, to external constraints on $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ using stars with interferometric radii, and to the results of other abundance measurement methods using overlap samples with the APOGEE and SPOCS catalogs, as well as by applying the SPC method directly to TRES spectra. We find that TRES-uberMS provides reliable parameter estimates with errors of roughly 100 K in $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.09 dex in $\log g$, and 0.04 dex in [Fe/H] for many nearby dwarf stars, although [Fe/H] performance is poorer for mid-to-late K dwarfs, with the bias worsening with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. Performance is also worse for evolved stars. For [$\alpha$/Fe], our error may be as good as 0.03 dex for dwarfs based on external benchmarks, despite sizable and variable systematic differences when comparing with specific alpha-element abundances from other catalogs.</description>
