      <title>The Piltz divisor Problem in Number Fields Using The Resonance Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Piltz divisor problem is a natural generalization of the classical Dirichlet divisor problem. In this paper, we study this problem over number fields and obtain improved $\Omega-$bounds for its error terms. Our approach involves generalizing a Voronoi-type formula due to Soundararajan in the number field setting, and applying a recent result due to the second author.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Error Bound for the TG Kernel in Prime Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish rigorous error bounds for prime counting using a truncated Gaussian (TG) kernel in the explicit formula framework. Our main theorem proves that the approximation error remains globally below 1/2 for all sufficiently large arguments, guaranteeing exact computation of {\pi}(x) through simple rounding, without relying on unproven hypotheses.
  The TG kernel construction employs Gaussian-like test functions with compact support, engineered with vanishing moments to eliminate main terms. For x with 10^8 decimal digits, we demonstrate that only ~1200 nontrivial zeta zeros suffice to achieve the error bound, enabling computation in seconds on modern hardware - a dramatic improvement over classical methods.
  Key contributions include: (1) Explicit tail truncation bounds using Taylor remainder analysis, showing exponential decay; (2) Zero-sum truncation error bounds via unconditional density estimates; (3) Rigorous treatment of trivial zero contributions. All constants are made explicit, ensuring full verifiability.
  The method bridges analytic number theory and practical computation, with potential applications to record-breaking prime counting computations. We discuss algorithmic implications including FFT-based arithmetic for ~330 million bit numbers. The framework's flexibility suggests connections to deeper structures in prime distribution, particularly regarding optimized kernel designs and the interplay between smoothing parameters {\alpha} and truncation heights.
  This work exemplifies how classical analytic techniques, when carefully implemented with modern computational perspectives, yield practical algorithms for problems previously considered purely theoretical. The rigorous error analysis ensures reliability even at astronomical scales, opening new avenues for computational number theory research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a survey of Ecalle's theory of flexion units. In particular, we provide complete proofs of several key assertions that were stated without proof in Ecalle's original works. These results are crucial for understanding applications of flexion units to the theory of multiple zeta values and the Kashiwara-Vergne problem.</description>

      <title>Chabauty Limits of Fermat Spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Fermat spiral is a set of points of the form $\sqrt{n}e^{2\pi i\alpha n}$ for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. In this paper we prove that the Chabauty limits of Fermat spirals are always closed subgroups of $\mathbb{R}^2$, and conclude that no Fermat spirals are dense forests. Furthermore, we show that if $\alpha$ is badly approximable the Chabauty limits are always lattices, for which we give a characterisation.</description>

      <title>On sesquilinear forms over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of sesquilinear forms over finite fields, investigating their representations via polynomials and coefficient matrices, along with classification results for these forms. Through their connection to quadratic forms, we calculate certain character sums to resolve enumeration problems for equations defined by sesquilinear forms. This provides a characterization of a class of maximal or minimal Artin-Schreier curves with explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Unbounded knapsack problem and double partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unbounded knapsack problem can be considered as a particular case of the double partition problem that asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of two linear Diophantine equations with integer coefficients. In the middle of 19th century Sylvester and Cayley suggested an approach based on the variable elimination allowing a reduction of a double partition to a sum of scalar partitions. This manuscript discusses a geometric interpretation of this method and its application to the knapsack problem.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of shapes of pure quartic number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of a number field is a subtle arithmetic invariant arising from the geometry of numbers. It is defined as the equivalence class of the lattice of integers with respect to linear operations that are composites of rotations, reflections, and positive scalar dilations. For a number field of degree $n$, the shape is a point in the space of shapes $\mathscr{S}_{n-1}$, which is the double quotient $GL_{n-1}(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash GL_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}) / GO_{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we investigate the distribution of shapes in the family of pure quartic fields $K_m = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[4]{m})$. We prove that the shape of $K_m$ lies on one of ten explicitly described torus orbits in $\mathscr{S}_3$, determined by the sign and residue class of $m \bmod 32$. It is shown that the shape on a given torus orbit is completely determined by two parameters, one of which varies continuously, while the other takes values in a discrete set. As a result, the distribution of shapes in this family is governed by a product of a continuous and a discrete measure. Our results shed new light on a question posed by Manjul Bhargava and Piper H concerning the distribution of shapes in families of non-generic number fields of fixed degree. Notably, the limiting distribution in our case does not arise as the restriction of the natural measure on $\mathscr{S}_3$ induced by Haar measure on $GL_3(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>2-Selmer companion modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a positive integer and $K$ be a number field. Suppose that $f_1,f_2 \in S_k(\Gamma_0(N))$ are two newforms such that their residual Galois representations at $2$ are isomorphic. Let $\omega_2: G_{\mathbb Q} \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}^*_2$ be the $2$-adic cyclotomic character. Then, under suitable hypotheses, we have shown that for every quadratic character $\chi$ of $K$ and each critical twist $j$, the residual Greenberg $2$-Selmer groups of $f_1\chi\omega_2^{-j}$ and $f_2\chi\omega_2^{-j}$ over $K$ are isomorphic. This generalizes the corresponding result of Mazur-Rubin on $2$-Selmer companion elliptic curves. Conversely, if the difference of the residual Greenberg (respectively Bloch-Kato) $2$-Selmer ranks of $f_1\chi$ and $f_2\chi$ is bounded independent of every quadratic character $\chi$ of $K$, then under suitable hypotheses we have shown that the residual Galois representations at $2$ of $f_1$ and $f_2$ are isomorphic as $G_K$-modules. The corresponding result for elliptic curves was a conjecture of Mazur-Rubin, which was proved by M. Yu.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\phi(n)$ be the Euler totient function and $\phi_k(n)$ its $k$-fold iterate. In this note, we improve the upper bound for the number of positive $n\leqslant x$ such that $\phi_{k+1}(n)\geqslant cn$. Comparing with the upper bound which was obtained from Pollack's asymptotic formula of the summation of $\phi_{k+1}(n)$ for $n\leqslant x$, we have successfully increased the denominator exponent of the main term of the upper bound from $k$ to $k+1$.</description>

      <title>A 2-adic automorphy lifting theorem for symplectic groups over totally real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new automorphy lifting theorem for certain 2-adic Galois representations $\rho:G_F\longrightarrow {\rm GSp}_{2n}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_2)$ where $F$ an arbitrary totally real field. This extends the minimal case previously established by Thorne to the non-minimal case. A key ingredient is a detailed analysis for the residual monodromy representations associated to the Dwork family in characteristic two. As an application, combining with the author's previous work with Tsuzuki, we prove the automorphy of certain rank 4 symplectic motives over $F$ coming from the Dwork quintic family under suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>The completed Kirillov model and local-global compatibility for functions on Igusa varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the cuspidal functions $\mathbb{V}_b^{\mathrm{cusp}}$ on the ordinary Caraiani-Scholze Igusa variety for $\mathrm{GL}_2$ as a completion of the smooth Kirillov model for classical cuspidal modular forms, and identify a variant of Hida's ordinary $p$-adic modular forms with the coinvariants of an action of $\tilde{\mu}_{p^\infty}$ on $\mathbb{V}_b^{\mathrm{cusp}}$. As a consequence of these results, we establish a weak local-global compatibility theorem for eigenspaces in $\mathbb{V}_b^{\mathrm{cusp}}$ associated to classical cuspidal modular forms. Based on these results, we conjecture an analog of Hida theory and an associated local-global compatibility for functions on more general Caraiani-Scholze Igusa varieties, which are natural spaces of $p$-adic automorphic forms.</description>

      <title>Some Mathematical Problems Behind Lattice-Based Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1994, P. Shor discovered quantum algorithms which can break both the RSA cryptosystem and the ElGamal cryptosystem. In 2007, D-Wave demonstrated the first quantum computer. These events and further developments have brought a crisis to secret communication. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a global project to solicit and select a handful of encryption algorithms with the ability to resist quantum computer attacks. In 2022, it announced four candidates, CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon and Sphincs$+$ for post-quantum cryptography standards. The first three are based on lattice theory and the last on the Hash function. It is well known that the security of the lattice-based cryptosystems relies on the computational complexity of the shortest vector problem (SVP), the closest vector problem (CVP) and their generalizations. In fact, the SVP is a ball packing problem and the CVP is a ball covering problem. Furthermore, both SVP and CVP are equivalent to arithmetic problems for positive definite quadratic forms. Therefore, post-quantum cryptography provides unprecedented opportunities for mathematicians to make contributions in modern technology. This paper will briefly review the mathematical problems on which the lattice-based cryptography is built up, so that mathematicians can see that they are indeed in the game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $\mathcal G = (\mathcal V, \mathcal E)$ is said to satisfy the Neighbour Sum Property if there exists some $f:\mathcal V\to\mathbb R$ such that $f\not\equiv 0$ and it maps every vertex to the sum of the values taken by its neighbours. In this article, we provide an algorithm to check whether a given finite tree satisfies the neighbour sum property. We also find a large class of trees on $n$ vertices that satisfy the property.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.07516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recast the Galois cohomology of the variety $V$ over a number field $k$ in terms of the K-theory of a $C^*$-algebra $\mathscr{A}_V$ connected to $V$. It is proved that $V$ is isomorphic to $V'$ over $k$ (algebraic closure of $k$, resp.) if and only if $\mathscr{A}_V$ is isomorphic (Morita equivalent, resp.) to $\mathscr{A}_{V'}$. In particular, the Morita equivalent $C^*$-algebras $\mathscr{A}_V$ parametrize twists of the variety $V$. The case of rational elliptic curves is considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Automorphic congruences between torsion cohomological classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two representations of some local division algebra, congruent modulo $l$, giving rise to two Harris-Taylor local systems on the corresponding Newton strata of the special fiber of a KHT Shimura varieties, we prove that the $l$-torsion of each of their cohomology groups with compact supports are isomorphic, or equivalently the free quotients of each of the cohomology groups are congruent modulo $l$. We then deduce the construction of accurate non tempered automorphic congruences for a similitude group $G/\mathbb Q$ with signature $(1,d-1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that smooth numbers are equidistributed in arithmetic progressions to moduli of size $x^{66/107-o(1)}$. This overcomes a longstanding barrier of $x^{3/5-o(1)}$ present in previous works of Bombieri-Friedlander-Iwaniec, Fouvry-Tenenbaum, Drappeau, and Maynard. We build on Drappeau's variation of the dispersion method and on exponential sum manipulations of Maynard, ultimately relying on optimized Deshouillers-Iwaniec type estimates for sums of Kloosterman sums.</description>

Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the action of a geometric Hecke correspondence on special cycles on a Shimura variety in terms of such cycles at a fixed neat level and compare it with another closely related expression sometimes used in literature.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate permutation polynomials over the finite field $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ with $q=2^m$, focusing on those in the form $\mathrm{Tr}(Ax^{q+1})+L(x)$, where $A\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ and $L$ is a $2$-linear polynomial over $\mathbb F_{q^n}$. By calculating certain character sums, we characterize these permutation polynomials and provide additional constructions.</description>

      <title>Integer Powers Expressed as Nested Sums of Lower Powers modulo 2, 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore identities that allow for representation of positive integers raised to positive integral powers as sums of nested sums of smaller positive integral powers. We begin by establishing the base identity involving consecutive descending powers, which we then employ to construct a simple proof of Fermat's Little Theorem. After that, the focus shifts to deriving and rigorously proving a more intricate identity that represents integer powers as nested sums of descending powers of the same parity, i.e., descending powers modulo 2. The discussion is concluded by stating a prominent identity that allows for the representation of integer powers by lower powers modulo 3.</description>

      <title>The Quadratic and Cubic Characters of 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solvability of the cubic congruence $x^{3}\equiv 2\pmod{p}$ is referred to as the $\textit{cubic character of 2}$. In evaluating the cubic character of 2, we introduce the Eisenstein integers, Gauss and Jacobi sums, and the law of cubic reciprocity. We motivate this proof by giving ample historical information surrounding the early development of higher reciprocity laws as well as Gauss' proof of the solvability of the quadratic congruence $x^{2}\equiv 2\pmod{p}$; conventionally the $\textit{quadratic character of 2}$. We simultaneously outline other relevant contributions by Fermat, Euler, Legendre, Jacobi, and Eisenstein.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the restriction of modular forms such as Ikeda type lifts and the Eisenstein series on the exceptional group of type $E_{7,3}$ to the symplectic group $Sp_6$ (rank 3). As an application, we explicitly write down the restriction when modular forms have small weight. The restriction may contain Miyawaki lifts of type I,II (CAP forms) and genuine forms whose description is compatible with Arthur's classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly compute two kinds of algebraic Belyi functions on Bring's curve. One is related to a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the other is related to a congruence subgroup of the triangle group $\Delta(2,4,5)\subset \SL_2(\R)$. To carry out the computation, we use elliptic cusp forms of weight 2 for the former case and the automorphism group of Bring's curve for the latter case. We also discuss a suitable base field (a number field) for describing isomorphisms between Hulek-Craig's curve, Bring's curve, and another algebraic model obtained as a modular curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer $ n \geq 2 $, its prime factorization is expressed as $ n = \prod p_i^{a_i} $. We define the function $ f(n) $ as the smallest positive integer satisfying the following condition: \[ \nu_{p}\left(\frac{f(n)!}{n}\right) \geq 0, \quad \forall p \in \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_s\}, \] where $ \nu_{p}(m) $ denotes the $ p $-adic valuation of $ m $. The main objective of this paper is to derive an asymptotic formula for both sums $ \sum_{n\leq x} f(n) $ and $ \sum_{n \leq x, n \in S_k} f(n) $, where $ S_k $ denotes the set of all $ k $-free integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a positive integer $N$, let $\chi_{\lambda}(\mu)$ be the value of the irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_{N}$ associated with $\lambda$, evaluated at the conjugacy class of elements whose cycle type is determined by $\mu$. Let $Z(N)$ be the number of zeros in the character table of $S_N$, and $Z_{t}(N)$ be defined as
  $$
  Z_{t}(N):= \#\{(\lambda,\mu): \chi_{\lambda}(\mu) = 0 \; \text{with $\lambda$ a $t$-core}\}.
  $$
  We establish the bound
  $$
  Z(N) \geq \frac{2p(N)^{2}}{1.01e \log N} \left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{\log N}\right)\right)
  $$
  where $p(N)$ denotes the number of partitions of $N$. Also, we give lower bounds for $Z_t(N)$ in different ranges of $t$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that both primes and smooth numbers are equidistributed in arithmetic progressions to moduli up to $x^{5/8 - o(1)}$, using triply-well-factorable weights for the primes (we also get improvements for the well-factorable linear sieve weights). This completely eliminates the dependency on Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture in previous works of Lichtman and the author, which built in turn on results of Maynard and Drappeau. We rely on recent large sieve inequalities for exceptional Maass forms of the author for additively-structured sequences, and on a related result of Watt for multiplicatively-structured sequences. As applications, we prove refined upper bounds for the counts of twin primes and consecutive smooth numbers up to $x$.</description>

      <title>Diophantine Equations over $\mathbb Z$: Universal Bounds and Parallel Formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores multiple closely related themes: bounding the complexity of Diophantine equations over the integers and developing mathematical proofs in parallel with formal theorem provers.
  Hilbert's Tenth Problem (H10) asks about the decidability of Diophantine equations and has been answered negatively by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich. It is natural to ask for which subclasses of Diophantine equations H10 remains undecidable. Such subclasses can be defined in terms of universal pairs: bounds on the number of variables $\nu$ and degree $\delta$ such that all Diophantine equations can be rewritten in at most this complexity. Our work develops explicit universal pairs $(\nu, \delta)$ for integer unknowns, achieving new bounds that cannot be obtained by naive translations from known results over $\mathbb N$.
  In parallel, we have conducted a formal verification of our results using the proof assistant Isabelle. While formal proof verification has traditionally been applied a posteriori to known results, this project integrates formalization into the discovery and development process. In a final section, we describe key insights gained from this unusual approach and its implications for mathematical practice. Our work contributes both to the study of Diophantine equations and to the broader question of how mathematics is conducted in the 21st century.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.06165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an order, a commutative ring whose additive group is free of finite rank, a natural computational question is whether a fixed univariate polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ has a root in this ring. In this paper, we show that the computational difficulty of this depends strongly on the arithmetic properties of $f$. We show that with probability 1, determining whether $f$ has a root is NP-complete. For $\text{deg } f \leq 3$ we give a full classification of the computational complexity: some special $f$ admit a polynomial-time algorithm, and for all other $f$ the problem is NP-complete. Additionally, we prove the problem is undecidable for $f = (X^2+1)^2$, conditional on Hilberts Tenth Problem for $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. The key ingredients for proving NP-completeness are a new source of NP-complete group-theoretic problems developed in previous work, and a full classification of cubic polynomials with discriminant divisible only by $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.06794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study principally polarized abelian varieties that admit an automorphism of prime order $p&gt;2$. It turns out that certain natural conditions on the multiplicities of its action on the differentials of the first kind do guarantee that those polarized varieties are not jacobians of curves.</description>

      <title>On sets with missing differences in compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density for $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density for $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</description>

      <title>The Theory Of Auxiliary Weierstrassian Zeta Functions And Zeta Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand the theory of Weierstrassian elliptic functions by introducing auxiliary zeta functions $\zeta_\lambda$, zeta differences of first kind $\Delta_\lambda$ and second kind $\Delta_{\lambda,\mu}$ where $\lambda,\mu=1,2,3$. Fundamental and novel results pertaining to these functions are proven. Furthermore, results already existing in the literature are translated in terms of auxiliary zeta functions. Their relationship to Jacobian elliptic functions and Jacobian functions are given.</description>

      <title>Mock modularity at work, or black holes in a forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>
