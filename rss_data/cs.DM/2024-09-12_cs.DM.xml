      <title>Upper bounds on minimum size of feedback arc set of directed multigraphs with bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An oriented multigraph is a directed multigraph without directed 2-cycles. Let ${\rm fas}(D)$ denote the minimum size of a feedback arc set in an oriented multigraph $D$. The degree of a vertex is the sum of its out- and in-degrees. In several papers, upper bounds for ${\rm fas}(D)$ were obtained for oriented multigraphs $D$ with maximum degree upper-bounded by a constant. Hanauer (2017) conjectured that ${\rm fas}(D)\le 2.5n/3$ for every oriented multigraph $D$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most 5. We prove a strengthening of the conjecture: ${\rm fas}(D)\le m/3$ holds for every oriented multigraph $D$ with $m$ arcs and maximum degree at most 5. This bound is tight and improves a bound of Berger and Shor (1990,1997). It would be interesting to determine $c$ such that ${\rm fas}(D)\le cn$ for every oriented multigraph $D$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most 5 such that the bound is tight. We show that $\frac{5}{7}\le c \le \frac{24}{29} &lt; \frac{2.5}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Basis sequence reconfiguration in the union of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and two spanning trees $T$ and $T'$ in $G$, Spanning Tree Reconfiguration asks whether there is a step-by-step transformation from $T$ to $T'$ such that all intermediates are also spanning trees of $G$, by exchanging an edge in $T$ with an edge outside $T$ at a single step. This problem is naturally related to matroid theory, which shows that there always exists such a transformation for any pair of $T$ and $T'$. Motivated by this example, we study the problem of transforming a sequence of spanning trees into another sequence of spanning trees. We formulate this problem in the language of matroid theory: Given two sequences of bases of matroids, the goal is to decide whether there is a transformation between these sequences. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, even if the matroids are given as basis oracles. To complement this algorithmic result, we show that the problem of finding a shortest transformation is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $c \log n$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, where $n$ is the total size of the ground sets of the input matroids.</description>

      <title>Interaction graphs of isomorphic automata networks II: universal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An automata network with $n$ components over a finite alphabet $Q$ of size $q$ is a discrete dynamical system described by the successive iterations of a function $f:Q^n\to Q^n$. In most applications, the main parameter is the interaction graph of $f$: the digraph with vertex set $[n]$ that contains an arc from $j$ to $i$ if $f_i$ depends on input $j$. What can be said on the set $\mathbb{G}(f)$ of the interaction graphs of the automata networks isomorphic to $f$? It seems that this simple question has never been studied. In a previous paper, we prove that the complete digraph $K_n$, with $n^2$ arcs, is universal in that $K_n\in \mathbb{G}(f)$ whenever $f$ is not constant nor the identity (and $n\geq 5$). In this paper, taking the opposite direction, we prove that there exists universal automata networks $f$, in that $\mathbb{G}(f)$ contains all the digraphs on $[n]$, excepted the empty one. Actually, we prove that the presence of only three specific digraphs in $\mathbb{G}(f)$ implies the universality of $f$, and we prove that this forces the alphabet size $q$ to have at least $n$ prime factors (with multiplicity). However, we prove that for any fixed $q\geq 3$, there exists almost universal functions, that is, functions $f:Q^n\to Q^n$ such that the probability that a random digraph belongs to $\mathbb{G}(f)$ tends to $1$ as $n\to\infty$. We do not know if this holds in the binary case $q=2$, providing only partial results.</description>

      <title>Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge encourages community approaches to developing new solutions for analyzing graphs and sparse data derived from social media, sensor feeds, and scientific data to discover relationships between events as they unfold in the field. The anonymized network sensing Graph Challenge seeks to enable large, open, community-based approaches to protecting networks. Many large-scale networking problems can only be solved with community access to very broad data sets with the highest regard for privacy and strong community buy-in. Such approaches often require community-based data sharing. In the broader networking community (commercial, federal, and academia) anonymized source-to-destination traffic matrices with standard data sharing agreements have emerged as a data product that can meet many of these requirements. This challenge provides an opportunity to highlight novel approaches for optimizing the construction and analysis of anonymized traffic matrices using over 100 billion network packets derived from the largest Internet telescope in the world (CAIDA). This challenge specifies the anonymization, construction, and analysis of these traffic matrices. A GraphBLAS reference implementation is provided, but the use of GraphBLAS is not required in this Graph Challenge. As with prior Graph Challenges the goal is to provide a well-defined context for demonstrating innovation. Graph Challenge participants are free to select (with accompanying explanation) the Graph Challenge elements that are appropriate for highlighting their innovations.</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA) for classes of finite $n$-partite tournaments for $n \in \{2,3,\ldots,\omega\}$, and for the class of finite semigeneric tournaments. We also prove that the generic $\omega$-partite tournament and the generic semigeneric tournament have ample generics.</description>

      <title>Upward Pointset Embeddings of Planar st-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upward pointset embeddings (UPSEs) of planar $st$-graphs. Let $G$ be a planar $st$-graph and let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|= |V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$ that maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the problem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and the problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing is NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed $st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is possible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and to enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an $n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which can be tested in $O(n \log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an algorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing monotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$ space, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.</description>
