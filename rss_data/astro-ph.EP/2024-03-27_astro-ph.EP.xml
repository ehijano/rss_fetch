      <title>A Perfect Tidal Storm: HD 104067 Planetary Architecture Creating an Incandescent World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of planetary systems beyond the solar system has revealed a diversity of architectures, most of which differ significantly from our system. The initial detection of an exoplanet is often followed by subsequent discoveries within the same system as observations continue, measurement precision is improved, or additional techniques are employed. The HD 104067 system is known to consist of a bright K dwarf host star and a giant planet in a $\sim$55 day period eccentric orbit. Here we report the discovery of an additional planet within the HD 104067 system, detected through the combined analysis of radial velocity data from the HIRES and HARPS instruments. The new planet has a mass similar to Uranus and is in an eccentric $\sim$14 day orbit. Our injection-recovery analysis of the radial velocity data exclude Saturn-mass and Jupiter-mass planets out to 3 AU and 8 AU, respectively. We further present TESS observations that reveal a terrestrial planet candidate ($R_p = 1.30\pm0.12$ $R_\oplus$) in a $\sim$2.2~day period orbit. Our dynamical analysis of the three planet model shows that the two outer planets produce significant eccentricity excitation of the inner planet, resulting in tidally induced surface temperatures as high as $\sim$2600 K for an emissivity of unity. The terrestrial planet candidate may therefore be caught in a tidal storm, potentially resulting in its surface radiating at optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Large Fluctuations within 1 AU in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are often assumed to change slowly and smoothly during planet formation. Here, we investigate the time evolution of isolated disks subject to viscosity and a disk wind. The viscosity is assumed to increase rapidly at around 900 K due to thermal ionization of alkali metals, or thermionic and ion emission from dust, and the onset of magneto-rotational instability (MRI). The disks generally undergo large, rapid fluctuations for a wide range of time-averaged mass accretion rates. Fluctuations involve coupled waves in temperature and surface density that move radially in either direction through the inner 1.5 AU of the disk. Two types of wave are seen with radial speeds of roughly 50 and 1000 cm/s respectively. The pattern of waves repeats with a period of roughly 10,000 years that depends weakly on the average mass accretion rate. Viscous transport due to MRI is confined to the inner disk. This region is resupplied by mass flux from the outer disk driven by the disk wind. Interior to 1 AU, the temperature and surface density can vary by a factor of 2--10 on timescales of years to ky. The stellar mass accretion rate varies by 3 orders of magnitude on a similar timescale. This behavior lasts for at least 1 My for initial disks comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula.</description>

      <title>Vortex Fiber Nulling for Exoplanet Observations: First Direct Detection of M Dwarf Companions around HIP 21543, HIP 94666, and HIP 50319</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex fiber nulling (VFN) is a technique for detecting and characterizing faint companions at small separations from their host star. A near-infrared ($\sim2.3 \mu$m) VFN demonstrator mode was deployed on the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) instrument at the Keck Observatory and presented earlier. In this paper, we present the first VFN companion detections. Three targets, HIP 21543 Ab, HIP 94666 Ab, and HIP 50319 B, were detected with host-companion flux ratios between 70 and 430 at and within one diffraction beamwidth ($\lambda/D$). We complement the spectra from KPIC VFN with flux ratio and position measurements from the CHARA Array to validate the VFN results and provide a more complete characterization of the targets. This paper reports the first direct detection of these three M dwarf companions, yielding their first spectra and flux ratios. Our observations provide measurements of bulk properties such as effective temperatures, radial velocities, and v$\sin{i}$, and verify the accuracy of the published orbits. These detections corroborate earlier predictions of the KPIC VFN performance, demonstrating that the instrument mode is ready for science observations.</description>

      <title>A possibly solar metallicity atmosphere escaping from HAT-P-32b revealed by H$\alpha$ and He absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hydrodynamic simulation that couples detailed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) calculations of the hydrogen and helium level populations to model the H$\alpha$ and He 10830 transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b. A Monte Carlo simulation is applied to calculate the number of Ly$\alpha$ resonance scatterings, which is the main process for populating H(2). In the examined parameter space, only the models with H/He $\geq$ 99.5/0.5, $(0.5 \sim 3.0)$ times the fiducial value of $F_{\rm XUV}$, $\beta_m = 0.16\sim 0.3$, can explain the H$\alpha$ and He 10830 lines simultaneously. We find a mass-loss rate of $\sim (1.0\sim 3.1) \times 10^{13}$ g s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous studies. Moreover, we find that the stellar Ly$\alpha$ flux should be as high as $4 \times 10^{5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, indicating high stellar activity during the observation epoch of the two absorption lines. Despite the fact that the metallicity in the lower atmosphere of HAT-P-32b may be super-solar, our simulations tentatively suggest it is close to solar in the upper atmosphere. The difference in metallicity between the lower and upper atmospheres is essential for future atmospheric characterisations.</description>

      <title>Interior Controls on the Habitability of Rocky Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No matter how fascinating and exotic other terrestrial planets are revealed to be, nothing generates more excitement than announcements regarding their habitability. From the observation of Mars to present-day efforts toward Venus and the characterization of exoplanets, the search for life, or at least environments that could accommodate life, has been a major drive for space exploration. So far, we have found no other unquestionably habitable world besides Earth. The conditions of the habitability of terrestrial planets have proved elusive, as surface conditions depend on the complex interplay of many processes throughout the evolution of a planet. Here, we review how the interior of a rocky planet can drive the evolution of surface conditions and the atmosphere. Instead of listing criteria assumed to be critical for life, we discuss how the bulk-silicate planet can affect the onset, continuation and cessation of habitability. We then consider how it can be observed and current efforts towards this end.</description>

      <title>Looking For Timing Variations in the Transits of 16 Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the ephemerides of 16 transiting exoplanets using our ground-based observations, new TESS data, and previously published observations including those of amateur astronomers. All these light curves were modeled by making use of a set of quantitative criteria with the EXOFAST code to obtain mid-transit times. We searched for statistically significant secular and/or periodic trends in the mid-transit times. We found that the timing data are well modeled by a linear ephemeris for all systems except for XO-2 b, for which we detect an orbital decay with the rate of -12.95 $\pm$ 1.85 ms/yr that can be confirmed with future observations. We also detect a hint of potential periodic variations in the TTV data of HAT-P-13 b which also requires confirmation with further precise observations.</description>

      <title>Giant planet formation in the solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation history of Jupiter has been of interest due to its ability to shape the solar system's history. Yet little attention has been paid to the formation and growth of Saturn and the other giant planets. Here, we explore the implications of the simplest disc and pebble accretion model with steady-state accretion on the formation of giant planets in the solar system through N-body simulations. We conducted a statistical survey of different disc parameters and initial conditions of the protoplanetary disc to establish which combination best reproduces the present outer solar system. We examined the effect of the initial planetesimal disc mass, the number of planetesimals and their size-frequency distribution slope, pebble accretion prescription, and sticking efficiency on the likelihood of forming gas giants and their orbital distribution. The results reveal that the accretion sticking efficiency is the most sensitive parameter for controlling the final masses and number of giant planets. We have been unable to replicate the formation of all three types of giant planets in the solar system in a single simulation. The probability distribution of the final location of the giant planets is approximately constant in $\log r$, suggesting there is a slight preference for formation closer to the Sun but no preference for more massive planets to form closer. The eccentricity distribution has a higher mean for more massive planets, indicating that systems with more massive planets are more violent. The formation timescales of the cores of the gas giants are distinct, suggesting that they formed sequentially.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of the Uranian satellite system I. From the 5/3 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion resonance to the present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual gravitational interactions between the five major Uranian satellites raise small quasi-periodic fluctuations on their orbital elements. At the same time, tidal interactions between the satellites and the planet induce a slow outward drift of the orbits, while damping the eccentricities and the inclinations. In this paper, we revisit the current and near past evolution of this system using a N-body integrator, including spin evolution and tidal dissipation with the weak friction model. We update the secular eigenmodes of the system and show that it is unlikely that any of the main satellites were recently captured into a high obliquity Cassini state. We rather expect that the Uranian satellites are in a low obliquity Cassini state and compute their values. We also show that the current eccentricities of the satellites are not forced, and estimate the free eccentricities and inclinations. We constrain the quality factor of Uranus to be $Q_U = (8.6 \pm 2.9)\times10^3$, and that of the satellites to be $Q_S \sim 500$. We find that the system most likely encountered the 5/3 mean motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel in the past, at about ($0.7\pm0.2$) Gyr ago. We additionally determine the eccentricities and inclinations of all satellites just after the resonance passage that comply with the current system. We finally show that, from the crossing of the 5/3 MMR to the present, the evolution of the system is mostly peaceful and dominated by tides raised on Uranus by the satellites.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of the Uranian satellite system II. Crossing of the 5/3 Ariel-Umbriel mean motion resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, the main satellites of Uranus are not involved in any low order mean motion resonance (MMR). However, owing to tides raised in the planet, Ariel and Umbriel most likely crossed the 5/3 MMR in the past. Previous studies on this resonance passage relied on limited time-consuming N-body simulations or simplified models focusing solely on the effects of the eccentricity or the inclination. In this paper, we aim to provide a more comprehensive view on how the system evaded capture in the 5/3 MMR. For that purpose, we developed a secular resonant two-satellite model with low eccentricities and low inclinations, including tides using the weak friction model. By performing a large number of numerical simulations, we show that capture in the 5/3 MMR is certain if the initial eccentricities of Ariel, $e_1$, and Umbriel, $e_2$, are related through $(e_1^2 + e_2^2)^{1/2} &lt; 0.007$. Moreover, we observe that the eccentricity of Ariel is the key variable to evade the 5/3 MMR with a high probability. We determine that for $e_1 &gt; 0.015$ and $e_2 &lt; 0.01$, the system avoids capture in at least 60\% of the cases. We also show that, to replicate the currently observed system, the initial inclinations of Ariel and Umbriel must lay within $I_1 \leq 0.05^{\circ}$ and $0.06^{\circ} \leq I_2 \leq 0.11^{\circ}$, respectively. We checked these results using a complete N-body model with the five main satellites and did not observe any significant differences.</description>

      <title>The instability mechanism of compact multiplanet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve our understanding of orbital instabilities in compact planetary systems, we compare suites of $N$-body simulations against numerical integrations of simplified dynamical models. We show that, surprisingly, dynamical models that account for small sets of resonant interactions between the planets can accurately recover $N$-body instability times. This points towards a simple physical picture in which a handful of three-body resonances (3BRs), generated by interactions between nearby two-body mean motion resonances (MMRs), overlap and drive chaotic diffusion, leading to instability. Motivated by this, we show that instability times are well-described by a power law relating instability time to planet separations, measured in units of fractional semi-major axis difference divided by the planet-to-star mass ratio to the $1/4$ power, rather than the frequently-adopted $1/3$ power implied by measuring separations in units of mutual Hill radii. For idealized systems, the parameters of this power-law relationship depend only on the ratio of the planets' orbital eccentricities to the orbit-crossing value, and we report an empirical fit to enable quick instability time predictions. This relationship predicts that observed systems comprised of three or more sub-Neptune mass planets must be spaced with period ratios $\mathcal{P} \gtrsim 1.35$ and that tightly-spaced systems ($\mathcal{P} \lesssim 1.5$) must possess very low eccentricities ($e \lesssim 0.05$) to be stable for more than $10^9$ orbits.</description>

      <title>Detailed cool star flare morphology with CHEOPS and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. White-light stellar flares are proxies for some of the most energetic types of flares, but their triggering mechanism is still poorly understood. As they are associated with strong X and UV emission, their study is particularly relevant to estimate the amount of high-energy irradiation onto the atmospheres of exoplanets, especially those in their stars' habitable zone. Aims. We used the high-cadence, high-photometric capabilities of the CHEOPS and TESS space telescopes to study the detailed morphology of white-light flares occurring in a sample of 130 late-K and M stars, and compared our findings with results obtained at a lower cadence. We developed dedicated software for this purpose. Results. Multi-peak flares represent a significant percentage ($\gtrsim 30$\%) of the detected outburst events. Our findings suggest that high-impulse flares are more frequent than suspected from lower-cadence data, so that the most impactful flux levels that hit close-in exoplanets might be more time-limited than expected. We found significant differences in the duration distributions of single-peak and complex flare components, but not in their peak luminosity. A statistical analysis of the flare parameter distributions provides marginal support for their description with a log-normal instead of a power-law function, leaving the door open to several flare formation scenarios. We tentatively confirmed previous results about quasi-periodic pulsations in high-cadence photometry, report the possible detection of a pre-flare dip, and did not find hints of photometric variability due to an undetected flare background. Conclusions. The high-cadence study of stellar hosts might be crucial to evaluate the impact of their flares on close-in exoplanets, as their impulsive phase emission might otherwise be incorrectly estimated. Future telescopes such as PLATO and Ariel will help in this respect.</description>

      <title>Global Chemical Transport on Hot Jupiters: Insights from 2D VULCAN photochemical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atmospheric dynamics of tidally-locked hot Jupiters is characterized by strong equatorial winds. Understanding the interaction between global circulation and chemistry is crucial in atmospheric studies and interpreting observations. Two-dimensional (2D) photochemical transport models shed light on how the atmospheric composition depends on circulation. In this paper, we introduce the 2D photochemical (horizontal and vertical) transport model, VULCAN 2D, which improves on the pseudo-2D approaches by allowing for non-uniform zonal winds. We extensively validate our VULCAN 2D with analytical solutions and benchmark comparisons. Applications to HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b reveal a transition in mixing regimes: horizontal transport predominates below $\sim$0.1 mbar while vertical mixing is more important at higher altitudes above 0.1 mbar. Motivated by the previously inferred carbon-rich atmosphere, we find that HD 209458 b with super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) exhibits pronounced C$_2$H$_4$ absorption on the morning limb but not on the evening limb, owing to horizontal transport from the nightside. We discuss when a pseudo-2D approach is a valid assumption and its inherent limitations. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of horizontal transport in transmission observations and its impact on the morning-evening limb asymmetry with synthetic spectra, highlighting the need to consider global transport when interpreting exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N : A $\mathcal{O}(N)$ software for N-body integration in collisional and fragmenting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is a $N$-body software developed for the time-efficient integration of collisional and fragmenting systems of planetesimals or moonlets orbiting a central mass. It features a fragmentation model, based on crater scaling and ejecta models, able to realistically simulate a violent impact. The user of Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N can choose between four different built-in modules to compute self-gravity and detect collisions. One of these makes use of a mesh-based algorithm to treat mutual interactions in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time. Another module, much more efficient than the standard Barnes-Hut tree code, is a $\mathcal{O}(N)$ tree-based algorithm called FalcON. It relies on fast multipole expansion for gravity computation and we adapted it to collision detection as well. Computation time is reduced by building the tree structure using a three-dimensional Hilbert curve. For the same precision in mutual gravity computation, Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is found to be up to 25 times faster than the famous software REBOUND. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is written entirely in the C language and only needs a C compiler to run. A python add-on, that requires only basic python libraries, produces animations of the simulations from the output files. The name Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N, reminding of a scorpion, comes from the French $N$-corps, meaning $N$-body, and from the mathematical notation $\mathcal{O}(N)$, due to the running time of the software being almost linear in the total number $N$ of moonlets. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is designed for the study of accreting or fragmenting disks of planetesimal or moonlets. It detects collisions and computes mutual gravity faster than REBOUND, and unlike other $N$-body integrators, it can resolve a collision by fragmentation. The fast multipole expansions are implemented up to order six to allow for a high precision in mutual gravity computation.</description>

      <title>Can the giant planets of the Solar System form via pebble accretion in a smooth protoplanetary disc?</title>

Abstract: Prevailing $N$-body planet formation models typically start with lunar-mass embryos and show a general trend of rapid migration of massive planetary cores to the inner Solar System in the absence of a migration trap. This setup cannot capture the evolution from a planetesimal to embryo, which is crucial to the final architecture of the system. We aim to model planet formation with planet migration starting with planetesimals of $\sim10^{-6}$ -- $10^{-4}M_\oplus$ and reproduce the giant planets of the Solar System. We simulated a population of 1,000 -- 5,000 planetesimals in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which was evolved under the effects of their mutual gravity, pebble accretion, gas accretion, and planet migration, employing the parallelized $N$-body code SyMBAp. We find that the dynamical interactions among growing planetesimals are vigorous and can halt pebble accretion for excited bodies. While a set of results without planet migration produces one to two gas giants and one to two ice giants beyond 6 au, massive planetary cores readily move to the inner Solar System once planet migration is in effect. Dynamical heating is important in a planetesimal disc and the reduced pebble encounter time should be considered in similar models. Planet migration remains a challenge to form cold giant planets in a smooth protoplanetary disc, which suggests an alternative mechanism is required to stop them at wide orbits.</description>

      <title>Examining the detectability of ringing on highly eccentric exoplanets</title>

Abstract: Eccentric exoplanets offer an opportunity to study the response of an atmosphere to changing thermal forcing and the robustness of the super-rotating equatorial jet seen on tidally locked hot Jupiters. However, the atmospheric dynamics on eccentric planets strongly depend on the planetary rotation period, which is difficult to constrain observationally. The ringing phenomenon, whereby the observed emission increases and decreases after the periastron passage as the flash-heated hemisphere rotates into and out of view, can provide a tight constraint on rotation. We studied five highly eccentric transiting exoplanets HAT-P-2 b, HD 80606 b, TOI-3362 b, TOI-4127 b and HD 17156 b to find which displays strong ringing signals that are sufficiently strong for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to detect. We implemented the treatment of eccentricity and non-synchronous rotation in the non-grey climate model expeRT/MITgcm and generated synthetic light curves. We find four detectable ringing peaks on HD 80606 b and some undetectable ringing on TOI-4127 b and HD 17156 b. The lack of clouds, photo-chemistry and obliquity in our models may have led us to overestimate the amplitude of the ringing however. The strength of the ringing signal is mostly determined by the eccentricity, planetary rotation period, planet-to-star radius ratio and apparent magnitude of the system. We searched for more exoplanets that could show ringing but found no candidates as promising as HD 80606 b. We recommend prioritising HD 80606 b as a target for ringing with JWST. A baseline of five days after the periastron passage would capture three ringing peaks, which is sufficient to tightly constrain the planetary rotation period. An extension to seven days would add a fourth peak, which would allow us to verify the rotation period.</description>

      <title>Do Temperate Rocky Planets Around M Dwarfs have an Atmosphere ?</title>

Abstract: Detecting an atmosphere on nearby temperate planets is one of the most important scientific objectives of the Webb mission, an endeavour in practice limited to a handful of well-characterized planets: Trappist-1d, e, f, g, LHS1140b, and the mini-Neptune K2- 18b. The first 18 months of atmospheric characterization with JWST have confirmed both its power and versatility to probe exoplanet atmospheres, and have highlighted the challenge of stellar activity in studying those atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. Assessing the prevalence of atmosphere in temperate planets with a minimal degree of confidence will require a multi-cycle program of order of a few 1000 hours involving both eclipse photometry and transmission spectroscopy, a program that would have to be executed over a significant fraction of JWST's lifetime. Implementing specialized fast readout modes tailored for time-series observations of relatively bright stars would greatly enhance the efficiency and productivity of JWST's exoplanet science programs. The forthcoming 500 hours of Cycle 3 Director Discretionary Time dedicated to exoplanet programs represent a unique opportunity to initiate a deep reconnaissance of habitability of the best keystone temperate planets.</description>

      <title>Biogenic sulfur gases as biosignatures on temperate sub-Neptune waterworlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions and observational data indicate a class of sub-Neptune exoplanets may have water-rich interiors covered by hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Provided suitable climate conditions, such planets could host surface liquid oceans. Motivated by recent JWST observations of K2-18 b, we self-consistently model the photochemistry and potential detectability of biogenic sulfur gases in the atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptune waterworlds for the first time. On Earth today, organic sulfur compounds produced by marine biota are rapidly destroyed by photochemical processes before they can accumulate to significant levels. Domagal-Goldman et al. (2011) suggest that detectable biogenic sulfur signatures could emerge in Archean-like atmospheres with higher biological production or low UV flux. In this study, we explore biogenic sulfur across a wide range of biological fluxes and stellar UV environments. Critically, the main photochemical sinks are absent on the nightside of tidally locked planets. To address this, we further perform experiments with a 3D GCM and a 2D photochemical model (VULCAN 2D (Tsai et al. 2024)) to simulate the global distribution of biogenic gases to investigate their terminator concentrations as seen via transmission spectroscopy. Our models indicate that biogenic sulfur gases can rise to potentially detectable levels on hydrogen-rich waterworlds, but only for enhanced global biosulfur flux ($\gtrsim$20 times modern Earth's flux). We find that it is challenging to identify DMS at 3.4 $\mu m$ where it strongly overlaps with CH$_4$, whereas it is more plausible to detect DMS and companion byproducts, ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) and ethane (C$_2$H$_6$), in the mid-infrared between 9 and 13 $\mu m$.</description>
