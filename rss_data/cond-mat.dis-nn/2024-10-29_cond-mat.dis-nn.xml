      <title>Thermal cycling -- evidence for a generalized tunneling model and a tool to distinguish noise sources in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural two level systems (TLSs) ubiquitous in amorphous solids are dramatically sensitive to thermal cycling to about $20$K and then back to low temperature, a process upon which the excitation energy of most TLSs is significantly changed. Using Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not contained within the standard tunneling model, but is well explained by a model that includes an additional set of TLSs that are pseudo-gapped at low energies, yet possess strong strain interaction through which they generate significant dynamical disorder upon thermal cycling. Our results give support for the general applicability of the Two-TLS model to amorphous solids at low temperatures, in that nearing our understanding of the low-temperature universality of phonon attenuation in amorphous solids. Further, we suggest thermal cycling as a unique protocol to distinguish TLS noise from other noise sources in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Critical Droplets and Replica Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the notion of critical droplets is central to an understanding of the nature of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising model of a spin glass in arbitrary dimension. Given a specific ground state, suppose the coupling value for a given edge is varied with all other couplings held fixed. Beyond some specific value of the coupling, a droplet will flip leading to a new ground state; we refer to this as the critical droplet for that edge and ground state. We show that the distribution of sizes and energies over all edges for a specific ground state can be used to determine which of the leading scenarios for the spin glass phase is correct. In particular, the existence of low-energy interfaces between incongruent ground states as predicted by replica symmetry breaking is equivalent to the presence of critical droplets whose boundaries comprise a positive fraction of edges in the infinite lattice.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Raman Spectrum Calculations in Defective 2D Materials using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning prediction workflow to study the impact of defects on the Raman response of 2D materials. By combining the use of machine-learned interatomic potentials, the Raman-active $\Gamma$-weighted density of states method and splitting configurations in independant patches, we are able to reach simulation sizes in the tens of thousands of atoms, with diagonalization now being the main bottleneck of the simulation. We apply the method to two systems, isotopic graphene and defective hexagonal boron nitride, and compare our predicted Raman response to experimental results, with good agreement. Our method opens up many possibilities for future studies of Raman response in solid-state physics.</description>

      <title>Crystal melting influenced by particle cooperativity of the liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a universal relation between the thermal expansion coefficient of glasses $\alpha_g$, their glass-transition temperature Tg, and the so-called fragility index m of the corresponding supercooled liquid state was found to be valid for more than 200 glass formers, namely $\alpha_g/m\propto 1/T_g$ [P. Lunkenheimer et al., Nat. Phys. 19, 694 (2023)]. Here we show that this could also have far-reaching consequences for our understanding of crystal melting. Namely, when considering the empirically founded 2/3-rule, stating that the ratio of Tg and the melting temperature Tm is about 2/3 for almost all materials, for crystals a similar relation, $\alpha_c/m\propto 1/T_m$, should apply. Indeed, we find that the available experimental data are well consistent with such a relation. This implies that the melting of a crystal into an ordinary (non-supercooled) liquid is influenced by the fragility, a property quantifying the non-Arrhenius dynamics in the supercooled-liquid state of the material. We argue that this can be explained by a significant enhancement of the "ideal" (non-cooperative) melting temperature arising from the cooperativity of the particle motion in the liquid state above Tm. Therefore, a reassessment of the currently widely accepted microscopic understanding of crystal melting, still founded on the general ideas that lead to the time-honored Lindemann melting criterion, may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Injectivity capacity of ReLU gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the injectivity property of the ReLU networks layers. Determining the ReLU injectivity capacity (ratio of the number of layer's inputs and outputs) is established as isomorphic to determining the capacity of the so-called $\ell_0$ spherical perceptron. Employing \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) a powerful program is developed and utilized to handle the $\ell_0$ spherical perceptron and implicitly the ReLU layers injectivity. To put the entire fl RDT machinery in practical use, a sizeable set of numerical evaluations is conducted as well. The lifting mechanism is observed to converge remarkably fast with relative corrections in the estimated quantities not exceeding $\sim 0.1\%$ already on the third level of lifting. Closed form explicit analytical relations among key lifting parameters are uncovered as well. In addition to being of incredible importance in handling all the required numerical work, these relations also shed a new light on beautiful parametric interconnections within the lifting structure. Finally, the obtained results are also shown to fairly closely match the replica predictions from [40].</description>

      <title>Temporal localization of optical waves supported by a copropagating quasiperiodic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on time crystals concerns the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in time, as well as the realization of phenomena and phases known from solid-state physics in the time domain. Periodically driven systems of massive particles are widely used in these studies. In the present work, we consider a photonic system and demonstrate that stable nonlinear propagation of a strong optical wave in a fiber leads to the establishment of quasi-periodic oscillations in the electromagnetic field intensity. A second, weaker signal optical wave propagating in the fiber senses these oscillations and, as a result, undergoes exponential localization in time. This is a temporal analogue of Aubry-Andre localization. If an optical detector is placed at a certain position in the fiber, the temporal localization of the probe wave will be observed in the form of the signal which emerges and then decays as a function of time.</description>

      <title>On learning higher-order cumulants in diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyse how diffusion models learn correlations beyond Gaussian ones, we study the behaviour of higher-order cumulants, or connected n-point functions, under both the forward and backward process. We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Long-range hopping in the quasi-periodic potential weakens the non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model characterized by power-law hoppings ($1/s^{a}$) and a quasi-periodic parameter $\beta$, where $a$ denotes the power-law index, $s$ represents the hopping distance, and $\beta$ belongs to the metallic mean family. In the intermediate phases, we find that ergodic states correspond to complex eigenvalues, multifractal states to real eigenvalues, and localized states may exhibit either complex or real eigenvalues. Moreover, both real and complex energy spectra emerge in the localized phase, with real spectra attributed to pseudo-Hermiticity. Under open boundary conditions, our analysis of fractal dimensions and eigenstates reveals that all ergodic states transform into skin states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long-range hoppings weaken the skin effect, offering a new perspective for exploring non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Stress-Structure Self-Organization in Granular Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During quasi-static dynamics of granular systems, the stress and structure self-organise, but there is currently no quantitative measure or understanding of this phenomenon. Such an understanding is essential because local structural properties of the settled material are then correlated with the local stress, which calls into question existing linear theories of stress transmission in granular media. A method to quantify the local stress-structure correlations is necessary for addressing this issue and we present here such a method for planar systems. We then use it to analyze numerically several different systems, compressed quasi-statically by two different procedures. We define cells, cell orders, cell orientations, and cell stresses and report the following results. 1. Cells orient along the local stress major principal axes. 2. The mean ratio of cell principal stresses decreases with cell order and increases with friction. 3. The ratio distributions collapse onto a single curve under a simple scaling, for all packing protocols and friction coefficients. 4. A constructed model explains the correlations between the local cell and stress principal axis orientations. 5. The collapse of the stress ratios onto a Weibull distribution is explained theoretically. Our results quantify the cooperative stress-structure self-organization and provide a way to relate quantitatively the stress-structure coupling to different process parameters and particle characteristics. Significantly, the strong stress-structure correlation, driven by structural re-organization upon application of external stress, suggests that current stress theories of granular matter need to be revisited.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Characterization of Labyrinthine Pattern Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive approach to characterizing labyrinthine structures that often emerge as a final steady state in pattern forming systems. We employ advanced machine learning based pattern recognition techniques to identify the types and locations of topological defects of the local stripe ordering. Applying this method to single-crystal Bi-substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet films, we uncover a distinct morphological transition between two zero-field labyrinthine structures. Crucially, the pair distribution functions of the topological defects reveal subtle differences between labyrinthine structures which are beyond conventional characterization methods. By systematically analyzing the spatial correlations and geometric properties of these defects, we provide new insights into the athermal dynamics governing the observed morphological transitions. Our work demonstrates that machine learning based recognition techniques enable novel studies of rich and complex labyrinthine type structures universal to many pattern formation systems.</description>

      <title>Fractal Surface States in Three-Dimensional Topological Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological states of matter in quasicrystals, which do not rely on crystalline orders. In the absence of a bandstructure description and spin-orbit coupling, we show that a three-dimensional quasicrystal can nevertheless form a topological insulator. It relies on a combination of noncrystallographic rotational symmetry of quasicrystals and electronic orbital space symmetry, which is the quasicrystalline counterpart of topological crystalline insulator. The resulting topological state obeys a non-trivial twisted bulk-boundary correspondence and lacks a good metallic surface. The topological surface states, localized on the top and bottom planes respecting the quasicrystalline symmetry, exhibit a new kind of multifractality with probability density concentrates mostly on high symmetry patches. They form a near-degenerate manifold of 'immobile' states whose number scales proportionally with the macroscopic sample size. This can open the door to a novel platform for topological surface physics distinct from the crystalline counterpart.</description>

      <title>Kondo Impurities at a Finite Concentration of Impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the Kondo impurity problem - at a finite concentration of impurities. We identify two parameter regimes for the Kondo impurity problem. 1) The single impurity limit, where the concentration of Kondo impurities is so low that the background scattering mechanisms (non-magnetic impurities, Umklapp scattering, etc.) of the metal considered are the dominant conduction electron scattering mechanisms at zero temperature. 2) The dilute impurity system limit where the concentration of magnetic impurities is such that they form the dominant mechanism of conduction electron scattering at zero temperature of the metal in question (this is accompanied by a variety of easily detectable Kondo signatures (resistance minimum, specific heat measurements, magnetization as a function of external magnetic field, conduction electron dephasing rates as well as ARPES, RIXS and NMR spectroscopies)) while still being very dilute. Most theoretical efforts are currently in regime where a single isolated impurity is considered - regime 1) while most experimental efforts are in regime 2). We present analytical evidence that this explains the well known discrepancy between experiment and theory as to the value of the Kondo temperature. We find that the ratio between the two Kondo temperatures in regime 1) and regime 2) is given by: $\mathcal{R}=\exp\left[\frac{\pi^{2}\rho v_{F}}{2k_{F}^{2}Vol}\right]$ where $\rho$ is the density of states, $v_{F}$ is the fermi velocity, and $k_{F}$ is the Fermi wavevector and $Vol$ is the volume of a unit cell. We note that there is no dependence on the impurity concentration in this ratio so it is possible to define a single Kondo temperature for limit 2) for the dilute Kondo impurity system. In this work we present results within the Reed-Newns Kondo meanfield approximation and to leading order of the linked cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of elementary excitations in disordered binary Bose mixtures: Effects of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the Anderson localization of quasiparticles in binary Bose mixtures in the presence of the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum and thermal corrections subjected to correlated disordered potentials. We calculate the density profiles, the Bogoliubov quasiparticles modes, and the localization length in both the mixture and droplet phases. We show that for one-dimensional speckle potentials, the peculiar interplay of disorder and the Lee-Huang-Yang fluctuations may enhance localization in one component while inducing delocalization in the other. Our results reveal also that thermal fluctuations lead to the emergence of two and multiple localization maxima. In the droplet state, our findings uncover that the Anderson localization of quasiparticles is weak in the flat-top region since its excitation modes are restricted to those below the particle-emission threshold.</description>
