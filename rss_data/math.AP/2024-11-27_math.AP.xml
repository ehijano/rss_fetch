      <title>Stability analysis of hyperbolic-parabolic free boundary problems modelling biofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the stability analysis of two free boundary problems arising in biofilm modelling. The first, introduced in the 1980s by Wanner and Gujer, is related to the competition between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in a biofilm bioreactor. It is a free boundary problem consisting of a system of hyperbolic PDEs modelling biofilm growth and the competition between species, a parabolic system accounting for substrate consumption, and an ODE for biofilm thickness.
  The second, also based on the former, arises from the modelling of trace-metal precipitation in biofilms, with a special focus on the role of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the methane production process.
  The analysis is made into two steps, the first one being the existence and uniqueness of the stationary solutions. The second one allows to show that the calssical solutions converge to the stationary solutions by using a semigroup approach and the energy method.
  We also extend the study to the precipitation model, in which the substrates are modelled by a parabolic system with variable diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of isothermal rarefied gas flows in an infinite layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let rarefied gas be confined in an infinite layer with diffusely reflecting boundaries that are isothermal and non-moving. The initial-boundary value problem on the nonlinear Boltzmann equation governing the rarefied gas flow in such setting is challenging due to unboundedness of both domain and its boundaries as well as the presence of physical boundary conditions. In the paper, we establish the global-in-time dynamics of such rarefied gas flows near global Maxwellians in three or two-dimensions. For the former case, we also prove that the solutions decay in time at a polynomial rate which is the same as that of solutions to the two-dimensional heat equation. This is the first result on global solutions of the Boltzmann equation with non-compact and diffuse boundaries.</description>

      <title>Reverse Riesz Inequality on Manifolds with Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our investigation, we focus on the reverse Riesz transform within the framework of manifolds with ends. Such manifolds can be described as the connected sum of finite number of Cartesian products $\mathbb{R}^{n_i} \times \mathcal{M}_i$, where $\mathcal{M}_i$ are compact manifolds. We rigorously establish the boundedness of this transform across all $L^p$ spaces for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Notably, existing knowledge indicates that the Riesz transform in such a context demonstrates boundedness solely within a specific range of $L^p$ spaces, typically observed for $1&lt;p&lt;n_*$, where $n_*$ signifies the smallest dimension of the manifold's ends on a large scale.
  This observation serves as a significant counterexample to the presumed equivalence between the Riesz and reverse Riesz transforms. Our study illuminates the nuanced behaviour of these transforms within the setting of manifolds with ends, providing valuable insights into their distinct properties. Although the lack of equivalence has been previously noted in relevant literature, our investigation contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between the Riesz and reverse Riesz transforms.</description>

      <title>Removing singularities for fully nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17133v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show removability of half-line singularities for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic PDEs which have classical density and a Jacobi inequality. An example of such a PDE is the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, and the original proof follows from Caffarelli 1990. Other examples are the minimal surface and special Lagrangian equations. The present paper's quick doubling proof combines Savin's small perturbation theorem with the Jacobi inequality. The method more generally removes singularities satisfying the single side condition.</description>

      <title>Critical local well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local well-posedness of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on tori $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ at the critical regularity. We focus on cases where the nonlinearity $|u|^{a}u$ is non-algebraic with small $a&gt;0$. We prove the local well-posedness for a wide range covering the mass-supercritical regime. Moreover, we supplementarily investigate the regularity of the solution map. In pursuit of lowering $a$, we prove a bilinear estimate for the Schr\"odinger operator on tori $\mathbb{T}^{d}$, which enhances previously known multilinear estimates. We design a function space adapted to the new bilinear estimate and a package of Strichartz estimates, which is not based on conventional atomic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the random attractors associated with the stochastic fractional Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Utilizing the stochastic Strichartz estimates for the damped fractional Schr\"odinger equation with Gaussian noise, we show the existence and uniqueness of a global solution to the damped stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in $H^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this equation defines an infinite-dimensional dynamical system, which possesses a global attractor in $H^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.</description>

      <title>Physical Vacuum Problems for the Full Compressible Euler Equations: Hadamard-style Local Well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript addresses the local well-posedness theories for the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish Hadamard-style local well-posedness within suitable weighted Sobolev spaces, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we provide a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria. These results are applicable to the low-regularity solutions, in the sense that, the pointwise regularities of the free boundaries and the velocity fields restricted to them could merely be $C^{1.5+}$ and $C^{1+}$, respectively.
  This is the first well-posedness result for the full compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum for space dimensions not restricted to one. The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior of exponential surface diffusion flows on $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a surface diffusion flow of the form $V=\partial_s^2f(-\kappa)$ with a strictly increasing smooth function $f$ typically, $f(r)=e^r$, for a curve with arc-length parameter $s$, where $\kappa$ denotes the curvature and $V$ denotes the normal velocity. The conventional surface diffusion flow corresponds to the case when $f(r)=r$. We consider this equation for the graph of a function defined on the whole real line $\mathbb{R}$. We prove that there exists a unique global-in-time classical solution provided that the first and the second derivatives are bounded and small. We further prove that the solution behaves like a solution to a self-similar solution to the equation $V=-f'(0)\kappa$. Our result justifies the explanation for grooving modeled by Mullins (1957) directly obtained by Gibbs--Thomson law without linearization of $f$ near $\kappa=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the energy per particle on the lattice given by $\min_{ \Lambda }\sum_{ \mathbb{P}\in \Lambda} \left|\mathbb{P}\right|^4 e^{-\pi \alpha \left|\mathbb{P}\right|^2 }$, where $\alpha &gt;0$ and $\Lambda$ is a two dimensional lattice. We prove that for $\alpha\geq\frac{3}{2}$, among two dimensional lattices with unit density, such energy minimum is attained at $e^{i\frac{\pi}{3}}$, corresponding to the hexagonal lattice. Our result partially answers some open questions proposed by B\'etermin.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization approach for tracking the location and orientation of a moving target using far-field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse scattering problem for tracking the location and orientation of a moving scatterer using a single incident field. We solve the problem by adopting the optimization approach with the objective function defined by the discrepancy in far-field data. We rigorously derive formulas for the far-field data under translation and rotation of the target and prove that the objective function is locally Lipschitz with respect to the orientation angle at the true angle. By integrating these formulas with the Bayesian optimization approach, we reduce the cost of objective function evaluations. For the instance of an unknown target, machine learning via fully connected neural networks is applied to identify the shape of the target. Numerical simulations for randomly generated shapes and trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>The horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem was posed by Li and Xu (2022) as a problem prescribing the $k$-th horospherical $p$-surface area measure of $h$-convex domains in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$. It is a natural generalization of the classical $L^p$ Christoffel-Minkowski problem in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In this paper, we consider a fully nonlinear equation associated with the horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. We establish the existence of a uniformly $h$-convex solution under appropriate assumptions on the prescribed function. The key to the proof is the full rank theorem, which we will demonstrate using a viscosity approach based on the idea of Bryan-Ivaki-Scheuer (2023). When $p=0$, the horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ is equivalent to a Nirenberg-type problem on $\mathbb{S}^n$ in conformal geometry. Therefore, our result implies the existence of solutions to the Nirenberg-type problem.</description>

      <title>Schauder estimate for the boundary diffusion equaiton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a certain type of linear boundary diffusion equation is studied. Such equation is crucial in the research of a non-linear boundary diffusion problem which was originated from the boundary heat control problem and Yamabe flow. Such equation is also analogous to the classical fast diffusion equation and porous medium equation. Under an compatible energy condition and the help of two types of test functions, $C^{1+\alpha}$-type Schauder estimates of the solution to the linear boundary diffusion equation in local configuration are obtained, through iteration to integrals both on the interior and the boundary at the same time. As applications, Schauder estimates of a new $C^{1+\alpha}$-type solution to the related boundary diffusion equations are established, which eventually provide a proof of short time existence of this new type of solution with smooth positive initial data and inhomogeneous boundary term.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Poisson-Nernst-Planck cross-diffusion system with steric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transient Poisson-Nernst-Planck system with steric effects is analyzed in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions for the ion concentrations and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions for the electric potential. The steric repulsion of ions is modeled by a localized Lennard-Jones force, leading to cross-diffusion terms. The existence of global weak solutions, a weak--strong uniqueness property, and, in case of pure Neumann conditions, the exponential decay towards the thermal equilibrium state is proved. The main difficulties are the cross-diffusion terms and the different boundary conditions satisfied by the unknowns. These issues are overcome by exploiting the entropy structure of the equations and carefully taking into account the electric potential term. A numerical experiment illustrates the long-time behavior of the solutions when the potential satisfies mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear shell model is studied in this paper. This is a nonlinear variant of the Budiansky-Sanders linear shell model. Under some suitable assumptions on the magnitude of the applied force, we will prove the existence of a minimizer for this shell model. In addition, we will also show that our existence result can be applied to all kinds of geometries of the middle surface of the shell. We will also show that the minimizer found in this fashion is unique, provided the small enough applied force. Our result hence extends the one given by Destuynder in [1].</description>

      <title>Properties of the phase boundary in the parabolic problem with hysteresis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions of parabolic equations with a discontinuous hysteresis operator, described by a free interface boundary. It is established that for spatially transverse initial data from the space $W^{2-2/q}_q$ with $q &gt; 3$, there exists a solution in the space $W^{2,1}_q$, where the interface boundary exhibits Holder continuity with an exponent $1/2$. Furthermore for initial data from the space $W^2_\infty$, it is proven that the interface boundary satisfies the Lipschitz condition. It is shown that for non-transversal initial data, solutions with an interface boundary do not exist.</description>

      <title>Universality of renormalisable mappings in two dimensions: the case of polar convex integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish universality of the renormalised energy for mappings from a planar domain to a compact manifold, by approximating subquadratic polar convex functionals of the form $\int_\Omega f(|\mathrm{D} u|)\,\mathrm{d} x$. The analysis relies on the condition that the vortex map ${x}/{\lvert x\rvert}$ has finite energy and that $t\mapsto f (\sqrt{t})$ is concave. We derive the leading order asymptotics and provide a detailed description of the convergence of $\mathrm{W}^{1,1}$-almost minimisers, leading to a characterization of second-order asymptotics. At the core of the method, we prove a ball merging construction (following Jerrard and Sandier's approach) for a general class of convex integrands. We therefore generalize the approximation by $p$-harmonic mappings when $p\nearrow 2$ and can also cover linearly growing functionals, including those of area-type.</description>

      <title>Structural identifiability of linear-in-parameter parabolic PDEs through auxiliary elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter identifiability is often requisite to the effective application of mathematical models in the interpretation of biological data, however theory applicable to the study of partial differential equations remains limited. We present a new approach to structural identifiability analysis of fully observed parabolic equations that are linear in their parameters. Our approach frames identifiability as an existence and uniqueness problem in a closely related elliptic equation and draws, for homogeneous equations, on the well-known Fredholm alternative to establish unconditional identifiability, and cases where specific choices of initial and boundary conditions lead to non-identifiability. While in some sense pathological, we demonstrate that this loss of structural identifiability has ramifications for practical identifiability; important particularly for spatial problems, where the initial condition is often limited by experimental constraints. For cases with nonlinear reaction terms, uniqueness of solutions to the auxiliary elliptic equation corresponds to identifiability, often leading to unconditional global identifiability under mild assumptions. We present analysis for a suite of simple scalar models with various boundary conditions that include linear (exponential) and nonlinear (logistic) source terms, and a special case of a two-species cell motility model. We conclude by discussing how this new perspective enables well-developed analysis tools to advance the developing theory underlying structural identifiability of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet problems and Hardy spaces for singular Schr\"odinger equations with block structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Riesz transform bounds and characterise operator-adapted Hardy spaces to solve boundary value problems for singular Schr\"odinger equations $-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)+aVu=0$ in the upper half-space $\mathbb{R}^{1+n}_{+}$ with boundary dimension $n\geq 3$. The coefficients $(A,a,V)$ are assumed to be independent of the transversal direction to the boundary, and consist of a complex-elliptic pair $(A,a)$ that is bounded and measurable with a certain block structure, and a non-negative singular potential $V$ in the reverse H\"older class $\mathrm{RH}^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for $q\geq \max\{\frac{n}{2},2\}$. We find extrapolation intervals for exponents $p$ around $2$ on which the Dirichlet problem is well-posed for boundary data in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, and the associated Regularity problem is well-posed for boundary data in Sobolev spaces $\dot{\mathcal{V}}^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ that are adapted to the potential $V$, when $p&gt;1$. The results permit boundary data in the Dziuba\`{n}ski--Zienkiewicz Hardy space $\mathrm{H}^{1}_{V}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and adapted Hardy--Sobolev spaces $\dot{\mathrm{H}}^{1,p}_{V}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ when $p\leq 1$. We also obtain comparability of square functions and nontangential maximal functions for the solutions with their boundary data.</description>

      <title>Minimally singular functions and the rigidity problem for Steiner's perimeter inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 1$, and let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be an open and connected set with finite Lebesgue measure. Among functions of bounded variation in $\Omega$ we introduce the class of \emph{minimally singular} functions. Inspired by the original theory of Vol'pert of one-dimensional restrictions of $BV$ functions, we provide a geometric characterization for this class of functions via the introduction of a pseudometric that we call \emph{singular vertical distance}. As an application, we present a characterization result for \emph{rigidity} of equality cases for Steiner's perimeter inequality. By \emph{rigidity} we mean that the only extremals for Steiner's perimeter inequality are vertical translations of the Steiner symmetric set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete the classification of semigraphical translators for mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that was initiated by Hoffman-Mart\'in-White. Specifically, we show that there is no solution to the translator equation on the upper half-plane with alternating positive and negative infinite boundary values, and we prove the uniqueness of pitchfork and helicoid translators. The proofs use Morse-Rad\'o theory for translators and an angular maximum principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove eigenvalue bounds for Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta_g+V$ on compact manifolds with complex potentials $V$. The bounds depend only on an $L^q$-norm of the potential, and they are shown to be optimal, in a certain sense, on the round sphere and more general Zoll manifolds. These bounds are natural analogues of Frank's \cite{MR2820160} results in the Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: The $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem and the prescribed $L_p$-Weingarten curvature problem for convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space are important problems in geometric analysis. In this paper, we consider their counterparts in hyperbolic space. For the horospherical $p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem first introduced and studied by the second and third authors, we prove the existence of smooth, origin-symmetric, strictly horospherically convex solutions by establishing a new full rank theorem. We also propose the prescribed $p$-shifted Weingarten curvature problem and prove an existence result.</description>

      <title>On turbulence for spacetimes with stable trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of spacetimes admitting stably trapped null geodesics, such as ultracompact objects and black string solutions to general relativity, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear scalar waves on a simple (fixed) model geometry with stable trapping. More specifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the cubic (defocusing) wave equation on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon sphere.
  Our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar dynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of solutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously proven to remain uniformly bounded and to decay uniformly in time. However, due to the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help elucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave equation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting to axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics, we exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with turbulent behaviour: Within the region of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order energies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we numerically evolve, with the growth being induced by a direct energy cascade.
  As a complement to the numerical analysis, we provide a heuristic argument suggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave perturbations of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity, it would likely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.</description>

Abstract: A scheme for generating weakly lower semi-continuous action functionals corresponding to the Euler-Lagrange equations of Chern-Simons theory is described. Coercivity is deduced for such a functional in appropriate function spaces to prove the existence of a minimizer, which constitutes a solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations of Chern-Simons theory in a relaxed sense. A geometric analysis is also made, especially for the gauge group SU(2), relating connection forms on the bundle to corresponding forms in the dual scheme.</description>

Moreover, if the homology class $\tau$ is representable by a smooth submanifold, then $\Sigma$ can be chosen free of singularities.</description>

      <title>Optimal relaxation of bump-like solutions of the one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.14004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: REVISED VERSION INCORPORATING THE ERRATUM ON LEMMA 2.1 AND WITH A CORRECTION TO LEMMA 2.8
  In this paper we derive optimal relaxation rates for the Cahn-Hilliard equation on the one-dimensional torus and the line. We consider initial conditions with a finite (but not small) $L^1$-distance to an appropriately defined bump. The result extends the relaxation method developed previously for a single transition layer (the ``kink'') to the case of two transition layers (the ``bump''). As in the previous work, the tools include Nash-type inequalities, duality arguments, and Schauder estimates. For both the kink and the bump, the energy gap is translation invariant and its decay alone cannot specify to which member of the family of minimizers the solution converges. Whereas in the case of the kink, the conserved quantity singles out the longtime limit, in the case of a bump, a new argument is needed. On the torus, we quantify the (initially algebraic and ultimately exponential) convergence to the bump that is the longtime limit; on the line, the bump-like states are merely metastable and we quantify the initial algebraic relaxation behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the homogenization of stationary and evolutionary incompressible viscous non-Newtonian flows of Carreau-Yasuda type in domains perforated with a large number of periodically distributed small holes in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the mutual distance between the holes is measured by a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and the size of the holes is $\varepsilon^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, \frac 32)$. The Darcy's law is recovered in the limit, thus generalizing the results from [\url{https://doi.org/10.1016/0362-546X(94)00285-P}] and [\url{https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.05121}] for $\alpha=1$. Instead of using their restriction operator to derive the estimates of the pressure extension by duality, we use the Bogovski\u{\i} type operator in perforated domains (constructed in [\url{https://doi.org/10.1051/cocv/2016016}]) to deduce the uniform estimates of the pressure directly. Moreover, quantitative convergence rates are given.</description>

Abstract: We develop the time-dependent regularized 13-moment equations for general elastic collision models under the linear regime. Detailed derivation shows the proposed equations have super-Burnett order for small Knudsen numbers, and the moment equations enjoy a symmetric structure. A new modification of Onsager boundary conditions is proposed to ensure stability as well as the removal of undesired boundary layers. Numerical examples of one-dimensional channel flows is conducted to verified our model.</description>

      <title>Unified quantitative analysis of the Stokes equations in dilute perforated domains via layer potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified method to obtain the quantitative homogenization of Stokes systems in periodically perforated domains with no-slip boundary conditions on the perforating holes. The main novelty of our paper is a quantitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the two-scale cell correctors via periodic Stokes layer potentials. The two-scale cell correctors were introduced and analyzed qualitatively by Allaire in the early 90's. Thanks to our layer potential approach, we also provide a novel explanation of the conductivity matrix in Darcy's model, of the Brinkman term in Brinkman's model, and explain the special behavior for $d=2$. Finally, we also prove quantitative homogenization error estimates in various regimes of ratios between the size of the perforating holes and the typical distance between holes. In particular we handle a subtle issue in the dilute Darcy regime related to the non-vanishing of the Darcy velocity on the boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional boundary blow up problems with Kirchhoff type nonlocal terms on an interval. We perform a bifurcation analysis on the problems and obtain the precise number of solutions according to the value of the bifurcation parameter. We also obtain the precise asymptotic formula for solutions for special cases.</description>

      <title>Nodal sets and continuity of eigenfunctions of Kre\u{\i}-Feller operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a compactly supported positive finite Borel measure on $\R^{d}$. Let $0&lt;\lambda_{1}\leq\lambda_{2}\leq\ldots$ be eigenvalues of the Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operator $\Delta_{\mu}$. We prove that, on a bounded domain, the nodal set of a continuous $\lambda_{n}$-eigenfunction of a Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operator divides the domain into at least 2 and at most $n+r-1$ subdomains, where $r$ is the multiplicity of $\lambda_{n}$. This work generalizes the nodal set theorem of the classical Laplace operator to Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operators on bounded domains. We also prove that on bounded domains on which the classical Green function exists, the eigenfunctions of a Kre$\breve{{\i}}$n-Feller operator are continuous.</description>

      <title>On Temporal Decay of Compressible Hookean Viscoelastic Fluids with Relatively Large Elasticity Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Jiang--Jiang (J. Differential Equations 282, 2021) showed the existence of unique strong solutions in spatial periodic domain (denoted by $\mathbb{T}^3$), whenever the elasticity coefficient is larger than the initial velocity perturbation of the rest state. Motivated by Jiang--Jiang's result, we revisit the Cauchy problem of the compressible viscoelastic fluids in Lagrangian coordinates. Employing an energy method with temporal weights and an additional asymptotic stability condition of initial density in Lagrangian coordinates, we extend the Jiang--Jiang's result with exponential decay-in-time in $\mathbb{T}^3$ to the one with algebraic decay-in-time in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Thanks to the algebraic decay of solutions established by the energy method with temporal weights, we can further use the spectral analysis to improve the temporal decay rate of solutions. In particular, we find that the $k$-th order spatial derivatives of both the density and deformation perturbations converge to zero in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ at a rate of $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k+1}{2}}$, which is faster than the decay rate $(1 +t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ obtained by Hu--Wu (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 45, 2013) for $k=0$ and $ 1$. In addition, it's well-known that the decay rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ of the density perturbation is optimal in the compressible Navier--Stokes equations (A.~Matsumura, T.~Nishida, Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser-A. 55, 1979). Therefore, our faster temporal decay rates indicate that the elasticity accelerates the decay of the density perturbation after the rest state of a compressible viscoelastic fluid being perturbed.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the translating solitons of fully nonlinear extrinsic curvature geometric flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We present a generalization of the Spruck-Xiao's and Spruck-Sun's convexity results for $1$-homogeneous convex/concave curvature functions, and further provide several characterizations of the family of grim reaper cylinders under curvature constraints.</description>

      <title>Prescribing curvatures in the disk via conformal changes of the metric: the case of negative Gaussian curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the question of prescribing the Gaussian curvature on a disk and the geodesic curvature of its boundary by means of a conformal deformation of the metric. We restrict ourselves to a symmetric setting in which the Gaussian curvature is negative, and we are able to give general existence results. Our approach is variational, and solutions will be searched as critical points of an associated functional. The proofs use a perturbation argument via the monotonicity trick of Struwe, together with a blow-up analysis and Morse index estimates. We also give a nonexistence result that shows that, to some extent, the assumptions required for existence are necessary.</description>

      <title>A reverse Faber-Krahn inequality for the magnetic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured by S. Fournais and B. Helffer, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scattering Theory for Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Solutions in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at the spacelike asymptotic boundaries $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+.$ The case of even spatial dimension $n$ poses significant challenges compared to its odd counterpart and was left open by the previous works in the literature. Here, scattering theory is understood to mean existence and uniqueness of scattering states, asymptotic completeness, and the existence of an invertible scattering map with quantitative control on its norm. The existence and uniqueness of scattering states imply that for any small asymptotic data there exists a unique global solution to the Einstein equations, which remains close to the de Sitter metric. Asymptotic completeness is the converse statement, showing that any such solution induces asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and at $\mathscr{I}^+.$ For sufficiently small asymptotic data, we construct the scattering map $\mathscr{S}$ taking data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to data at $\mathscr{I}^+,$ and we show that the map $\mathscr{S}$ is locally invertible and locally Lipschitz at the de Sitter data, with respect to a Sobolev-type norm.
  The scattering map result is sharp and avoids any "derivative loss", in the sense that we measure the smallness of asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ using the same Sobolev norm. The proof of the sharp result requires a detailed analysis of the Einstein equations involving a geometric Littlewood-Paley decomposition of the solution, carried out in our companion paper.</description>
