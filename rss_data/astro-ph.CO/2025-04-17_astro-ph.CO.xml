      <title>Damping Wing-Like Features in the Spectra of High Redshift Quasars: a Challenge for Fully-Coupled Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several observational detections of damping-wing-like features at the edges of ``dark gaps" in the spectra of distant quasars (the ``Malloy-Lidz effect") have been reported, rendering strong support for the existence of ``neutral islands" in the universe at redshifts as low as $z&lt;5.5$. We apply the procedure from one of these works, \citet{YZhu2024}, to the outputs of fully coupled cosmological simulations from two recent large projects, ``Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and ``Thesan". Synthetic spectra in both simulations have statistics of dark gaps similar to observations, but do not exhibit the damping wing features. Moreover, a toy model with neutral islands added ``by hand" only reproduces the observational results when the fraction of neutral islands among all dark gaps exceeds 90%. I.e., simulations and observations appear to produce two distinct ``populations" of dark gaps. In addition, the neutral islands observed at $z=5.9$ should be short-lived and hence cannot extend to $z&lt;5.5$. In summary, the observational detections of damping wing features present serious challenges not only to state-of-the-art simulations but also to our general understanding of how reionization should proceed.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Genesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of primordial black hole (PBH) candidates by means of high cadence microlensing open the way to a physical understanding of the formation of dark matter as a chapter in the thermal history of the Universe. Two complementary sites of PBH formation are considered, inflation and the early Universe at TeV to MeV energies. In the latter case the Friedman equation, together with the measurement of the mass of the PBH, reveal the threshold energy, the mass spectrum and the likely end point of this epoch. Some of the many recent exoplanet detections may conceivably have been detections of PBHs. When the Universe cools to MeV temperatures, larger mass PBH would form similarly, reaching the supermassive regime. The discovery of numerous supermassive black holes (SMBH) at high redshift with JWST fulfils this expectation. We corroborate the idea that Planck mass relics could be an important component of dark matter, and find that these are formed by PBH with initial mass less than approximately 6 x 10^{-16} M{_\odot} and cosmic temperature above 10^9 GeV. Although in some mass ranges PBH can only make up a modest fraction of {\Omega}matter, it is possible that all astrophysical dark matter, as distinct from axions and WIMPs, is of PBH origin.</description>

      <title>Fast Baryonic Field Painting for Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Analyses: Transfer Function vs. Hybrid Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two approaches for "painting" baryonic properties relevant to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect - optical depth and Compton-$y$ - onto 3-dimensional $N$-body simulations, using the MillenniumTNG suite as a benchmark. The goal of these methods is to produce fast and accurate reconstruction methods to aid future analyses of baryonic feedback using the SZ effect. The first approach employs a Gaussian Process emulator to model the SZ quantities via a transfer function, while the second utilizes Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) to reproduce these quantities within the simulation. Our analysis involves comparing both methods to the true MillenniumTNG optical depth and Compton-$y$ fields using several metrics, including the cross-correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and power spectrum error. Additionally, we assess how well the reconstructed fields correlate with dark matter haloes across various mass thresholds. The results indicate that the transfer function method yields more accurate reconstructions for fields with initially high correlations ($r \approx 1$), such as between the optical depth and dark matter fields. Conversely, the HEFT-based approach proves more effective in enhancing correlations for fields with weaker initial correlations ($r \sim 0.5$), such as between the Compton-$y$ and dark matter fields. Lastly, we discuss extensions of our methods to improve the reconstruction performance at the field level.</description>

      <title>Recovering the CMB signal with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Component separation is the process of extracting one or more emission sources in astrophysical maps. It is therefore crucial to develop models that can accurately clean the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in current and future experiments. In this work, we present a new methodology based on neural networks which operates on realistic temperature and polarization simulations. We assess its performance by comparing the power spectra of the output maps with those of the input maps and other emissions. For temperature, we obtain residuals of $20 \pm \mu K^{2}$. For polarization, we analyze the $E$ and $B$ modes, which are related to density (scalar) and primordial gravitational waves (tensorial) perturbations occurring in the first second of the Universe, obtaining residuals of $10^{-2} \mu K^{2}$ at $l&gt;200$ and $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3} \mu K^{2}$ for $E$ and $B$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Separate universe in multifield inflation: a phase-space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we extend a study of the validity conditions of the separate-universe approach of cosmological perturbations to models of inflation with multiple fields. The separate-universe approach consists in describing the universe as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches, giving us an effective description of perturbation theory at large scales through phase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic inflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields fluctuations. One needs a stochastic inflation description in the context of primordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature power spectrum. It easily achievable in multifield inflation models but necessarily comes with strong diffusive effects. We study and compare cosmological perturbation theory and the separate-universe approach in said non-linear sigma models as a typical framework of multifield inflation and employing the Hamiltonian formalism to keep track of the complete phase space (or the reduced isotropic phase space in the separate-universe approach). We find that the separate-universe approach adequately describes the cosmological perturbation theory provided the wavelength of the modes considered is greater that several lower bounds that depend on the cosmological horizon and the inverse of the effective Hamiltonian masses of the fields; the latter being fixed by the coupling potential and the field-space geometry. We also compare gauge-invariant variables and several gauge fixing procedures in both approaches. For instance, we showed that the uniform-expansion gauge is nicely described by the separate-universe picture, hence qualifying its use in stochastic inflation as commonly done.</description>

      <title>Probing the cold nature of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pressureless dark matter component fits well with several cosmological observations. However, there are indications that cold dark matter may encounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly at galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models incorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale problems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark matter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning into the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly increases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold dark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\rm de}$), and dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark energy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze interacting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these scenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their combination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our analyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot be excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets, there is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more than 95\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of state lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This study suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter component should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological implications, as reflected in the present work.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations in $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Can asteroid-mass PBHDM be compatible with catalyzed phase transition interpretation of PTA?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of this catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density regime. Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive the general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs. We find that at relatively small PBH number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the large-size bubbles. While higher PBH number densities suppress GW signals, since the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly. We further extend our findings to the bulk flow model and to scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) generated during PTs. By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters. Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals. However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter with Matter Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit wave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A particularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces variations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles becomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\,\text{eV}$, as traditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast, the matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space. These effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary matter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter induced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic scalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based on quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these phenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach not only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also covers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects, screening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one finding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the descreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident momentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss current and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests, equivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably, we go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraints on the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the decoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing the quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology in NANOGrav and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-singular matter bouncing cosmological setups are of particular interest since apart from adressing the initial singularity problem they can give rise as well to a nearly scale-invariant curvature power spectrum on scales $k&lt;10^{4}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, favored by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. Interestingly enough, one can find that within such non-singular bouncing cosmological setups, curvature perturbations grow on super-horizon scales during the matter contracting phase. In this work, we account for the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the transition to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, finding at the end naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales at horizon-crossing time during the expanding phase. These enhanced cosmological perturbations can induce gravitational waves (GWs) due to second order gravitational interactions and collapse as well to form primordial black holes (PBHs), with the latter acting as one of the most viable dark matter candidates. Remarkably, we find an induced GW background with a universal infrared (IR) frequency scaling of $f^2$, in excellent agreement with the recently released $\mathrm{nHz}$ GW data by the NANOGrav collaboration, being potentially detectable as well by other GW observatories such as LISA and ET, depending on the values of the bouncing cosmological parameters at hand.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy in black hole transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several reasons to support the idea that entropy might be associated to gravity itself. In the absence of a quantum theory of gravity, classical estimators for the gravitational entropy have been proposed. Any viable description of the gravitational entropy should reproduce the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy at the event horizon of black holes. Furthermore, in any black hole transformation, these estimators must satisfy the second law of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we analyze whether two entropy estimators, one based on the Weyl tensor and the other on the Bel-Robinson tensor, satisfy the second law in the transformation process from a Schwarzschild to a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole by the absorption of a charge test particle. We also address the inverse process. We show that depending whether the process is reversible or not, both estimators fulfill the second law.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Narrowband Imaging of a z=3.24 Protocluster: Insights from [O III] Emitting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a narrowband imaging on a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster ``D4UD01'' at z=3.24 using CFHT/WIRCam. We identify a sample of 24 [O III] emission line galaxies in the field, which forms a large overdensity in the protocluster region. The protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like cluster by z=0. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derive the physical properties of these [O III] emitters and find they are medium mass normal star-forming galaxies ($\sim10^{10}$M$_\odot$) roughly following the star-forming main sequence. The [O III] emitters trace an overdensity spatially offset from that of photometric-redshift and quiescent galaxies, suggesting these distinct galaxy populations may inhabit dark matter halos that formed at different epochs. A comparative analysis of [O III] emitter properties shows similar characteristics in both protocluster and field environments. This protocluster likely represents an evolved structure that has progressed beyond its peak star-formation phase, although our limited sample size may prevent detection of subtle environmental effects.</description>

      <title>Sound waves from primordial black hole formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave spectrum from associated sound waves.</description>

Abstract: Data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are discriminating between different models of inflation, disfavoring simple monomial potentials whilst being consistent with models whose predictions resemble those of the Starobinsky $R + R^2$ cosmological model. However, this model may suffer from theoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value, threatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of light states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be lower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation, leading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity models can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate the CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of $10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit realisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation' parameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to the Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter values that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO data, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values, thereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial conditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.</description>

      <title>CANUCS: Constraining the MACS J0416.1-2403 Strong Lensing Model with JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec and NIRCam</title>

Abstract: (Abridged) The strong lensing models of galaxy clusters rely on the number and quality of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We used NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model was constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, which we used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts from 111 background sources and includes 95 systems with previously known MUSE redshift and 16 systems (with 46 multiple images) for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Three of the spectroscopic systems were not identified by previous JWST studies. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is more than 20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of ~ 0.52''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. In total, we provide 15 new multiple-image system candidates (with 38 multiple images) not reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly NIRISS, for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts of multiple images. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII], [OIII] and H${\alpha}$ lines at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.</description>

      <title>Precisely Measuring the Cosmic Reionization History from IGM Damping Wings Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing the IGM damping wings imprinted on the proximity zones of quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whereas past work has typically forgone the additional constraining power afforded by the blue side continuum ($1216\,\r{A} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1280\,\r{A}$) and/or opted not to model the large correlated IGM transmission fluctuations in the proximity zone ($\lambda \lesssim 1216\,\r{A}$), we construct a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum accounting for all sources of error - the stochasticity induced by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, the unknown intrinsic spectrum of the quasar, and spectral noise. This principled Bayesian method allows us to marginalize out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar's radiation and its unknown intrinsic spectrum to precisely measure the IGM neutral fraction, $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$. A key element of our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) to describe the intrinsic quasar spectrum via a small number of nuisance parameters. Using a large sample of $15,559$ SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z \gtrsim 2.15$ we trained and quantified the performance of six distinct DR methods, and find that a six parameter PCA model (five coefficients plus a normalization) performs best, with complex machine learning approaches providing no advantage. By conducting statistical inference on 100 realistic mock EoR quasar spectra, we demonstrate the reliability of the credibility contours that we obtain on $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$ and the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$. The new method introduced here will transform IGM damping wings into a precision probe of reionization, on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Selection of high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies from broadband and wide photometric surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility of selecting high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBG) using current and future broadband wide photometric surveys, such as UNIONS or the Vera C. Rubin LSST. This work is conducted in the context of DESI-II, the next phase of DESI, which will start around 2029. We use deep imaging data from HSC and CLAUDS on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. To predict the selection performance of LBGs with image quality similar to UNIONS, we degrade the $u, g, r, i$ and $z$ bands to UNIONS depth. The Random Forest algorithm is trained with the $u,g,r,i$ and $z$ bands to classify LBGs in the $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ range. We find that fixing a target density budget of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$, the Random Forest approach gives a density of $z&gt;2$ targets of $873$ deg$^{-2}$, and a density of $493$ deg$^{-2}$ of confirmed LBGs after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI. This UNIONS-like selection was tested in a dedicated spectroscopic observation campaign of 1,000 targets with DESI on the COSMOS field, providing a safe spectroscopic sample with a mean redshift of 3. This sample is used to derive forecasts for DESI-II, assuming a sky coverage of 5,000 deg$^2$. We predict uncertainties on Alcock-Paczynski parameters $\alpha_\perp$ and $\alpha_{\parallel}$ to be 0.7$\%$ and 1$\%$ for $2.6&lt;z&lt;3.2$, resulting in a potential 2$\%$ measurement of the dark energy fraction at high redshift. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty in local non-Gaussianity and predict $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}\approx 7$, which would be comparable to the current best precision achieved by \textit{Planck}. The latter forecast suggests that achieving the precision required to place stringent constraints on inflationary models ($\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \approx 1$) using spectroscopic galaxy surveys necessitates the development of a next-generation (Stage V) spectroscopic survey.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the power spectrum turnover scale from the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and Quaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the projected clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing data from Planck, to measure the large-scale turnover of the matter power spectrum, associated with the size of the horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality. The turnover is detected with a significance of between $2.3$ and $3.1\sigma$, depending on the method used to quantify it. From this measurement, the equality scale is determined at the $\sim20\%$ level. Using the turnover scale as a standard ruler alone (suppressing information from the large-scale curvature of the power spectrum), in combination with supernova data through an inverse distance ladder approach, we measure the current expansion rate to be $H_0=62.7\pm17.2\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The addition of information coming from the power spectrum curvature approximately halves the standard ruler uncertainty. Our measurement in combination with calibrated supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and SH0ES constrains the CMB temperature to be $T_{\rm CMB}=3.10^{+0.48}_{-0.36}\,{\rm K}$, independently of CMB data. Alternatively, assuming the value of $T_{\rm CMB}$ from COBE-FIRAS, we can constrain the effective number of relativistic species in the early Universe to be $N_{\rm eff}=3.0^{+5.8}_{-2.9}$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Reformation in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can arise in a wide range of scenarios, from inflation to first-order phase transitions. Light PBHs, such as those produced during preheating, in bounce cosmologies, or at the GUT scale, could induce an early matter-dominated phase given a moderate initial abundance. During the early matter domination, the growth of initial PBH density perturbations can trigger collapse on horizon scales, producing much heavier PBHs. While the remaining original PBHs evaporate and reheat the Universe, these massive reformed PBHs survive for an extended period of time, producing potentially observable signatures at the present. We study this PBH reformation scenario and show that those reformed PBHs can emit significant quantities of gamma rays detectable by the next generation of experiments. The rapid reheating after matter domination generates a coincident stochastic gravitational wave background, which could be within the range of the upcoming CMB-S4 experiment. The PBH reformation scenario provides an intriguing possibility of decoupling the current PBH population and the initial formation mechanism from early Universe physics, while providing opportunities for observation through multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Implications for the non-Gaussianity of primordial gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic signal by recent pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, including NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, CPTA and MPTA, has opened a new window to explore gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies. Motivated by the possibility that such a signal could arise from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), we investigate the implications of tensor non-Gaussianity for the PGW power spectrum. Utilizing PTA data sets, we provide constraints on local-type tensor non-Gaussianity parameter ${F}_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We find $|{F}_{\mathrm{NL}}|\lesssim 7.97$ for a log-normal PGW power spectrum. Our analysis reveals that even moderate tensor non-Gaussianity can lead to significant deviations from standard predictions, thereby offering a novel means to test inflationary scenarios and probe the underlying dynamics of the early Universe. Future multi-band GW observatories, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, will be instrumental in complementing these efforts and further refining our understanding of tensor non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modelling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$($-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.7$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for $\kappa \gtrsim 30$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of in~situ stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28\% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12\% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define in~situ stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinise correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unravelling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(R,T)$ theory in light of gravitational wave standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we ponder observational constraints
  on the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where the gravitational action is
  a function of Ricci scalar $R$ plus the trace of the energy-momentum
  tensor $T$, regarding the functional form
  $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ with $f(T)=8\pi G\lambda T$.
  For this purpose, we utilize recently available data,
  including cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae,
  baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions
  measurements, together with forcasted gravitational wave
  (GW) data from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
  Notably, we examine the potentiality of simulated GW data
  from LISA standard sirens (SS) sources to enhance
  cosmological constraints on the $f(R,T)$ model parameters.
  In this regard, we create three LISA mock catalogs,
  namely Pop III, Delay, and No Delay, to improve the
  obtained constraints on cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$
  gravity from current observations. Numerical analysis
  reveals that mock GW data from LISA SS sources
  make marginal improvements on constraining the $f(R,T)$
  model cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Minimal Electroweak Baryogenesis via Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet $S$ with an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry offers a minimal framework for realizing electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) during a first-order electroweak phase transition. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism where spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking enables EWBG via domain walls separating two distinct phases of the $S$ field. These domain walls feature restored (or weakly broken) EW symmetry in their cores and sweep through space, generating the baryon asymmetry below the temperature of EW symmetry breaking. We identify the key conditions for the existence of EW-symmetric domain wall cores and analyze the dynamics required for wall propagation over sufficient spatial volumes. Additionally, we outline the CP-violating sources necessary for baryogenesis under different regimes of domain wall evolution. The parameter space accommodating this mechanism spans singlet masses from sub-eV to 15 GeV, accompanied by a non-vanishing mixing with the Higgs boson. Unlike the standard realization of EWBG in the minimal singlet-extended SM, which is notoriously difficult to test, our scenario can be probed by a wide range of existing and upcoming experiments, including fifth force searches, rare meson decays, and EDM measurements.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of dark matter halo merger trees and the consequences for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy formation and evolution models, such as semi-analytic models, are powerful theoretical tools for predicting how galaxies evolve across cosmic time. These models follow the evolution of galaxies based on the halo assembly histories inferred from large $N$-body cosmological simulations. This process requires codes to identify halos ("halo finder") and to track their time evolution ("tree builder"). While these codes generally perform well, they encounter numerical issues when handling dense environments. In this paper, we present how relevant these issues are in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We characterize two major numerical artefacts in halo assembly histories: (i) the non-physical swapping of large amounts of mass between subhalos, and (ii) the sudden formation of already massive subhalos at late cosmic times. We quantify these artefacts for different combinations of halo finder (SUBFIND, VELOCIRAPTOR, HBT-HERONS) and tree builder codes (D-TRESS+DHALO, TREEFROG, HBT-HERONS), finding that in general more than $50\%$ ($80\%$) of the more massive subhalos with $&gt;10^{3}$ ($&gt;10^{4}$) particles at $z=0$ inherit them in most cases. However, HBT-HERONS, which explicitly incorporates temporal information, effectively reduces the occurrence of these artefacts to $5\%$ ($10\%$). We then use the semi-analytic models SHARK and GALFORM to explore how these artefacts impact galaxy formation predictions. We demonstrate that the issues above lead to non-physical predictions in galaxies hosted by affected halos, particularly in SHARK where the modelling of baryons relies on subhalo information. Finally, we propose and implement fixes for the numerical artefacts at the semi-analytic model level, and use SHARK to show the improvements, especially at the high-mass end, after applying them.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>
