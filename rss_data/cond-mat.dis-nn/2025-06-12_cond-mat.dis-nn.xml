      <title>On the role of non-linear latent features in bipartite generative neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units - including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.</description>

      <title>Equations of state and stability condition of mixed p-spin glass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) is a foundational model for understanding spin glass systems. It is based on the pairwise interaction between each two spins in a fully connected lattice with quenched disordered interactions. The nature of long-range interaction among spins in the (SK) model simplifies the study of this system by eliminating fluctuations. An advanced (SK) model, known as the p-spin model, introduces higher-order interactions that involve the interaction of P spins. This research focuses on the general Hamiltonian of the spin glass model with long-range interaction, referred to as the mixed p-spin glass model, which consists of adding all p-spin interaction terms. This research aims to derive the equation of states for this Hamiltonian, formulate the equation of state within the framework of the first replica symmetry breaking, and determine both the stability condition of the replica symmetric solution and the stability of the replicas belonging to the same group in the first step of replica symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Neuromorphic Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</description>

      <title>Consciousness via MIPT?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a recently formulated phenomenon in out-of-equilibrium systems. The competition between unitary evolutions and measurement-induced non-unitaries leads to the transition between the entangled and disentangled phases at some critical measurement rate. We conjecture that self-organized MIPT plays a key role in the generative model of cognitive networks and the formation of the state of consciousness in the "newborn-adult" transition. To this aim, we formulate the probe-target picture for the brain and suggest that MIPT interpreted as learnability transition takes place in the mental part of the target where the sites in the cognitive networks of semantic memory are concepts. Comparison with the synchronization phase transitions in the probe is made.</description>

      <title>Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics in the vicinity of an unstable fixed point subjected to stochastic control. The stochastic competition between the system's inherent instability (pushing trajectories away) and engineered control dynamics (drawing them back to the same point) forms the core of probabilistic control in chaotic systems. Recent studies reveal that this interplay underlies a family of measurement- and feedback-driven dynamical quantum phase transitions. To capture its universal features, we consider the inverted harmonic oscillator, a canonical model whose operator amplitudes diverge. Our control scheme, a quantum version of classical attractor dynamics, employs non-unitary evolution via measurements and conditional resets. By combining numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck analysis, and direct spectra of the quantum channel, we map out the control transition and uncover quantum-specific signatures of the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate the universality of our results within the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning via Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that embeds the Schr\"{o}dinger equation directly into the machine learning procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit in certain settings and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</description>

      <title>The pursuit of happiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Happiness, in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was understood quite differently from today's popular notions of personal pleasure. Happiness implies a flourishing life - one of virtue, purpose, and contribution to the common good. This paper studies populations of individuals - that we call homo-felix - who maximise an objective function that we call happiness. The happiness of one individual depends on the payoffs that they receive in games they play with their peers as well as on the happiness of the peers they interact with. Individuals care more or less about others depending on whether that makes them more or less happy. This paper analyses the happiness feedback loops that result from these interactions in simple settings. We find that individuals tend to care more about individuals who are happier than what they would be by being selfish. In simple 2 x 2 game theoretic settings, we show that homo-felix can converge to a variety of equilibria which includes but goes beyond Nash equilibria. In an n-persons public good game we show that the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium is marginally unstable and a single individual who develops prosocial behaviour is able to drive almost the whole population to a cooperative state.</description>

      <title>Universal roughness and the dynamics of urban expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to quantity urban sprawl using tools from surface growth physics. Analyzing built-up area expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015), we uncover anisotropic growth with branch-like extensions and a piecewise linear relation between area and population. A universal local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}} \approx 0.54$ coexists with variable exponents $\beta$, $z$. As modeling urban sprawl remains an open problem, these results offer a necessary empirical basis for theory.</description>

      <title>FerroAI: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Phase Diagrams of Ferroelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composition-temperature phase diagrams are crucial for designing ferroelectric materials, however predicting them accurately remains challenging due to limited phase transformation data and the constraints of conventional methods. Here, we utilize natural language processing (NLP) to text-mine 41,597 research articles, compiling a dataset of 2,838 phase transformations across 846 ferroelectric materials. Leveraging this dataset, we develop FerroAI, a deep learning model for phase diagram prediction. FerroAI successfully predicts phase boundaries and transformations among different crystal symmetries in Ce/Zr co-doped BaTiO$3$ (BT)-$x$Ba${0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$TiO$_3$ (BCT). It also identifies a morphotropic phase boundary in Zr/Hf co-doped BT-$x$BCT at $x = 0.3$, guiding the discovery of a new ferroelectric material with an experimentally measured dielectric constant of 9535. These results establish FerroAI as a powerful tool for phase diagram construction, guiding the design of high-performance ferroelectric materials.</description>
