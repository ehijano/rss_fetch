      <title>A note on a classical dynamical system and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper a slightly modified version of the Bateman system, originally proposed to describe a damped harmonic oscillator, was proposed. This system is really different from the Bateman's one, in the sense that this latter cannot be recovered for any choice of its parameters. In this paper we consider this system and we show that, at a quantum level, it is not necessarily dissipative. In particular we show that the Hamiltonian of the system, when quantized, produces different behaviors, depending on some relations between its parameters. In fact, it gives rise to either a two dimensional (standard) harmonic oscillator, or to two independent oscillators, one of which is again {\em standard}, and a second one which is an inverted oscillator. The two cases are analyzed in terms of bosonic or pseudo-bosonic ladder operators, and the appearance of distributions for the inverted oscillator is commented.</description>

      <title>Irreversible dynamics on Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric construction of irreversible dynamics on Poisson manifolds that satisfies the axioms of metriplectic mechanics and the GENERIC framework. Our approach relies solely on the underlying Poisson structure and its deformation theory, without requiring any additional metric structure. Specifically, we show that if the second Lichnerowicz-Poisson cohomology group of a Poisson manifold is nontrivial, one can construct a symmetric bracket that generates irreversible dynamics compatible with energy conservation and entropy production. This bracket is derived from a 2-cocycle that deforms the original Poisson structure, thereby modifying the associated Casimir foliation. We illustrate the construction with two finite-dimensional examples, the duals of the Lie algebras of the special Euclidean group SE(2) and the Galilei group SGal(3). These examples demonstrate the applicability of the method in classical mechanics, control theory, and mathematical physics. Our framework naturally extends to infinite-dimensional settings, which are discussed as directions for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $O(n)$-invariant and reflection-positive quantum spin systems on the integer lattice in any dimension, and prove that spin-spin correlations decay exponentially fast provided n is large enough. This answers a question of Ueltschi, who proved that for small n there is instead long-range order (for d at least 3).</description>

      <title>Recovering the Topology in One Point Interaction Problem on Extended Non-Local Star Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author studies the inverse spectral problem of Sturm-Liouville operator on a star-like graph. To this star-like graph centered at the origin as its vertex, there are attached $m$ edges that imposed the Sturm-Liouville operator with certain non-local potential functions with some suitable local boundary value conditions. At the vertex, we consider one point interaction condition at vertex to model a network that fixed on the end of the edges on the graph. The vibration and flow changes are monitored at that vertex which serves as certain control/regulation center. The author shows that the system is solvable under very necessary conditions. It is crucial to recover the topology of the network. In this paper, author constructs the special solution edge by edge and point to point.</description>

      <title>Characteristic solutions of the chain of Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method has been presented of constructing a class of exact solutions of an infinite self-linking chain of the Vlasov equations for distribution functions of kinematic quantities of all orders. Using the characteristic transformation of variables proposed in this paper, any equation from the Vlasov chain can be reduced to the mathematical form of the first Vlasov equation. Since the solution of the first Vlasov equation can be found by the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, the authors have proposed an algorithm for constructing characteristic solutions for an arbitrary equation from the Vlasov chain. The proposed method of construction of exact solutions has been successfully implemented on an example of time-dependent quantum system with thermodynamic parameter in the form of inverse temperature. These found exact solutions are also applicable to quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quasinormal mode excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) through the plunge, merger and ringdown of an extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral into a Schwarzschild black hole, for generic orbital configurations. We work out the QNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to incorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the time-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the point-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs propagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is composed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a local ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation function'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at times $\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower of non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift modes. The model is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main waveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function are required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger waveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar mode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical solutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic binary configurations. Our work provides a first solid step towards analytically modeling the inspiral's imprint onto ringdown signals, generalizable to include higher orders in the mass ratio, black hole spin, non-vacuum configurations and corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Heavy-Light Asymptotics from Thermal Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of spectral densities and heavy-heavy-light (HHL) operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients in three-dimensional conformal field theories using thermal one-point functions on $S^1 \times S^2$. A central element of our analysis is a new inversion formula for one-point functions which is derived via Casimir differential equations. We develop systematic expansions of the spectral density and HHL OPE coefficients in the regime of large $\Delta_H$. We validate our analytic tools by comparing the results with the partial wave expansions of thermal one-point functions in free field theories. The algorithms developed for these expansions make full use of Casimir recursion relations, thereby extending their applicability into the heavy exchange regime. In the end, we observe excellent agreement with our analytic predictions and an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude compared to all previous leading order estimates of the CFT data even for moderate values of $\Delta_H$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing non-Markovianity via quantum coherence based on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new measure of non-Markovianity based on the property of nonincreasing quantum coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability under incoherent completely positive trace-preserving maps. Quantum coherence via the KD quasiprobability is defined as the imaginary part of the KD quasiprobability, which is maximised over all possible second bases and evaluated using an incoherent reference basis. A measure non-Markovianity based on KD quasiprobability coherence would capture memory effects via the time evolution of the imaginary part of the KD quasiprobability, providing an experimentally accessible and physically intuitive alternative to traditional measures relying on quantum Fisher information or trace distance. This approach is applied to the study of dissipation and dephasing dynamics in single- and two-qubit systems. The results obtained show that, in the cases studied, our measure based on coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability performs at least as well as $\ell_{1}$-norm coherence in detecting non-Markovianity, this provides a novel perspective on the analysis of non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Excitation-detector principle and the algebraic theory of planon-only abelian fracton orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study abelian planon-only fracton orders: a class of three-dimensional (3d) gapped quantum phases in which all fractional excitations are abelian particles restricted to move in planes with a common normal direction. In such systems, the mathematical data encoding fusion and statistics comprises a finitely generated module over a Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[t^\pm]$ equipped with a quadratic form giving the topological spin. The principle of remote detectability requires that every planon braids nontrivially with another planon. While this is a necessary condition for physical realizability, we observe - via a simple example - that it is not sufficient. This leads us to propose the $\textit{excitation-detector principle}$ as a general feature of gapped quantum matter. For planon-only fracton orders, the principle requires that every detector - defined as a string of planons extending infinitely in the normal direction - braids nontrivially with some finite excitation. We prove this additional constraint is satisfied precisely by perfect theories of excitations - those whose quadratic form induces a perfect Hermitian form. To justify the excitation-detector principle, we consider the 2d abelian anyon theory obtained by spatially compactifying a planon-only fracton order in a transverse direction. We prove the compactified 2d theory is modular if and only if the original 3d theory is perfect, showing that the excitation-detector principle gives a necessary condition for physical realizability that we conjecture is also sufficient. A key ingredient is a structure theorem for finitely generated torsion-free modules over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k} [t^\pm]$, where $p$ is prime and $k$ a natural number. Finally, as a first step towards classifying perfect theories of excitations, we prove that every theory of prime fusion order is equivalent to decoupled layers of 2d abelian anyon theories.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the upper and lower bounds on the minimum orbital period of 5-dimensional charged black holes. Our results indicate that the upper bound of the minimum orbital period corresponds to non-charged black holes, while the lower bound is achieved in the case of maximally charged black holes. We further establish precise analytical expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the minimum orbital period. Our findings provide valuable insights into 5-dimensional charged black holes and help constrain theoretical gravity models.</description>

      <title>Semi Analytical Solution of a Nonlinear Oblique Boundary Value Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new numerical method is developed to approximate the solution of Laplace's equation in the exterior of the sphere with a strongly nonlinear boundary value of oblique type. A functional analysis attempt to solve this type of boundary condition is not straight forward since results about existence and uniqueness of solution are still limited. Hence, a semi analytical method is described here to approach a solution. A perturbation solution around the monopole converts the nonlinear oblique problem into a series of known Neumann problems in the exterior of the sphere. The corresponding Green's function representation for the exterior Neumann problem gives an exact analytic solution for each perturbation step as an integral on the surface of the sphere. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions become very complicated and require to be approximated numerically. The perturbation solutions given by integrals of the Green's function on the sphere are computed at each perturbation step using different subdivisions of the surface integrals with the help of adaptive quadrature method. We call icosahedron method to the integration on the sphere with an icosahedron mesh using Gauss 5-point or adaptive quadrature, according to the integration parameter. This method was very effective to deal with the singularity of the Green's function successfully avoiding inaccuracies on the numerical approximation and is an important contribution of this work. The numerical perturbation scheme is performed for two given exact solutions. The icosahedron method is found to be very precise. The approximations show the desired properties: they get closer to the exact solutions as the perturbation parameter gets smaller, show rapid convergence in the exterior of the unit sphere and converge to zero as the radius grows.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple Lie algebra over the complex numbers, and let $\mathfrak{g}[u]$ denote its polynomial current algebra. In the mid-1980s, Drinfeld introduced the Yangian of $\mathfrak{g}$ as the unique solution to a quantization problem for a natural Lie bialgebra structure on $\mathfrak{g}[u]$. More precisely, Theorem 2 of [Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 283 (1985), no. 5, 1060-1064] asserts that $\mathfrak{g}[u]$ admits a unique homogeneous quantization, the Yangian of $\mathfrak{g}$, which is described explicitly via generators and relations, starting from a copy of $\mathfrak{g}$ and its adjoint representation. Although the representation theory of Yangians has since undergone substantial development, a complete proof of Drinfeld's theorem has not appeared. In this article, we present a proof of the assertion that $\mathfrak{g}[u]$ admits at most one homogeneous quantization. Our argument combines cohomological and computational methods, and outputs a presentation of any such quantization using Drinfeld's generators and a reduced set of defining relations.</description>

      <title>Trace Formulas in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace formulas appear in many forms in noncommutative geometry (NCG). In the first part of this thesis, we obtain results for asymptotic expansions of trace formulas like heat trace expansions by adapting the theory of Multiple Operator Integration to NCG. More broadly, this construction provides a natural language for operator integrals in NCG, which systematises and simplifies operator integral arguments throughout the literature. Towards this end, we construct a functional calculus for abstract pseudodifferential operators and generalise Peller's construction of multiple operator integrals to this abstract pseudodifferential calculus. In the process, we obtain a noncommutative Taylor formula.
  In the second part of this thesis, we shift our attention to Dixmier trace formulas. First, we provide an approximation of the noncommutative integral for spectrally truncated spectral triples in the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of operator system spectral triples. Our approximation has a close link to Quantum Ergodicity, which we will use to state an NCG analogue of the fundamental result that ergodic geodesic flow implies quantum ergodicity. Furthermore, we provide a Szeg\H{o} limit theorem in NCG. Next, we provide a Dixmier trace formula for the density of states, a measure originating in solid state physics that can be associated with an operator on a geometric space. We first provide this formula in the setting of discrete metric spaces, and then in the setting of manifolds of bounded geometry. The latter leads to a Dixmier trace formula for Roe's index on open manifolds.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of states in orbifolds of products of $N=2$ Superconformal ADE Minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A.Belavin, V.Belavin and S.Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of mirror group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and transforms the original orbifold into a mirror one. This transformation is by construction an isomorphism of $N=(2,2)$ models. We illustrate our construction for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

      <title>A Real Reduction of the Manifold of Bridgeland Stability Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a $k$-linear triangulated category. The space of Bridgeland stability conditions on $\mathcal{T}$, denoted by $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$, forms a complex manifold. In this paper, we introduce an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$ and study the quotient space $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T}) := \mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})/\sim$, which parametrizes what we call reduced stability conditions. We show that $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$ admits the structure of a real (possibly non-Hausdorff) manifold of half the dimension of $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$. The space $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$ preserves the wall-and-chamber structure of $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$, but in a significantly simpler form. Moreover, we define a relation $\lesssim$ on $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$, and show that the full stability manifold $\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{T})$ can be reconstructed from the space $\mathrm{Sb}(\mathcal{T})$ together with the additional data $\lesssim$.
  We then focus on the case where $\mathcal{T} = \mathrm{D}^b(X)$, the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth polarized variety $(X, H)$. By explicitly describing $\mathrm{Sb}(X)$ for varieties $X$ of small dimension, we formulate two equivalent conjectures concerning a family of stability conditions $\mathrm{Stab}_H^*(X)$ and their reduced counterparts $\mathrm{Sb}_H^*(X)$ on $\mathrm{D}^b(X)$. We establish some desirable properties for both families. In particular, using a version of the restriction theorem formulated in terms of $\lesssim$, we show that the existence of $\mathrm{Stab}_H^*(X)$ implies the existence of stability conditions on every smooth subvariety of $X$.</description>

Abstract: The second eigenfunction of the Neumann Laplacian on convex, planar domains is considered. Inspired by the famous hot spots conjecture and a related result of Steinerberger, we show that potential critical points of this eigenfunction (and, in particular, interior "hot spots") cannot be located "near the center" of the domain. The region in which critical points are excluded is described explicitly.</description>

      <title>Causal Decompositions of 1D Quantum Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum theory's causal structure stands out as a major matter, since it radically departs from classical notions of causality. We present advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality radius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more than $r$. We prove that, for $N \geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques, leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C* algebras.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis and design of shell-based thermal lattice metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis framework for investigating the thermal conductivity of shell lattice metamaterials, extending prior work from mechanical stiffness to heat transfer. Central to our analysis is a new metric, the asymptotic directional conductivity (ADC), which captures the leading-order influence of the middle surface geometry on the effective thermal conductivity in the vanishing-thickness limit. A convergence theorem is established for evaluating ADC, along with a sharp upper bound and the necessary and sufficient condition for achieving this bound. These results provide the first theoretical justification for the optimal thermal conductivity of triply periodic minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we show that ADC yields a third-order approximation to the effective conductivity of shell lattices at low volume fractions. To support practical design applications, we develop a discrete algorithm for computing and optimizing ADC over arbitrary periodic surfaces. Numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Topological Defect Propagation to Classify Knitted Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knits and crochets are mechanical metamaterials with a long history and can typically be produced from a single yarn. Despite the simplicity of the manufacturing process, they exhibit a wide range of structural configurations with diverse mechanical properties and application potential. Although there has been recent growing interest in textile-based metamaterials, a rigorous topological characterization of what makes a structure knittable has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce a general criterion based on topological constraints that distinguishes knits and crochets from other textile structures. We demonstrate how the introduction of topological defects and their propagation makes this classification practical. Our approach highlights a fundamental link between manufacturing processes and structural fragility. Within this framework, we show how the rationalization of defect propagation unlocks the design of fabrics with controllable resistance to damage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of trapped two-dimensional Bose gases with mean-field type interactions that can be attractive. We prove the stability of second kind of the many-body system and the convergence of the ground state energy per particle to that of a non-linear Schr\"odinger (NLS) energy functional. Notably, we can take any polynomial scaling of the interaction, and even exponential scalings arbitrarily close to the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, which is a drastic improvement on the best-known result for systems with attractive interactions. As a consequence of the stability of second kind we also obtain Bose-Einstein condensation for the many-body ground states for a much improved range of the diluteness parameter.</description>

      <title>Inequalities between Neumann and Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues on planar domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a classical inequality between the eigenvalues of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on bounded, planar domains: in 1955, Payne proved that below the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian there exist at least $k + 2$ eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian, provided the domain is convex. It has, however, been conjectured that this should hold for any domain. Here we show that the statement indeed remains true for all simply connected planar Lipschitz domains. The proof relies on a novel variational principle.</description>

Abstract: According to the Kolmogorovian Censorship Hypothesis, everything that quantum theory says about the world in the language of the quantum mechanical Hilbert space formalism is actually about relationships between ordinary relative frequencies expressible in operational terms using classical Kolmogorovian probability theory. In other words, a quantum theoretical description of a system should in principle be translatable into a purely operational-probabilistic description. However, our goal in this paper is different; we do not want to deal with the problem how to translate the known theory of quantum mechanics into operational terms, or to reconstruct the theory from postulates which can be interpreted in operational terms. Our aim is somewhat broader and points in the opposite direction. We start with a general scheme for the operational description of an arbitrary physical system. The description is based solely on the notion of observable events (measurement operations and measurement results) and on general, empirically established simple laws concerning their relative frequency. These laws are so simple and fundamental that they apply equally to any physical system. In the first part of the paper, we outline the basic elements of such an operational-probabilistic theory. In the second part, we discuss how this operational-probabilistic description compares to the quantum mechanical description and to what extent the standard Hilbert space quantum mechanics can be regarded as a reformulation of the general operational-probabilistic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In four spacetime dimensions, the classically integrable self-dual sectors of gauge theory and gravity have associated chiral algebras, which emerge naturally from their description in twistor space. We show that there are similar chiral algebras associated to integrable sectors of gauge theory and gravity whenever the spacetime dimension is an integer multiple of four. In particular, the hyperk\"ahler sector of gravity and the hyperholomorphic sector of gauge theory in $4m$-dimensions have well-known twistor descriptions giving rise to chiral algebras. Using twistor sigma models to describe these sectors, we demonstrate that the chiral algebras in higher-dimensions also arise as soft symmetry algebras under a certain notion of collinear limit. Interestingly, the chiral algebras and collinear limits in higher-dimensions are defined on the 2-sphere, rather than the full celestial sphere.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the information-theoretic and mathematical foundations of Benford's law, an important case of a statistical relationship that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general cause for Benford-like distributions to arise. We posit that they both follow from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. We also perform computational experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirichlet lambda function $\lambda(s)$ is defined for $\mathrm{Re}(s) &gt; 1$ by \[ \lambda(s) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2n+1)^s}. \] This function was initially studied by Euler on the real line, where he denoted it by $N(s)$. In this paper, by applying the partial fraction decomposition of $\pi \tan(\pi x)$ and explicit evaluations of the integrals \[ \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} x^{2m-1} \cos(2l\pi x) dx \quad \text{and} \quad \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} x^{m-1} \log \cos(\pi x) dx, \] for positive integers $l$ and $m$, we derive closed-form expressions for several classes of infinite series involving $\lambda(s)$. We also demonstrate that the values $\lambda(k)$ for even integers $k \geq 2$ arise as constant terms in the Fourier expansions of Eisenstein series associated with the congruence subgroup \[ \Gamma_0(2) := \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} \in \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) : c \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \right\}. \]</description>

      <title>Simple Sufficient Criteria for Optimality of Entanglement Witnesses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If one wants to establish optimality of a given bipartite entanglement witness, the current standard approach is to check whether it has the spanning property. Although this is not necessary for optimality, it is most often satisfied in practice, and for small enough dimensions or sufficiently structured witnesses this criterion can be checked by hand. In this work we introduce a novel characterization of the spanning property via entanglement-breaking channels, which in turn leads to a new sufficient criterion for optimality. This criterion amounts to just checking the kernel of some bipartite state. It is slightly weaker than the spanning property, but it is a lot easier to test for -- by hand as well as numerically -- and it applies to almost all witnesses which are known to have the spanning property. A second criterion is derived from this, where one can simply compute the expectation value of the given witness on a maximally entangled state. Finally, this approach implies new spectral constraints on witnesses as well as on positive maps.</description>
