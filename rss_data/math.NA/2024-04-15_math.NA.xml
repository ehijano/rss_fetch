      <title>Subspace method based on neural networks for solving the partial differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a subspace method based on neural networks (SNN) for solving the partial differential equation with high accuracy. The basic idea of our method is to use some functions based on neural networks as base functions to span a subspace, then find an approximate solution in this subspace. We design two special algorithms in the strong form of partial differential equation. One algorithm enforces the equation and initial boundary conditions to hold on some collocation points, and another algorithm enforces $L^2$-norm of the residual of the equation and initial boundary conditions to be $0$. Our method can achieve high accuracy with low cost of training. Moreover, our method is free of parameters that need to be artificially adjusted. Numerical examples show that the cost of training these base functions of subspace is low, and only one hundred to two thousand epochs are needed for most tests. The error of our method can even fall below the level of $10^{-10}$ for some tests. The performance of our method significantly surpasses the performance of PINN and DGM in terms of the accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Improved parameter selection strategy for the iterated Arnoldi-Tikhonov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iterated Arnoldi-Tikhonov (iAT) method is a regularization technique particularly suited for solving large-scale ill-posed linear inverse problems. Indeed, it reduces the computational complexity through the projection of the discretized problem into a lower-dimensional Krylov subspace, where the problem is then solved.
  This paper studies iAT under an additional hypothesis on the discretized operator. It presents a theoretical analysis of the approximation errors, leading to an a posteriori rule for choosing the regularization parameter. Our proposed rule results in more accurate computed approximate solutions compared to the a posteriori rule recently proposed in arXiv:2311.11823. The numerical results confirm the theoretical analysis, providing accurate computed solutions even when the new assumption is not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Conforming virtual element method for nondivergence form linear elliptic equations with Cordes coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an $H^2$-conforming Virtual Element Method (VEM) for the simplest linear elliptic PDEs in nondivergence form with Cordes coefficients. The VEM hinges on a hierarchical construction valid for any dimension $d \ge 2$. The analysis relies on the continuous Miranda-Talenti estimate for convex domains $\Omega$ and is rather elementary. We prove stability and error estimates in $H^2(\Omega)$, including the effect of quadrature, under minimal regularity of the data. Numerical experiments illustrate the interplay of coefficient regularity and convergence rates in $H^2(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>A backward differential deep learning-based algorithm for solving high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel backward differential deep learning-based algorithm for solving high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), where the deep neural network (DNN) models are trained not only on the inputs and labels but also the differentials of the corresponding labels. This is motivated by the fact that differential deep learning can provide an efficient approximation of the labels and their derivatives with respect to inputs. The BSDEs are reformulated as differential deep learning problems by using Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin derivatives of solution to a BSDE satisfy themselves another BSDE, resulting thus in a system of BSDEs. Such formulation requires the estimation of the solution, its gradient, and the Hessian matrix, represented by the triple of processes $\left(Y, Z, \Gamma\right).$ All the integrals within this system are discretized by using the Euler-Maruyama method. Subsequently, DNNs are employed to approximate the triple of these unknown processes. The DNN parameters are backwardly optimized at each time step by minimizing a differential learning type loss function, which is defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized BSDE system, with the first term providing the dynamics of the process $Y$ and the other the process $Z$. An error analysis is carried out to show the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Various numerical experiments up to $50$ dimensions are provided to demonstrate the high efficiency. Both theoretically and numerically, it is demonstrated that our proposed scheme is more efficient compared to other contemporary deep learning-based methodologies, especially in the computation of the process $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Riemannian optimization on the symplectic Stiefel manifold using second-order information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riemannian optimization is concerned with problems, where the independent variable lies on a smooth manifold. There is a number of problems from numerical linear algebra that fall into this category, where the manifold is usually specified by special matrix structures, such as orthogonality or definiteness. Following this line of research, we investigate tools for Riemannian optimization on the symplectic Stiefel manifold. We complement the existing set of numerical optimization algorithms with a Riemannian trust region method tailored to the symplectic Stiefel manifold. To this end, we derive a matrix formula for the Riemannian Hessian under a right-invariant metric. Moreover, we propose a novel retraction for approximating the Riemannian geodesics. Finally, we conduct a comparative study in which we juxtapose the performance of the Riemannian variants of the steepest descent, conjugate gradients, and trust region methods on selected matrix optimization problems that feature symplectic constraints.</description>

      <title>A stable decoupled perfectly matched layer for the 3D wave equation using the nodal discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In outdoor acoustics, the calculations of sound propagating in air can be computationally heavy if the domain is chosen large enough to fulfil the Sommerfeld radiation condition. By strategically truncating the computational domain with a efficient boundary treatment, the computational cost is lowered. One commonly used boundary treatment is the perfectly matched layer (PML) that dampens outgoing waves without polluting the computed solution in the inner domain. The purpose of this study is to propose and assess a new perfectly matched layer formulation for the 3D acoustic wave equation, using the nodal discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. The formulation is based on an efficient PML formulation that can be decoupled to further increase the computational efficiency and guarantee stability without sacrificing accuracy. This decoupled PML formulation is demonstrated to be long-time stable and an optimization procedure of the damping functions is proposed to enhance the performance of the formulation.</description>

      <title>An Interior Penalty coupling strategy for Isogeometric non-conformal Kirchhoff-Love shell patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the coupling of trimmed shell patches using Isogeometric Analysis, based on higher continuity splines that seamlessly meet the $C^1$ requirement of Kirchhoff-Love-based discretizations. Weak enforcement of coupling conditions is achieved through the symmetric interior penalty method, where the fluxes are computed using their correct variationally consistent expression that was only recently proposed and is unprecedentedly adopted herein in the context of coupling conditions. The constitutive relationships account for generically laminated materials, although the proposed tests are conducted under the assumption of uniform thickness and lamination sequence. Numerical experiments assess the method for an isotropic and a laminated plate, as well as an isotropic hyperbolic paraboloid shell from the new shell obstacle course. The boundary conditions and domain force are chosen to reproduce manufactured analytical solutions, which are taken as reference to compute rigorous convergence curves in the $L^2$, $H^1$, and $H^2$ norms, that closely approach optimal ones predicted by theory. Additionally, we conduct a final test on a complex structure comprising five intersecting laminated cylindrical shells, whose geometry is directly imported from a STEP file. The results exhibit excellent agreement with those obtained through commercial software, showcasing the method's potential for real-world industrial applications.</description>

      <title>The Rank-1 Completion Problem for Cubic Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the rank-$1$ tensor completion problem for cubic order tensors. First of all, we show that this problem is equivalent to a special rank-$1$ matrix recovery problem. We propose both nuclear norm relaxation and moment relaxation methods for solving the resulting rank-$1$ matrix recovery problem. The nuclear norm relaxation sometimes get a rank-$1$ tensor completion, while sometimes it does not. When it fails, we apply the moment hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations to solve the rank-$1$ matrix recovery problem. The moment hierarchy can always get a rank-$1$ tensor completion, or detect its nonexistence. In particular, when the tensor is strongly rank-$1$ completable, we show that the problem is equivalent to a rank-$1$ matrix completion problem and it can be solved by an iterative formula. Therefore, much larger size problems can be solved efficiently for strongly rank-$1$ completable tensors. Numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of these proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Perturbation analysis on T-eigenvalues of third-order tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbation analysis has emerged as a significant concern across multiple disciplines, with notable advancements being achieved, particularly in the realm of matrices. This study centers on specific aspects pertaining to tensor T-eigenvalues within the context of the tensor-tensor multiplication. Initially, an analytical perturbation analysis is introduced to explore the sensitivity of T-eigenvalues. In the case of third-order tensors featuring square frontal slices, we extend the classical Gershgorin disc theorem and show that all T-eigenvalues are located inside a union of Gershgorin discs. Additionally, we extend the Bauer-Fike theorem to encompass F-diagonalizable tensors and present two modified versions applicable to more general scenarios. The tensor case of the Kahan theorem, which accounts for general perturbations on Hermite tensors, is also investigated. Furthermore, we propose the concept of pseudospectra for third-order tensors based on tensor-tensor multiplication. We develop four definitions that are equivalent under the spectral norm to characterize tensor $\varepsilon$-pseudospectra. Additionally, we present several pseudospectral properties. To provide visualizations, several numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectra of specific tensors at different levels.</description>

      <title>An Incremental SVD Method for Non-Fickian Flows in Porous Media: Addressing Storage and Computational Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the numerical solution of the Non-Fickian flows at the current stage depends on all previous time instances. Consequently, the storage requirement increases linearly, while the computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of time steps. This presents a significant challenge for numerical simulations. While numerous existing methods address this issue, our proposed approach stems from a data science perspective and maintains uniformity. Our method relies solely on the rank of the solution data, dissociating itself from dependency on any specific partial differential equation (PDE). In this paper, we make the assumption that the solution data exhibits approximate low rank. Here, we present a memory-free algorithm, based on the incremental SVD technique, that exhibits only linear growth in computational complexity as the number of time steps increases. We prove that the error between the solutions generated by the conventional algorithm and our innovative approach lies within the scope of machine error. Numerical experiments are showcased to affirm the accuracy and efficiency gains in terms of both memory usage and computational expenses.</description>

      <title>Fast and forward stable randomized algorithms for linear least-squares problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative sketching and sketch-and-precondition are randomized algorithms used for solving overdetermined linear least-squares problems. When implemented in exact arithmetic, these algorithms produce high-accuracy solutions to least-squares problems faster than standard direct methods based on QR factorization. Recently, Meier, Nakatsukasa, Townsend, and Webb demonstrated numerical instabilities in a version of sketch-and-precondition in floating point arithmetic (arXiv:2302.07202). The work of Meier et al. raises the question: Is there a randomized least-squares solver that is both fast and stable? This paper resolves this question in the affirmative by proving that iterative sketching, appropriately implemented, is forward stable. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings, demonstrating that iterative sketching is stable and faster than QR-based solvers for large problem instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the POD-DNN, a novel algorithm leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) along with radial basis functions (RBFs) in the context of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reduced basis method (RBM), aimed at approximating the parametric mapping of parametric partial differential equations on irregular domains. The POD-DNN algorithm capitalizes on the low-dimensional characteristics of the solution manifold for parametric equations, alongside the inherent offline-online computational strategy of RBM and DNNs. In numerical experiments, POD-DNN demonstrates significantly accelerated computation speeds during the online phase. Compared to other algorithms that utilize RBF without integrating DNNs, POD-DNN substantially improves the computational speed in the online inference process. Furthermore, under reasonable assumptions, we have rigorously derived upper bounds on the complexity of approximating parametric mappings with POD-DNN, thereby providing a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's empirical performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common way to numerically solve Fokker-Planck equations is the Chang-Cooper method in space combined with one of the Euler methods in time. However, the explicit Euler method is only conditionally positive, leading to severe restrictions on the time step to ensure positivity. On the other hand, the implicit Euler method is robust but nonlinearly implicit. Instead, we propose to combine the Chang-Cooper method with unconditionally positive Patankar-type time integration methods, since they are unconditionally positive, robust for stiff problems, only linearly implicit, and also higher-order accurate. We describe the combined approach, analyse it, and present a relevant numerical example demonstrating advantages compared to schemes proposed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unfitted finite element methods, like CutFEM, have traditionally been implemented in a matrix-based fashion, where a sparse matrix is assembled and later applied to vectors while solving the resulting linear system. With the goal of increasing performance and enabling algorithms with polynomial spaces of higher degrees, this contribution chooses a more abstract approach by matrix-free evaluation of the operator action on vectors instead. The proposed method loops over cells and locally evaluates the cell, face, and interface integrals, including the contributions from cut cells and the different means of stabilization. The main challenge is the efficient numerical evaluation of terms in the weak form with unstructured quadrature points arising from the unfitted discretization in cells cut by the interface. We present design choices and performance optimizations for tensor-product elements and demonstrate the performance by means of benchmarks and application examples. We demonstrate a speedup of more than one order of magnitude for the operator evaluation of a discontinuous Galerkin discretization with polynomial degree three compared to a sparse matrix-vector product and develop performance models to quantify the performance properties over a wide range of polynomial degrees.</description>

      <title>A novel dual-decomposition method for non-convex mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the novel p-branch-and-bound method for solving two-stage stochastic programming problems whose deterministic equivalents are represented by non-convex mixed-integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming (MIQCQP) models. The precision of the solution generated by the p-branch-and-bound method can be arbitrarily adjusted by altering the value of the precision factor p. The proposed method combines two key techniques. The first one, named p-Lagrangian decomposition, generates a mixed-integer relaxation of a dual problem with a separable structure for a primal non-convex MIQCQP problem. The second one is a version of the classical dual decomposition approach that is applied to solve the Lagrangian dual problem and ensures that integrality and non-anticipativity conditions are met once the optimal solution is obtained. This paper also presents a comparative analysis of the p-branch-and-bound method efficiency considering two alternative solution methods for the dual problems as a subroutine. These are the proximal bundle method and Frank-Wolfe progressive hedging. The latter algorithm relies on the interpolation of linearisation steps similar to those taken in the Frank-Wolfe method as an inner loop in the classic progressive hedging. The p-branch-and-bound method's efficiency was tested on randomly generated instances and demonstrated superior performance over commercial solver Gurobi.</description>

      <title>Eulerian Formulation of the Tensor-Based Morphology Equations for Strain-Based Blood Damage Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of blood-handling medical devices, such as ventricular assist devices, requires the analysis of their biocompatibility. Among other aspects, this includes hemolysis, i.e., red blood cell damage. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are employed to predict blood flow in prototypes. The most basic hemolysis models directly estimate red blood cell damage from fluid stress in the resulting flow field. More advanced models explicitly resolve cell deformation. On the downside, these models are typically written in a Lagrangian formulation, i.e., they require pathline tracking. We present a new Eulerian description of cell deformation, enabling the evaluation of the solution across the whole domain. The resulting hemolysis model can be applied to any converged CFD simulation due to one-way coupling with the fluid velocity field. We discuss the efficient numerical treatment of the model equations in a stabilized finite element context. We verify the model by comparison to the original Lagrangian formulation in selected benchmark flows. Two more complex test cases demonstrate the method's capabilities in real-world applications. The results highlight the advantages over previous hemolysis models. In conclusion, the model holds great potential for the design process of future generations of medical devices.</description>
