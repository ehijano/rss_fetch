      <title>On some linear equations associated with dispersionless integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a recently proposed scheme of matrix extension of dispersionless integrable systems for the Abelian case, in which it leads to linear equations, connected with the initial dispersionless system. In the examples considered, these equations can be interpreted in terms of Abelian gauge fields on the geometric background defined by the dispersionless system. They are also connected with the linearisation of initial systems. We construct solutions to these linear equations in terms of wave functions of the Lax pair for dispersionless system, which is represented in terms of some vector fields.</description>

      <title>Integrable semi-discretization for a modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, an integrable semi-discretization of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with cubic nonlinearity is presented. The key points of the construction are based on the discrete Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and appropriate definition of discrete reciprocal transformations. First, we demonstrate that these bilinear equations and their determinant solutions can be derived from the discrete KP equation through Miwa transformation and some reductions. Then, by scrutinizing the reduction process, we obtain a set of semi-discrete bilinear equations and their general soliton solutions in the Gram-type determinant form. Finally, we obtain an integrable semi-discrete analog of the mCH equation by introducing dependent variables and discrete reciprocal transformation. It is also shown that the semi-discrete mCH equation converges to the continuous one in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Investigation of shallow water waves near the coast or in lake environments via the KdV-Calogero-Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow water waves phenomena in nature attract the attention of scholars and play an important role in fields such as tsunamis, tidal waves, solitary waves, and hydraulic engineering. Hereby, for the shallow water waves phenomena in various natural environments, we study the KdV-Calogero-Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff (KdV-CBS) equation. Based on the Bell polynomial theory, the B{\"a}cklund transformation, Lax pair and infinite conservation laws of the KdV-CBS equation are derived, and it is proved that it is completely integrable in Lax pair sense. Various types of mixed solutions are constructed by using a combination of Homoclinic test method and Mathematica symbolic computations. These findings have important significance for the discipline, offering vital insights into the intricate dynamics of the KdV-CBS equation. We hope that our research results could help the researchers understand the nonlinear complex phenomena of the shallow water waves in oceans, rivers and coastal areas.</description>
