      <title>MagAO-X: Commissioning Results and Status of Ongoing Upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MagAO-X is the coronagraphic extreme adaptive optics system for the 6.5 m Magellan Clay Telescope. We report the results of commissioning the first phase of MagAO-X. Components now available for routine observations include: the &gt;2 kHz high-order control loop consisting of a 97 actuator woofer deformable mirror (DM), a 2040 actuator tweeter DM, and a modulated pyramid wavefront sensor (WFS); classical Lyot coronagraphs with integrated low-order (LO) WFS and control using a third 97-actuator non-common path correcting (NCPC) DM; broad band imaging in g, r, i, and z filters with two EMCCDs; simultaneous differential imaging in H-alpha; and integral field spectroscopy with the VIS-X module. Early science results include the discovery of an H-alpha jet, images of accreting protoplanets at H-alpha, images of young extrasolar giant planets in the optical, discovery of new white dwarf companions, resolved images of evolved stars, and high-contrast images of circumstellar disks in scattered light in g-band (500 nm). We have commenced an upgrade program, called "Phase II", to enable high-contrast observations at the smallest inner working angles possible. These upgrades include a new 952 actuator NCPC DM to enable coronagraphic wavefront control; phase induced amplitude apodization coronagraphs; new fast cameras for LOWFS and Lyot-LOWFS; and real-time computer upgrades. We will report the status of these upgrades and results of first on-sky testing in March-May 2024.</description>

      <title>More data than you want, less data than you need: machine learning approaches to starlight subtraction with MagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging data analysis depends on removing residual starlight from the host star to reveal planets and disks. Most observers do this with principal components analysis (i.e. KLIP) using modes computed from the science images themselves. These modes may not be orthogonal to planet and disk signals, leading to over-subtraction. The wavefront sensor data recorded during the observation provide an independent signal with which to predict the instrument point-spread function (PSF). MagAO-X is an extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) system for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope and a technology pathfinder for ExAO with GMagAO-X on the upcoming Giant Magellan Telescope. MagAO-X is designed to save all sensor information, including kHz-speed wavefront measurements. Our software and compressed data formats were designed to record the millions of training samples required for machine learning with high throughput. The large volume of image and sensor data lets us learn a PSF model incorporating all the information available. This will eventually allow us to probe smaller star-planet separations at greater sensitivities, which will be needed for rocky planet imaging.</description>

      <title>High-Contrast Imaging at First-Light of the GMT: The Preliminary Design of GMagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the preliminary design of GMagAO-X, the first-light high-contrast imager planned for the Giant Magellan Telescope. GMagAO-X will realize the revolutionary increase in spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the 25 m GMT. It will enable, for the first time, the spectroscopic characterization of nearby potentially habitable terrestrial exoplanets orbiting late-type stars. Additional science cases include: reflected light characterization of mature giant planets; measurement of young extrasolar giant planet variability; characterization of circumstellar disks at unprecedented spatial resolution; characterization of benchmark stellar atmospheres at high spectral resolution; and mapping of resolved objects such as giant stars and asteroids. These, and many more, science cases will be enabled by a 21,000 actuator extreme adaptive optics system, a coronagraphic wavefront control system, and a suite of imagers and spectrographs. We will review the science-driven performance requirements for GMagAO-X, which include achieving a Strehl ratio of 70% at 800 nm on 8th mag and brighter stars, and post-processed characterization at astrophysical flux-ratios of 1e-7 at 4 lambda/D (26 mas at 800 nm) separation. We will provide an overview of the resulting mechanical, optical, and software designs optimized to deliver this performance. We will also discuss the interfaces to the GMT itself, and the concept of operations. We will present an overview of our end-to-end performance modeling and simulations, including the control of segment phasing, as well as an overview of prototype lab demonstrations. Finally, we will review the results of Preliminary Design Review held in February, 2024.</description>

      <title>MagAO-X Phase II Upgrades: Implementation and First On-Sky Results of a New Post-AO 1000 Actuator Deformable Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MagAO-X is the extreme coronagraphic adaptive optics (AO) instrument for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope and is currently undergoing a comprehensive batch of upgrades. One innovation that the instrument features is a deformable mirror (DM) dedicated for non-common path aberration correction (NCPC) within the coronagraph arm. We recently upgraded the 97 actuator NCPC DM with a 1000 actuator Boston Micromachines Kilo-DM which serves to (1) correct non-common path aberrations which hamper performance at small inner-working angles, (2) facilitate focal-plane wavefront control algorithms (e.g., electric field conjugation) and (3) enable 10 kHz correction speeds (up from 2 kHz) to assist post-AO, real-time low-order wavefront control. We present details on the characterization and installation of this new DM on MagAO-X as part of our efforts to improve deep contrast performance for imaging circumstellar objects in reflected light. Pre-installation procedures included use of a Twyman-Green interferometer to build an interaction matrix for commanding the DM surface, in closed-loop, to a flat state for seamless integration into the instrument. With this new NCPC DM now installed, we report on-sky results from the MagAO-X observing run in March -- May 2024 for the Focus Diversity Phase Retrieval and implicit Electric Field Conjugation algorithms for quasistatic speckle removal and in-situ Strehl ratio optimization, respectively.</description>

      <title>High-contrast imaging at first-light of the GMT: the wavefront sensing and control architecture of GMagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (GMagAO-X) instrument is a first-light high-contrast imaging instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). GMagAO-X's broad wavelength range and the large 25-meter aperture of the GMT creates new challenges: control of all 21.000 actuators; phasing GMT's segmented primary mirror to nm levels; active control of atmospheric dispersion to sub milli-arcsecond residuals; no chromatic pupil shear to minimize chromatic compensation errors; integrated focal plane wavefront sensing and control (WFSC). GMagAO-X will have simultaneous visible and infra-red WFS channels to control the 21.000 actuator DM. The infra-red arm will be flexible by incorporating switchable sensors such as the pyramid or Zernike WFS. One innovation that we developed for GMagAO-X is the Holographic Dispersed Fringe Sensor that measures differential piston. We have also developed several integrated coronagraphic wavefront sensors to control non-common path aberrations exactly where we need to sense them. We will discuss the key components of the WFSC strategies for GMagAO-X that address the challenges posed by the first high-contrast imaging system on the ELTs.</description>

      <title>On-sky, real-time optical gain calibration on MagAO-X using incoherent speckles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of extreme adaptive optics (AO) must be calibrated exceptionally well to achieve the desired contrast for ground-based direct imaging exoplanet targets. Current wavefront sensing and control system responses deviate from lab calibration throughout the night due to non linearities in the wavefront sensor (WFS) and signal loss. One cause of these changes is the optical gain (OG) effect, which shows that the difference between actual and reconstructed wavefronts is sensitive to residual wavefront errors from partially corrected turbulence. This work details on-sky measurement of optical gain on MagAO-X, an extreme AO system on the Magellan Clay 6.5m. We ultimately plan on using a method of high-temporal frequency probes on our deformable mirror to track optical gain on the Pyramid WFS. The high-temporal frequency probes, used to create PSF copies at 10-22 lambda /D, are already routinely used by our system for coronagraph centering and post-observation calibration. This method is supported by the OG measurements from the modal response, measured simultaneously by sequenced pokes of each mode. When tracked with DIMM measurements, optical gain calibrations show a clear dependence on Strehl Ratio, and this relationship is discussed. This more accurate method of calibration is a crucial next step in enabling higher fidelity correction and post processing techniques for direct imaging ground based systems.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Misalignment Tolerances for Implicit Electric Field Conjugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High contrast imaging of extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks requires extreme wavefront stability. Such stability can be achieved with active wavefront control (WFC). The next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes will require a robust form of WFC in order to image planets at small inner working angles and extreme flux ratios with respect to the host star. WFC algorithms such as implicit Electric Field Conjugation (iEFC) reduce stellar leakage by minimizing the electric field within a given region of an image, creating a dark hole. iEFC utilizes an empirical approach to sense and remove speckles in the focal plane. While iEFC is empirically calibrated and can handle optical model errors, there are still model assumptions made during the calibration. The performance of iEFC will degrade if the system changes due to slow, optomechanical drifts. In this work, we assess the iEFC performance impacts of pupil misalignments on the deformable mirror and focal plane misalignments on the detector. We base our analysis on the MagAO-X instrument, an extreme AO system installed on the Magellan-Clay telescope, to develop iEFC misalignment tolerancing requirements for both ground- and space-based missions. We present end-to-end physical optics simulations of the MagAO-X instrument, demonstrating iEFC alignment tolerance.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Mixture Separation for Future Gravitational Wave Observatories Utilizing Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), are expected to detect gravitational wave signals, some of which are likely to overlap with each other. This overlap may lead to misidentification as a single GW event, potentially biasing the estimated parameters of mixture GWs. In this paper, we adapt the concept of speech separation to address this issue by applying it to signal separation of overlapping GWs. We show that deep learning models can effectively separate overlapping GW signals. The proposed method may aid in eliminating biases in parameter estimation for such signals.</description>

      <title>Into the depths: Unveiling ELAIS-N1 with LOFAR's deepest sub-arcsecond wide-field images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the deepest wide-field 115-166 MHz image at sub-arcsecond resolution spanning an area of 2.5 by 2.5 degrees centred at the ELAIS-N1 deep field. To achieve this, we improved the calibration for the International LOFAR Telescope. This enhancement enabled us to efficiently process 32 hrs of data from four different 8-hr observations using the high-band antennas (HBAs) of all 52 stations, covering baselines up to approximately 2,000 km across Europe. The DI calibration was improved by using an accurate sky model and refining the series of calibration steps on the in-field calibrator, while the DD calibration was improved by adopting a more automated approach for selecting the DD calibrators and inspecting the self-calibration on these sources. We also added an additional round of self-calibration for the Dutch core and remote stations in order to refine the solutions for shorter baselines. To complement our highest resolution at 0.3", we also made intermediate resolution wide-field images at 0.6" and 1.2". Our resulting wide-field images achieve a central noise level of 14 muJy/beam at 0.3", doubling the depth and uncovering four times more objects than the Lockman Hole deep field image at comparable resolution but with only 8 hrs of data. Compared to LOFAR imaging without the international stations, we note that due to the increased collecting area and the absence of confusion noise, we reached a point-source sensitivity comparable to a 500-hr ELAIS-N1 6" image with 16 times less observing time. Importantly, we have found that the computing costs for the same amount of data are almost halved (to about 139,000 CPU hrs per 8 hrs of data) compared to previous efforts, though they remain high. Our work underscores the value and feasibility of exploiting all Dutch and international LOFAR stations to make deep wide-field images at sub-arcsecond resolution.</description>

      <title>TCSpy: Multi-telescope Array Control Software for 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel software called TCSpy which is designed to efficiently control a multi-telescope array through network-based protocols. The primary objectives of TCSpy include centralized control of the array, support for diverse observation modes, and swift responses to the follow-up observations of astronomical transients. To achieve these objectives, TCSpy utilizes the ASCOM Alpaca protocol in conjunction with Alpyca, establishing robust communication among multiple telescope units. For the practical application of TCSpy, we implement TCSpy within the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT). 7DT is a telescope array consisting of 20, 0.5-m telescopes, equipped with 40 different medium-band filters. The main scientific goals of 7DT include detecting the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources, identifying kilonovae, and the spectral mapping of the southern sky. Through the integration of TCSpy, 7DT can achieve these scientific objectives with its unique observation modes and rapid follow-up capabilities.</description>

      <title>Optimizing VGOS observations using an SNR-based scheduling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geodetic and astrometric VLBI community is in the process of upgrading its existing infrastructure with VGOS. The primary objective of VGOS is to substantially boost the number of scans per hour for enhanced parameter estimation. However, the current observing strategy results in fewer scans than anticipated. During 2022, six 24-hour VGOS R&amp;D sessions were conducted to demonstrate a proof-of-concept aimed at addressing this shortcoming. The new observation strategy centers around a signal-to-noise (SNR)-based scheduling approach combined with eliminating existing overhead times in existing VGOS sessions. Two SNR-based scheduling approaches were tested during these sessions: one utilizing inter-/extrapolation of existing S/X source flux density models and another based on a newly derived source flux density catalog at VGOS frequencies. Both approaches proved effective, leading to a 2.3-fold increase in the number of scheduled scans per station and a 2.6-fold increase in the number of observations per station, while maintaining a high observation success rate of approximately 90-95%. Consequently, both strategies succeeded in the main objective of these sessions by successfully increasing the number of scans per hour. The strategies described in this work can be easily applied to operational VGOS observations. Besides outlining and discussing the observation strategy, we further provide insight into the resulting signal-to-noise ratios, and discuss the impact on the precision of the estimated geodetic parameters. Monte Carlo simulations predicted a roughly 50% increase in geodetic precision compared to operational VGOS sessions. The analysis confirmed that the formal errors in estimated station coordinates were reduced by 40-50%. Additionally, Earth orientation parameters showed significant improvement, with a 40-50% reduction in formal errors.</description>

      <title>A millisecond pulsar position determined to 0.2 milliarcsecond precision with VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise millisecond pulsar (MSP) positions determined with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) hold the key to building the connection between the kinematic and dynamic reference frames respectively used by VLBI and pulsar timing. The frame connection would provide an important pathway to examining the planetary ephemerides used in pulsar timing, and potentially enhancing the sensitivities of pulsar timing arrays used to detect stochastic gravitational-wave background at nano-Hz regime. We aim at significantly improving the VLBI-based MSP position from its current $\gtrsim1\,$mas precision level by reducing the two dominant components in the positional uncertainty -- the propagation-related uncertainty and the uncertainty resulting from the frequency-dependent core shifts of the reference sources. We introduce a new differential astrometry strategy of using multiple calibrators observed at several widely separated frequencies, which we call PINPT (Phase-screen Interpolation plus frequeNcy-dePendent core shifT correction; read as "pinpoint") for brevity. The strategy allows determination of the core-shift and mitigates the impact of residual delay in the atmosphere. We implemented the strategy on PSR J2222-0137, an MSP well constrained astrometrically with VLBI and pulsar timing. Using the PINPT strategy, we determined core shifts for 4 AGNs around PSR J2222-0137, and derived a VLBI-based pulsar position with uncertainty of 0.17 mas and 0.32 mas in right ascension and declination, respectively, approaching the uncertainty level of the best-determined timing-based MSP positions. The realization of the PINPT strategy promises a factor-of-5 positional precision enhancement (over conventional VLBI astrometry) for all kinds of compact radio sources observed at $\lesssim2$ GHz, including most fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Star and Planet Formation with the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) Space Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) is a far-infrared space mission concept with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. Saltus consists of a 14-m inflatable primary, providing 16 times the sensitivity and 4 times the angular resolution of Herschel, and two cryogenic detectors spanning a wavelength range of 34-660 microns and spectral resolving power of 300 - 1e7. Spectroscopic observations in the far-infrared offer many unique windows into the processes of star and planet formation. These include observations of low energy water transitions, the H2 mass tracer HD, many CHONS constraining molecules such as NH3 and H2S, and emission lines from the phonon modes of molecular ices. Observing these species will allow us to build a statistical sample of protoplanetary disk masses, characterize the water snowline, identify Kuiper Belt like debris rings around other stars, and trace the evolution CHONS from prestellar cores, through to protoplanetary disks and debris disks. This paper details details several key star and planet formation science goals achievable with SALTUS.</description>

      <title>Improving polarimetric accuracy of RoboPol to $&lt;$ 0.05 % using a half-wave plate calibrator system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RoboPol is a four-channel, one-shot linear optical polarimeter that has been successfully operating since 2013 on the 1.3 m telescope at Skinakas Observatory in Crete, Greece. Using its unique optical system, it measures the linear Stokes parameters $q$ and $u$ in a single exposure with high polarimetric accuracy of 0.1% - 0.15% and 1 degree in polarization angle in the R broadband filter. Its performance marginally degrades in other broadband filters. The source of the current instrumental performance limit has been identified as unaccounted and variable instrumental polarization, most likely originating from factors such as temperature and gravity-induced instrument flexure. To improve the performance of RoboPol in all broadband filters, including R, we have developed a rotating half-wave plate calibrator system. This calibrator system is placed at the beginning of the instrument and enables modulation of polarimetric measurements by beam swapping between all four channels of RoboPol.
  Using the new calibrator system, we observed multiple polarimetric standard stars over two annual observing seasons with RoboPol. This has enabled us to achieve a polarimetric accuracy of better than 0.05 % in both $q$ and $u$, and 0.5 degrees in polarization angle across all filters, enhancing the instrument's performance by a factor of two to three.</description>

      <title>A Novel Freeform Slicer IFU for the Magellan InfraRed Multi-Object Spectrograph (MIRMOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellan InfraRed Multi-Object Spectrograph (MIRMOS) is a planned next generation multi-object and integral field spectrograph for the 6.5m Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. MIRMOS will perform R$\sim$3700 spectroscopy over a simultaneous wavelength range of 0.886 - 2.404$\mu$m (Y,J,H,K bands) in addition to imaging over the range of 0.7 - 0.886$\mu$m. The integral field mode of operation for MIRMOS will be achieved via an image slicer style integral field unit (IFU) located on a linear stage to facilitate movement into the beam during use or storage while operating in multi-object mode. The IFU will provide a $\rm \sim20"\times26"$ field of view (FoV) made up of $\rm0.84"\times26"$ slices. This will be the largest FoV IFS operating at these wavelengths from either the ground or space, making MIRMOS an ideal instrument for a wide range of science cases including studying the high redshift circumgalactic medium and emission line tracers from ionized and molecular gas in nearby galaxies. In order to achieve the desired image quality and FoV while matching the focal ratio to the multi-object mode, our slicer design makes use of novel freeform surfaces for the pupil mirrors, which require the use of high precision multi-axis diamond milling to manufacture. We present here the optical design and predicted performance of the MIRMOS IFU along with a conceptual design for the opto-mechanical system.</description>

      <title>GEM-based TPC with CCD Imaging for Directional Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.02170v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world's leading directional dark matter experiments currently all utilize low-pressure gas Time Projection Chamber (TPC) technologies. We discuss some of the challenges for this technology, for which balancing the goal of achieving the best sensitivity with that of cost effective scale-up requires optimization over a large parameter space. Critical for this are the precision measurements of the fundamental properties of both electron and nuclear recoil tracks down to the lowest detectable energies. Such measurements are necessary to provide a benchmark for background discrimination and directional sensitivity that could be used for future optimization studies for directional dark matter experiments. In this paper we describe a small, high resolution, high signal- to-noise GEM-based TPC with a 2D CCD readout designed for this goal. The performance of the detector was characterized using alpha particles, X-rays, gamma-rays, and neutrons, enabling detailed measurements of electron and nuclear recoil tracks. Stable effective gas gains of greater than $1 \times 10^5$ were obtained in 100 Torr of pure CF$_4$ by a cascade of three standard CERN GEMs each with a 140 $\mu$m pitch. The high signal-to-noise and sub-millimeter spatial resolution of the GEM amplification and CCD readout, together with low diffusion, allow for excellent background discrimination between electron and nuclear recoils down below $\sim$10 keVee ($\sim$23 keVr fluorine recoil). Even lower thresholds, necessary for the detection of low mass WIMPs for example, might be achieved by lowering the pressure and utilizing full 3D track reconstruction. These and other paths for improvements are discussed, as are possible fundamental limitations imposed by the physics of energy loss.</description>

      <title>Imaging $^{55}$Fe Electron Tracks in a GEM-based TPC Using a CCD Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:1703.09883v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Images of resolved 5.9 keV electron tracks produced from $^{55}$Fe X-ray interactions are presented for the first time using an optical readout time projection chamber (TPC). The corresponding energy spectra are also shown, with the FWHM energy resolution in the 30-40\% range depending on gas pressure and gain. These tracks were produced in low pressure carbon tetrafluoride (CF$_4$) gas, and imaged with a fast lens and low noise CCD camera system using the secondary scintillation produced in GEM/THGEM amplification devices. The GEM/THGEMs provided effective gas gains of $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^5$ in CF$_4$ at low pressures in the 25-100 Torr range. The ability to resolve such low energy particle tracks has important applications in dark matter and other rare event searches, as well as in X-ray polarimetry. A practical application of the optical signal from $^{55}$Fe is that it provides a tool for mapping the detector gain spatial uniformity.</description>

      <title>A New Probe of $\mu$Hz Gravitational Waves with FRB Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Fast Radio Burst (FRB) timing, which uses the precision measurements of the arrival time differences of repeated FRB signals along multiple sightlines, as a new probe of gravitational waves (GWs) around nHz to $\mu$Hz frequencies, with the highest frequency limited by FRB repeating period. The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of tens of AU, achieved by sending radio telescopes to space. We find the signal of arrival time difference induced by GWs depends only on the local GWs in the solar system and we can correlate the measurements from different FRB sources or the same source with different repeaters, which leads to a better sensitivity with a larger number of FRB repeaters detected. The projected sensitivity shows this method is a competitive probe in the nHz to $\mu$Hz frequency range. It can fill the '$\mu$Hz gap' between pulsar timing arrays and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and is complementary to other proposals of GW detection in this frequency band.</description>

      <title>MC-BLOS: Determination of the Line-of-Sight Component of Magnetic Fields Associated with Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years a number of surveys and telescopes have observed the plane-of-sky component of magnetic fields associated with molecular clouds. However, observations of their line-of-sight magnetic field remain limited. To address this issue, Tahani et al. (2018) developed a technique based on Faraday rotation. The technique incorporates an ON-OFF approach to identify the rotation measure induced by the magnetic fields associated with the cloud. The upcoming abundance of Faraday rotation observations from the Square Kilometer Array and its pathfinders necessitates robustly-tested software to automatically obtain line-of-sight magnetic fields of molecular clouds. We developed software, called MC-BLOS (Molecular Cloud Line-of-Sight Magnetic Field), to carry out the technique in an automated manner. The software's input are Faraday rotation of point sources (extra-galactic sources or pulsars), extinction or column density maps, chemical evolution code results, and a text/CSV file, which allows the user to specify the cloud name or other parameters pertaining to the technique. For each cloud, the software invokes a set of predefined initial parameters such as density, temperature, and surrounding boundary, which the user can modify. The software then runs the technique automatically, outputting line-of-sight magnetic field maps and tables (including uncertainties) at the end of the process. This automated approach significantly reduces analysis time compared to manual methods. We have tested the software on previously-published clouds, and the results are consistent within the reported uncertainty range. This software will facilitate the analysis of forthcoming Faraday rotation observations, enabling a better understanding of the role of magnetic fields in molecular cloud dynamics and star formation.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Supernova Observations with the CSST: I. Photometric Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST, also known as Xuntian) is a serviceable two-meter-aperture wide-field telescope operating in the same orbit as the China Space Station. The CSST plans to survey a sky area of 17,500 deg$^2$ of the medium-to-high Galactic latitude to a depth of 25-26 AB mag in at least 6 photometric bands over 255-1000 nm. Within such a large sky area, slitless spectra will also be taken over the same wavelength range as the imaging survey. Even though the CSST survey is not dedicated to time-domain studies, it would still detect a large number of transients, such as supernovae (SNe). In this paper, we simulate photometric SN observations based on a strawman survey plan using the Sncosmo package. During its 10-year survey, the CSST is expected to observe about 5 million SNe of various types. With quality cuts, we obtain a "gold" sample that comprises roughly 7,400 SNe Ia, 2,200 SNe Ibc, and 6,500 SNe II candidates with correctly classified percentages reaching 91%, 63%, and 93% (formally defined as classification precision), respectively. The same survey can also trigger alerts for the detection of about 15,500 SNe Ia (precision 61%) and 2,100 SNe II (precision 49%) candidates at least two days before the light maxima. Moreover, the near-ultraviolet observations of the CSST will be able to catch hundreds of shock-cooling events serendipitously every year. These results demonstrate that the CSST can make a potentially significant contribution to SN studies.</description>

      <title>LAMA: LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectral Analysis Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has obtained more than 23 million spectra, opening an unprecedented opportunity to study stellar physics, as well as the formation and evolution of our Milky Way. In order to obtain the accurate stellar parameters, we develop a LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectral Analysis Pipeline (LAMA), which estimates the stellar parameters from the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra, including the effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (logg), metallicity ([Fe/H]), radial velocity, and rotational velocity (vsini). LAMA estimates these parameters utilizing the template-matching method. The comparison between our results and those from the high-resolution ones, including APOGEE, GALAH, and PASTEL, shows no obvious bias, indicating the reliability of our results. The accuracy of Teff and [Fe/H] can reach 75 K and 0.12 dex, respectively, for the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS) spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10. For dwarfs, the uncertainty of logg is around 0.17 dex, while, for giants, it ranges from 0.18 to 0.30 dex, with the errors decreasing as logg increases. Using LAMA for the LAMOST-MRS spectra, we estimate the stellar parameters of 497,412 stars. This sample will be very helpful for investigating the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Approach for composition measurement of cosmic rays using the muon-to-electron ratio observed by LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composition measurement of cosmic rays (CRs) around the knee of the CR energy spectrum is crucial for studying the processes of particle acceleration and propagation of Galactic CRs. The Square Kilometer Array (KM2A) of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) can provide precise measurement of the muonic and electromagnetic (em.) components in CR-induced extensive air showers, and hence a good chance to disentangle the CR composition. Here we propose an approach of decomposing CR compositions with the number ratio between muons and em. particles ($N_{\mu}$/$N_{\rm e}$) observed by LHAASO-KM2A: we reconstruct the energy spectra of individual CR compositions by fitting $N_{\mu}$/$N_{\rm e}$ distributions in each reconstructed energy bin using the template shapes of $N_{\mu}$/$N_{\rm e}$ distributions of individual CR compositions based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We evaluate the performance of this approach with MC tests where mock data of LHAASO-KM2A are generated by MC simulation. We show that the input composition model can be well recovered in this approach, independent of the CR composition model adopted in the MC simulation for the template distributions. The uncertainties of the reconstructed spectra at &lt; 20 PeV, mainly limited by simulation statistics, are $\le$ 7% for proton, He, and Fe groups, and $\le$ 8% and $\le$ 16% for CNO and MgAlSi groups, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prospects of constraining on the polarizations of gravitational waves from binary black holes using space- and ground-based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, gravitational waves (GWs) exhibit two tensor modes, while alternative theories predict up to six polarization modes. We investigate GW polarization constraints using a model-independent parametrized post-Einsteinian framework with space- and ground-based detectors. Evaluating LISA, Taiji, TianQin, LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and Einstein Telescope (ET), we analyze their capabilities and network performance. Taiji provides the best constraints among space-based detectors, with LISA outperforming TianQin. Among ground-based detectors, LIGO excels in vector modes, while ET offers the most comprehensive constraints. In network scenarios, LISA+TJm performs best, and ET surpasses second-generation detector combinations. Multiband observations alleviate scalar mode degeneracies, significantly enhancing ground-based detector performance. Combined space- and ground-based observations yield robust constraints on GW polarization, advancing tests of deviations from general relativity. Our findings highlight the potential of future GW missions to refine our understanding of gravitational physics through precise polarization measurements.</description>

      <title>Enhancing gravitational-wave host localization with SKYFAST: rapid volume and inclination angle reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific impact of GW170817 strongly supports the need for an efficient electromagnetic follow-up campaign to gravitational-wave event candidates. The success of such campaigns depends critically on a fast and accurate localization of the source. In this paper, we present SKYFAST, a new pipeline for rapid localization of gravitational-wave event hosts. SKYFAST runs alongside a full parameter estimation (PE) algorithm, from which posterior samples are taken. It uses these samples to reconstruct an analytical posterior for the sky position, luminosity distance, and inclination angle using a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model, a Bayesian non-parametric method. This approach allows us to provide an accurate localization of the event using only a fraction of the total samples produced by the full PE analysis. Depending on the PE algorithm employed, this can lead to significant time savings, which is crucial for identifying the electromagnetic counterpart. Additionally, in a few minutes, SKYFAST generates a ranked list of the most probable galaxy hosts from a galaxy catalog of choice. This list includes information on the inclination angle posterior conditioned to the position of each candidate host, which is useful for assessing the detectability of gamma-ray burst structured jet emissions.</description>

      <title>Predicting dark matter halo masses from simulated galaxy images and environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies are theorized to form and co-evolve with their dark matter halos, such that their stellar masses and halo masses should be well-correlated. However, it is not known whether other observable galaxy features, such as their morphologies or large-scale environments, can be used to tighten the correlation between galaxy properties and halo masses. In this work, we train a baseline random forest model to predict halo mass using galaxy features from the Illustris TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, and compare with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) trained respectively using galaxy image cutouts and galaxy point clouds. The best baseline model has a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.310 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.220, compared to the CNN (RSME=0.359, MAE=0.238), GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.158), and a novel combined CNN+GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.144). The CNN is likely limited by our small data set, and we anticipate that the CNN and CNN+GNN would benefit from training on larger cosmological simulations. We conclude that deep learning models can leverage information from galaxy appearances and environment, beyond commonly used summary statistics, in order to better predict the halo mass.</description>

      <title>Challenge of direct imaging of exoplanets within structures: disentangling real signal from point source from background light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high contrast and spatial resolution requirements for directly imaging exoplanets requires effective coordination of wavefront control, coronagraphy, observation techniques, and post-processing algorithms. However, even with this suite of tools, identifying and retrieving exoplanet signals embedded in resolved scattered light regions can be extremely challenging due to the increased noise from scattered light off the circumstellar disk and the potential misinterpretation of the true nature of the detected signal. This issue pertains not only to imaging terrestrial planets in habitable zones within zodiacal and exozodiacal emission but also to young planets embedded in circumstellar, transitional, and debris disks. This is particularly true for H{\alpha} detection of exoplanets in transitional disks. This work delves into recent H{\alpha} observations of three transitional disks systems with MagAO-X, an extreme adaptive optics system for the 6.5-meter Magellan Clay telescope. We employed angular differential imaging (ADI) and simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) in combination with KLIP, a PCA algorithm in post-processing, for optimal starlight suppression and quasi-static noise removal. We discuss the challenges in protoplanet identification with MagAO-X in environments rich with scattered and reflected light from disk structures and explore a potential solution for removing noise contributions from real astronomical objects with current observation and post-processing techniques.</description>

      <title>E(2)-Equivariant Features in Machine Learning for Morphological Classification of Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growth of data from new radio telescope facilities, machine-learning approaches to the morphological classification of radio galaxies are increasingly being utilised. However, while widely employed deep-learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equivariant to translations within images, neither CNNs nor most other machine-learning approaches are equivariant to additional isometries of the Euclidean plane, such as rotations and reflections. Recent work has attempted to address this by using G-steerable CNNs, designed to be equivariant to a specified subset of 2-dimensional Euclidean, E(2), transformations. Although this approach improved model performance, the computational costs were a recognised drawback. Here we consider the use of directly extracted E(2)-equivariant features for the classification of radio galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the use of Minkowski functionals (MFs), Haralick features (HFs) and elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs). We show that, while these features do not perform equivalently well to CNNs in terms of accuracy, they are able to inform the classification of radio galaxies, requiring ~50 times less computational runtime. We demonstrate that MFs are the most informative, EFDs the least informative, and show that combinations of all three result in only incrementally improved performance, which we suggest is due to information overlap between feature sets.</description>

      <title>LADDER: Revisiting the Cosmic Distance Ladder with Deep Learning Approaches and Exploring its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of reconstructing the ''cosmic distance ladder'' of the Universe using a novel deep learning framework called LADDER - Learning Algorithm for Deep Distance Estimation and Reconstruction. LADDER is trained on the apparent magnitude data from the Pantheon Type Ia supernovae compilation, incorporating the full covariance information among data points, to produce predictions along with corresponding errors. After employing several validation tests with a number of deep learning models, we pick LADDER as the best performing one. We then demonstrate applications of our method in the cosmological context, including serving as a model-independent tool for consistency checks for other datasets like baryon acoustic oscillations, calibration of high-redshift datasets such as gamma ray bursts, and use as a model-independent mock catalog generator for future probes. Our analysis advocates for careful consideration of machine learning techniques applied to cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>Simulation of radio signals from cosmic-ray cascades in air and ice as observed by in-ice Askaryan radio detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino observatories will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Fitting Eclipse Maps of Exoplanets with Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping uses the shape of the eclipse of an exoplanet to measure its two-dimensional structure. Light curves are mostly composed of longitudinal information, with the latitudinal information only contained in the brief ingress and egress of the eclipse. This imbalance can lead to a spuriously confident map, where the longitudinal structure is constrained by out-of-eclipse data and the latitudinal structure is wrongly determined by the priors on the map. We present a new method to address this issue. The method tests for the presence of an eclipse mapping signal by using k-fold cross-validation to compare the performance of a simple mapping model to the null hypothesis of a uniform disk. If a signal is found, the method fits a map with more degrees of freedom, optimising its information content. The information content is varied by penalising the model likelihood by a factor proportional to the spatial entropy of the map, optimised by cross-validation. We demonstrate this method for simulated datasets then apply it to three observational datasets. The method identifies an eclipse mapping signal for JWST MIRI/LRS observations of WASP-43b but does not identify a signal for JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of WASP-18b or Spitzer Space Telescope observations of HD 189733b. It is possible to fit eclipse maps to these datasets, but we suggest that these maps are overfitting the eclipse shape. We fit a new map with more spatial freedom to the WASP-43b dataset and show a flatter east-west structure than previously derived.</description>

      <title>Roman FFP Revolution: Two, Three, Many Plutos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roman microlensing stands at a crossroads between its originally charted path of cataloging a population of cool planets that has subsequently become well-measured down to super-Earths, and the path of free-floating planets (FFPs), which did not exist when Roman was chosen in 2010, but by now promises revolutionary insights into planet formation and evolution via their possible connection to a spectrum of objects spanning 18 decades in mass. Until now, it was not even realized that the 2 paths are in conflict: Roman strategy was optimized for bound-planet detections, and FFPs were considered only in the context of what could be learned about them given this strategy. We derive a simple equation that mathematically expresses this conflict and explains why the current approach severely depresses detection of 2 of the 5 decades of potential FFP masses, i.e., exactly the two decades, $M_{\rm Pluto}&lt; M &lt;2\,M_{\rm Mars}$, that would tie terrestrial planets to the proto-planetary material out of which they formed. FFPs can be either truly free floating or can be bound in "Wide", "Kuiper", and "Oort" orbits, whose separate identification will allow further insight into planet formation. In the (low-mass) limit that the source radius is much bigger than the Einstein radius, $\theta_*\gg\theta_{\rm E}$, the number of significantly magnified points on the FFP light curve is $N=2\Gamma\theta_*\sqrt{1-z^2}/\mu$ --&gt; 3.0, when normalized to the adopted Roman cadence $\Gamma=4/$hr, and to source radius $\theta_*=0.3\,\mu$as, lens-source proper motion $\mu=6\,$mas/yr, and source impact parameter $z=0.5$, which are all typical values. By contrast $N=6$ are needed for an FFP detection. Thus, unless $\Gamma$ is doubled, FFP detection will be driven into the (large-$\theta_*$, small-$\mu$) corner of parameter space, reducing the detections by a net factor of 2 and cutting off the lowest-mass FFPs.</description>
