      <title>The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Lorentzian Calder\'on problems with data on disjoint sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the restricted Dirichlet-to-Neumann map $\Lambda^{U,V}_{g,A,q}$ for the wave equation with magnetic potential $A$ and scalar potential $q$, on an admissible Lorentzian manifold $(M, g)$ of dimension $n \geq 3$ with boundary. Here $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open subsets of $\partial M$, where we impose the Dirichlet data on $U$ and measure the Neumann-type data on $V$. We use the gliding rays and microlocal analysis to show that, without any a priori information, one can reconstruct the conformal class of the boundary metric $g|_{T\partial M \times T\partial M}$ and the magnetic potential $A|_{T\partial M}$ at recoverable boundary points from $\Lambda^{U,V}_{g,A,q}$. In particular, the conformal factor and the jet of the metric at those points are determined up to gauge transformations. Moreover, if the metric and the time orientation are known on $U$ (or $V$), then the metric on a larger portion of $V$ (or $U$) can be reconstructed, up to gauge.</description>

      <title>An extension of the $r^p$ method for wave equations with scale-critical potentials and first-order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r^p$ method, first introduced in [DR10], has become a robust strategy to prove decay for wave equations in the context of black holes and beyond. In this note, we propose an extension of this method, which is particularly suitable for proving decay for a general class of wave equations featuring a scale-critical time-dependent potential and/or first-order terms of small amplitude. Our approach consists of absorbing error terms in the $r^p$-weighted energy using a novel Gr\"{o}nwall argument, which allows a larger range of $p$ than the standard method. A spherically symmetric version of our strategy first appeared in [VdM22] in the context of a weakly charged scalar field on a black hole whose equations also involve a scale-critical potential.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation with smooth but otherwise unconstrained initial conditions are constructed, to solve the Millennium fluids problem in the positive. The smooth solutions are the mean values of general weak solutions and are alternately characterized as the entropy production minimizing solutions. The construction occurs in a finite periodic cube.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will consider $E$-type singularities which are Arnol'd type. We provide invariant conditions for a sufficiently smooth functions to have singularities of type $E_k (6\le k\le 8)$. We show the functions can be reduced to $E_k, k=6, 7, 8$ type normal form under some certain conditions. Moreover, we show that result on normal form for sufficiently smooth functions can be showed by the use of Implicit Function Theorem. The results can be utilized to investigate oscillatory integrals with sufficiently smooth phase function.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Boltzmann equation under shear heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spatially homogeneous inelastic Boltzmann equation for the angular cutoff pseudo-Maxwell molecules with an additional term of linear deformation. We establish the existence of non-Maxwellian self-similar profiles under the assumption of small deformation in the nearly elastic regime, and also obtain weak convergence to these self-similar profiles for global-in-time solutions with initial data that have finite mass and finite \( p \)-th order moment for any $2&lt;p\leq 4$. Our results confirm the competition between shear heating and inelastic cooling that governs the large time behavior of temperature. Specifically, temperature increases to infinity if shear heating dominates, decreases to zero if inelastic cooling prevails, and converges to a positive constant if the two effects are balanced. In the balanced scenario, the corresponding self-similar profile aligns with the steady solution.</description>

      <title>Wolff potential estimates for elliptic obstacle problems with generalized Orlicz growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates elliptic obstacle problems with generalized Orlicz growth involving measure data, which includes Orlicz growth, variable exponent growth, and double-phase growth as specific cases of this setting. First, we establish the existence of solutions in the Musielak-Orlicz space. Then, we derive pointwise and oscillation gradient estimates for solutions in terms of the non-linear Wolff potentials, assuming minimal conditions on the obstacle. These estimates subsequently lead to $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity results for the solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence and local uniqueness of multi-spike solutions for Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem with prescribed mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem with prescribed $ L^2$-norm (mass) constraint:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u=|u|^{2^*-2} u +\lambda_\rho u\quad \text { in } \Omega,
  u&gt;0, \quad u \in H_0^1(\Omega), \quad \int_{\Omega} u^2dx=\rho,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  where $N \geqslant 6$, $2^*=2 N /(N-2)$ is the critical Sobolev exponent, $\rho&gt;0$ is a given small constant and $\lambda_\rho&gt;0$ acts as an Euler-Lagrange multiplier. For any $k\in \mathbb{R}^+$, we construct a $k$-spike solutions in some suitable bounded domain $\Omega$. Our results extend those in \cite{BHG3,DGY,SZ}, where the authors obtained one or two positive solutions corresponding to the (local) minimizer or mountain pass type critical point for the energy functional of above equation. Furthermore, using blow-up analysis and local Pohozaev identities arguments, we prove that the $k$-spike solutions are locally unique. Compared to the standard Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem without the mass constraint, an additional difficulty arises in estimating the error caused by the differences in the Euler-Lagrange multipliers corresponding to different solutions. We overcome this difficulty by introducing novel observations and estimates related to the kernel of the linearized operators.</description>

      <title>Existence of a bi-radial sign-changing solution for Hardy-Sobolev-Mazya type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the following Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya type equation:
  \begin{equation}
  -\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N} u - \mu \frac{u}{|z|^2} = \frac{|u|^{q-2}u}{|z|^t}, \quad u \in D^{1,2} (\mathbb{R}^n),
  \end{equation}
  where $x = (y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^h \times \mathbb{R}^k = \mathbb{R}^n$, with $n \geq 5$, $2 &lt; k &lt;n$, and $t = n - \frac{(n-2)q}{2}$. We establish the existence of a bi-radial sign-changing solution under the assumptions $0 \leq \mu &lt; \frac{(k-2)^2}{4}, \, 2 &lt; q &lt;2^* = \frac{2(n-k+1)}{n-k-1}$. We approach the problem by lifting it to the hyperbolic setting, leading to the equation: $-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N} u \, - \, \lambda u = |u|^{p-1}u, \; u \in H^1(\mathbb{B}^N)$, $\mathbb{B}^N$ is the hyperbolic ball model. We study the existence of a sign-changing solution with suitable symmetry by constructing an appropriate invariant subspace of $H^1(\mathbb{B}^N)$ and applying the concentration compactness principle, and the corresponding solution of the Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya type equation becomes bi-radial under the corresponding isometry.</description>

      <title>Critical mass for finite-time chemotactic collapse in the critical dimension via comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Neumann initial-boundary value problem for the parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system, proposed by J\"ager and Luckhaus (1992). We confirm that their comparison methods can be simplified and refined, applicable to seek the critical mass $8\pi$ concerning finite-time blowup in the unit disk. As an application, we deal with a parabolic-elliptic-parabolic chemotaxis model involving indirect signal production in the unit ball of $\mathbb R^4$, proposed by Tao and Winkler (2025). Within the framework of radially symmetric solutions, we prove that if initial mass is less than $64\pi^2$, then solution is globally bounded; for any $m$ exceeding $64\pi^2$, there exist nonnegative initial data with prescribed mass $m$ such that the corresponding classical solutions exhibit a formation of Dirac-delta type singularity in finite time, termed a chemotactic collapse.</description>

      <title>Li-Yau Estimates and Harnack Inequalities for Nonlinear Slow Diffusion Equations on a Smooth Metric Measure Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new gradient estimates and Harnack inequalities for positive solutions to nonlinear slow diffusion equations. The framework is that of a smooth metric measure space $(\mathscr M,g,d\mu)$ with invariant weighted measure $d\mu=e^{-\phi} dv_g$ and diffusion operator $\Delta_\phi=e^\phi {\rm div} (e^{-\phi} \nabla)$ -- the $\phi$-Laplacian. The nonlinear slow diffusion equation, then, for $x \in {\mathscr M}$ and $t&gt;0$, and fixed exponent $p&gt;1$, takes the form \begin{equation*} \partial_t u (x,t) - \Delta_\phi u^p (x,t) = \mathscr N (t,x,u(x,t)). \end{equation*} We assume that the metric tensor $g$ and potential $\phi$ are space-time dependent; hence the same is true of the usual metric and potential dependent differential operators and curvature tensors. The estimates are established under natural lower bounds on the Bakry-\'Emery $m$-Ricci curvature tensor and the time derivative of metric tensor. The curious interplay between geometry, nonlinearity and evolution and their influence on the estimates is at the centre of this investigation. The results here considerably extend and improve earlier results on slow diffusion equations. Several implication, special cases and corollaries are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of solutions to an elliptic inequality with rapid decay at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an elliptic differential inequality: $\vert \Delta u(x) \vert \le C_0(\YYYY^{-\gamma}\vert u(x)\vert + \YYYY^{-\theta}\vert \nabla u(x)\vert)$ in an exterior domain $\R^n \setminus \ooo{U}$, where $U$ is a simply connected bounded domain $U$, $x := (y,z) \in \R^n$ with $y \in \R^m$ and $z\in \R^{n-m}$ for given $m\in \{ 1, ..., n\}$, and $\gamma, \theta \in \R$ are constants. We assume that $u(x)$ decays with exponential rate in the $y$-coordinates and polynomial rate in the $z$-coordinates as $\vert x\vert \to \infty$. We prove that if decay rates of $u$ satisfy certain conditions related to the constants $\gamma, \theta \in \R$, then $u\equiv 0$ in $\UUUUU$. The key is a Carleman estimate with typical cut-off arguments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that viscosity solutions to the quadratic Hessian equation $$\sigma_2(D^2u) = 1$$ cannot touch a harmonic function on a minimal surface from below. This can be viewed as a form of strict $2$-convexity. We also prove an a priori interior $C^2$ estimate in terms of the $W^{2,\,p}$ norm, for any $p &gt; 2$. Finally, we discuss how these results rule out certain strategies for constructing counterexamples to regularity.</description>

      <title>The steady Navier-Stokes equations in a system of unbounded channels with sources and sinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid in a junction of unbounded channels with sources and sinks is modeled through the Navier-Stokes equations under inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. In contrast to many previous works, the domain is not assumed to be simply-connected and the fluxes are not assumed to be small. In this very general setting, we prove the existence of a solution with a uniformly bounded Dirichlet integral in every compact subset. This is a generalization of the classical Ladyzhenskaya-Solonnikov result obtained under the additional assumption of zero boundary conditions. For small data of the problem we also prove the unique solvability and attainability of Couette-Poiseuille flows at infinity. The main novelty of our approach is the proof of the corresponding Leray-Hopf-type inequality by Leray's reductio ad absurdum argument (since the standard Hopf cutoff extension procedure does not work for general boundary data). For this contradiction approach, we use some fine properties of weak solutions to the Euler system based on Morse-Sard-type theorems in Sobolev spaces obtained by Bourgain, Korobkov &amp; Kristensen.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion stacking in stray field-coupled ultrathin ferromagnetic multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the energy landscape of ferromagnetic multilayer
  heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions -- tiny whirls of
  spins with non-trivial topology -- in each magnetic layer. Such
  magnetic heterostructures have been recently pursued as possible
  hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions suitable for the
  next generation of low power information technologies and
  unconventional computing. The presence of stacked skyrmions in the
  adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system,
  whereby the induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing
  role. Starting with the micromagnetic modeling framework, we derive
  a general reduced energy functional for a fixed number of ultrathin
  ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular magnetocrystalline
  anisotropy. We next investigate this energy functional in the regime
  in which the energy is dominated by the intralayer exchange
  interaction and formally obtain a finite-dimensional description
  governed by the energy of a system of one skyrmion per layer as a
  function of the position, radius and the rotation angle of each of
  theses skyrmions. For the latter, we prove that energy minimizers
  exist for all fixed skyrmion locations. We then focus on the
  simplest case of stray field-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and
  completely characterize the energy minimizers. We show that the
  global energy minimizers exist and consist of two stray
  field-stabilized N\'eel skyrmions with antiparallel in-plane
  magnetization components. We also calculate the energy of two
  skyrmions of equal radius as a function of their separation
  distance.</description>

      <title>McKean-Vlasov equations and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with critical singular Lorentz kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and conditional uniqueness in the Krylov class for SDEs with singular divergence-free drifts in the endpoint critical Lorentz space $L^infinity(0,T; L^{d,infinity}(\mathbb{R}^d))$, $d \geq 2$, which particularly includes the 2D Biot-Savart law. The uniqueness result is shown to be optimal in dimensions $d\geq 3$ by constructing different martingale solutions in the case of supercritical Lorentz drifts. As a consequence, the well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with critical singular kernels is derived. In particular, this yields the uniqueness of the 2D vorticity Navier-Stokes equations even in certain supercritical-scaling spaces. Furthermore, we prove that the path laws of solutions to McKean-Vlasov equations with critical singular kernels form a nonlinear Markov process in the sense of McKean.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for stochastic neural field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness and long-time behavior of a general continuum neural field model with Gaussian noise on possibly unbounded domains. In particular, we give conditions for the existence of invariant probability measures by restricting the solution flow to an invariant subspace with a nonlocal metric. Under the assumption of a sufficiently large decay parameter relative to the noise intensity, the growth of the connectivity kernel, and the Lipschitz regularity of the activation function, we establish exponential ergodicity and exponential mixing of the associated Markovian Feller semigroup and the uniqueness of the invariant measure with second moments.</description>

      <title>Absence of real resonances of Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the resonances of Dirac operators by continuing meromorphically the truncated resolvent and to establish a result about their localization : a kind of Rellich Theorem. Firstly, we consider the case of the Dirac operator in an external field which is essentially bounded and compactly supported. Secondly, we consider the case of the MIT bag model outside a smooth and bounded obstacle. We finally perform an explicit computation of resonances of a unidimensional Dirac operator.</description>

Abstract: We extend several fundamental estimates regarding spectral multipliers for the free Laplacian on $\mathbb R^3$ to the case of perturbed Hamiltonians of the form $H=-\Delta+V$, where $V$ is a scalar real-valued potential.
  Results include sharp bounds for Mihlin multipliers, partial confirmation for a conjecture made in [BeGo3] about intertwining operators, a characterization of the twisted Hardy spaces that correspond to these perturbed Hamiltonians, Strichartz estimates, and maximum principles.</description>

      <title>Threshold property of a singular stationary solution for semilinear heat equations with exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N\ge 3$. We are concerned with a Cauchy problem of the semilinear heat equation \[ \begin{cases} \partial_tu-\Delta u=f(u), &amp; x\in\mathbb{R}^N,\ t&gt;0,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x), &amp; x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \end{cases} \] where $f(0)=0$, $f$ is nonnegative, increasing and convex, $\log f(u)$ is convex for large $u&gt;0$ and some additional assumptions are assumed. We establish a positive radial singular stationary solution $u^*$ such that $u^*(x)\to\infty$ as $|x|\to 0$. Then, we prove the following: The problem has a nonnegative global-in-time solution if $0\le u_0\le u^*$ and $u_0\not\equiv u^*$, while the problem has no nonnegative local-in-time solutions if $u_0\ge u^*$ and $u_0\not\equiv u^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of positive singular solutions for a system of partial differential equations on a bounded domain \begin{equation} \label{main equation of the thesis} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta u = (1+\kappa_1(x)) | \nabla v |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ -\Delta v = (1+\kappa_2(x)) | \nabla u |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ u = v = 0 &amp; \text{on}~~ \partial B_1. \end{array} \right. \end{equation} We investigate the existence of positive singular solutions within $B_1$, the unit ball centered at the origin in $ \mathbb{R}^N $, under the conditions $ N \geq 3 $ and $\frac{N}{N-1} &lt; p &lt; 2 $. Additionally, we assume that $ \kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are non-negative, continuous functions satisfying $\kappa_1(0) = \kappa_2(0) = 0$ . Our system is an extension of the PDE equation studied by Aghajani et al. (2021) under similar assumptions.</description>

      <title>Threshold, subthreshold and global unbounded solutions of superlinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation with a superlinear nonlinearity and we study the properties of threshold or subthreshold solutions, lying on or below the boundary between blow-up and global existence, respectively. For the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem, we prove the boundedness of any subthreshold solution. This implies, in particular, that all global unbounded solutions -- if they exist -- are threshold solutions. For the Cauchy problem, these properties fail in general but we show that they become true for a suitably modified notion of threshold. Our results strongly improve known results even in the model case of power nonlinearities, especially in the Sobolev critical and supercritical cases.</description>

      <title>Input-to-state type Stability for Simplified Fluid-Particle Interaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness and the input-to-state type stability of a one-dimensional fluid-particle interaction system. A distinctive feature, not yet considered in the ISS literature, is that our system involves a free boundary. More precisely, the fluid is described by the viscous Burgers equation, and the motion of the particle obeys Newton second law. The point mass is subject to both a feedback control and an open-loop control. We first establish the well-posedness of the system for any open-loop input in the L2(0, infinity) space. Assuming the input also belongs to the L1(0,infinity) space, we prove that the particle's position remains uniformly bounded and that the system is input-to-state type stable. The proof is based on the construction of a Lyapunov functional derived from a special test function.</description>

      <title>FEM for 1D-problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian: error estimates and numerical implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the numerical analysis of a finite element method (FEM) for one-dimensional Dirichlet problems involving the logarithmic Laplacian (the pseudo-differential operator that appears as a first-order expansion of the fractional Laplacian as the exponent $s\to 0^+$). Our analysis exhibits new phenomena in this setting; in particular, using recently obtained regularity results, we prove rigorous error estimates and provide a logarithmic order of convergence in the energy norm using suitable $\log$-weighted spaces. Moreover, we show that the stiffness matrix of logarithmic problems can be obtained as the derivative of the fractional stiffness matrix evaluated at $s=0$. Lastly, we investigate the relationship between the discrete eigenvalue problem and its convergence to the continuous one.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Stochastic Evolution Equations in the Critical Variational Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the weak convergence approach, we prove the large deviation principle (LDP) for solutions to quasilinear stochastic evolution equations with small Gaussian noise in the critical variational setting, a recently developed general variational framework. No additional assumptions are made apart from those required for well-posedness. In particular, no monotonicity is required, nor a compact embedding in the Gelfand triple. Moreover, we allow for flexible growth of the diffusion coefficient, including gradient noise. This leads to numerous applications for which the LDP was not established yet, in particular equations on unbounded domains with gradient noise. Since our framework includes the 2D Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations with gradient noise and unbounded domains, our results resolve an open problem that has remained unsolved for over 15 years.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically non-negative Ricci curvature, elliptic Kato constant and isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ABP method for proving isoperimetric inequalities has been first employed by Cabr\'e in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then developed by Brendle, notably in the context of non-compact Riemannian manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature and positive asymptotic volume ratio. In this paper, we expand upon their approach and prove isoperimetric inequalities (sharp in the limit) in the presence of a small amount of negative curvature. First, we consider smallness of the negative part $\mathrm{Ric}_-$ of the Ricci curvature in terms of its elliptic Kato constant. Indeed, the Kato constant turns out to control the non-negativity of the ($\infty$-)Bakry-\'Emery Ricci-tensor of a suitable conformal deformation of the manifold, and the ABP method can be implemented in this setting. Secondly, we show that the smallness of the Kato constant is ensured provided that the asymptotic volume ratio is positive and either $M$ has one end and asymptotically non-negative sectional curvature, or there is a suitable polynomial decay of $\mathrm{Ric}_{-}$, and the relative volume comparison condition known as $\textbf{(VC)}$ holds. To show this latter fact, we enhance techniques elaborated by Li-Tam and Kasue to obtain new estimates of the Green function valid on the whole manifold.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Gauges and Regularity for Stationary Weak Yang$-$Mills Connections in Supercritical Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that stationary Yang$-$Mills fields in dimensions 5 belonging to the variational class of weak connections are smooth away from a closed singular set $S$ of vanishing 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Our proof is based on an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem, which generalizes to this class of weak connections the existing previous $\varepsilon$-regularity results by G. Tian for smooth connections, by Y. Meyer and the second author for Sobolev and approximable connections, and by T. Tao and G. Tian for admissible connections (which are weak limits of smooth Yang$-$Mills fields). On the path towards establishing $\varepsilon$-regularity, a pivotal step is the construction of controlled Coulomb gauges for general weak connections under small Morrey norm assumptions.</description>
