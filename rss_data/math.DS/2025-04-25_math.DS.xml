      <title>An Exact SIR Series Solution and an Exploration of the Related Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convergent power series solution is obtained for the SIR model, using an asymptotically motivated gauge function. For certain choices of model parameter values, the series converges over the full physical domain (i.e., for all positive time). Furthermore, the radius of convergence as a function of nondimensionalized initial susceptible and infected populations is obtained via a numerical root test.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian modeling of rigid multibody systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a port-Hamiltonian approach to model nonlinear rigid multibody systems subject to both position and velocity constraints. Our formulation accommodates Cartesian and redundant coordinates, respectively, and captures kinematic as well as gyroscopic effects. The resulting equations take the form of nonlinear differential-algebraic equations that inherently preserve an energy balance. We show that the proposed class is closed under interconnection, and we provide several examples to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Conley-Morse persistence barcode: a homological signature of a combinatorial bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bifurcation is one of the major topics in the theory of dynamical systems. It characterizes the nature of qualitative changes in parametrized dynamical systems. In this work, we study combinatorial bifurcations within the framework of combinatorial multivector field theory--a young but already well-established theory providing a combinatorial model for continuous-time dynamical systems (or simply, flows). We introduce Conley-Morse persistence barcode, a compact algebraic descriptor of combinatorial bifurcations. The barcode captures structural changes in a dynamical system at the level of Morse decompositions and provides a characterization of the nature of observed transitions in terms of the Conley index. The construction of Conley-Morse persistence barcode builds upon ideas from topological data analysis (TDA). Specifically, we consider a persistence module obtained from a zigzag filtration of topological pairs (formed by index pairs defining the Conley index) over a poset. Using gentle algebras, we prove that this module decomposes into simple intervals (bars) and compute them with algorithms from TDA known for processing zigzag filtrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a closed oriented Riemannian surface, and let $SM$ be its unit tangent bundle. We show that the interior in the $\mathcal{C}^2$ topology of the set of smooth functions $\lambda:SM\to \mathbb{R}$ for which the thermostat $(M, g, \lambda)$ has no conjugate points is a subset of those functions for which the thermostat is projectively Anosov. Moreover, we prove that if a reversible thermostat is projectively Anosov, then its non-wandering set contains no conjugate points.</description>

      <title>On the local stability of the elapsed-time model in terms of the transmission delay and interconnection strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elapsed-time model describes the behavior of interconnected neurons through the time since their last spike. It is an age-structured non-linear equation in which age corresponds to the elapsed time since the last discharge, and models many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions between neurons. We investigate the linearized stability of this equation by considering a discrete delay, which accounts for the possibility of a synaptic delay due to the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the rest of the ensemble. We state a stability criterion that allows to determine if a steady state is linearly stable or unstable depending on the delay and the interaction between neurons. Our approach relies on the study of the asymptotic behavior of related Volterra-type integral equations in terms of theirs Laplace transforms. The analysis is complemented with numerical simulations illustrating the change of stability of a steady state in terms of the delay and the intensity of interconnections.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of shrinking targets on Przytycki-Urba\'nski fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shrinking target problems in the context of iterated function systems have received an increasing amount of interest in the past few years. The classical shrinking target problem concerns points returning infinitely many times to a sequence of shrinking balls. In the iterated function system context, the shrinking balls problem is only well tractable in the case of similarity maps, but the case of affine maps is more elusive due to many geometric-dynamical complications.
  In the current work, we push through these complications and compute the Hausdorff dimension of a set recurring to a shrinking target of geometric balls in some affine iterated function systems. For these results, we have pinpointed a representative class of affine iterated function systems, consisting of a pair of diagonal affine maps, that was introduced by Przytycki and Urba\'nski. The analysis splits into many sub-cases according to the type of the centre point of the targets, and the relative sizes of the targets and the contractions of the maps, illustrating the array of challenges of going beyond affine maps with nice projections. The proofs require heavy machinery from, and expand, the theory of Bernoulli convolutions.</description>

      <title>On systems disjoint from all minimal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, G\'{o}rska, Lema\'{n}czyk, and de la Rue characterized the class of automorphisms disjoint from all ergodic automorphisms. Inspired by their work, we provide several characterizations of systems that are disjoint from all minimal systems.
  For a topological dynamical system $(X,T)$, it is disjoint from all minimal systems if and only if there exist minimal subsets $(M_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ of $X$ whose union is dense in $X$ and each of them is disjoint from $X$ (we also provide a measure-theoretical analogy of the result). For a semi-simple system $(X,T)$, it is disjoint from all minimal systems if and only if there exists a dense $G_{\delta}$ set $\Omega$ in $X \times X$ such that for every pair $(x_1,x_2) \in \Omega$, the subsystems $\overline{\mathcal{O}}(x_1,T)$ and $\overline{\mathcal{O}}(x_2,T)$ are disjoint. Furthermore, for a general system a characterization similar to the ergodic case is obtained.</description>

      <title>Auerbach bases, projection constants, and the joint spectral radius of principal submatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that compact sets of complex matrices can always be brought, via similarity transformation, into a form where all matrix entries are bounded in absolute value by the joint spectral radius (JSR). The key tool for this is that every extremal norm of a matrix set admits an Auerbach basis; any such basis gives rise to a desired coordinate system. An immediate implication is that all diagonal entries - equivalently, all one-dimensional principal submatrices - are uniformly bounded above by the JSR. It is shown that the corresponding bounding property does not hold for higher dimensional principal submatrices. More precisely, we construct finite matrix sets for which, across the entire similarity orbit, the JSRs of all higher-dimensional principal submatrices exceed that of the original set. This shows that the bounding result does not extend to submatrices of dimension greater than one. The constructions rely on tools from the geometry of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, with projection constants of norms playing a key role. Additional bounds of the JSR of principal submatrices are obtained using John's ellipsoidal approximation and known estimates for projection constants.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of mixing and rigid behaviors in ergodic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and explore the notion of rigidity group, associated with a collection of finitely many sequences, and show that this concept has many, somewhat surprising characterizations of algebraic, spectral, and unitary nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these characterizations can be employed to obtain various results in the theory of generic Lebesgue-preserving automorphisms of $[0,1]$, IP-ergodic theory, multiple recurrence, additive combinatorics, and spectral theory. As a consequence of one of our results we show that given $(b_1,...b_\ell)\in\mathbb N^\ell$, there is no orthogonal vector $(a_1,\dots,a_\ell)\in\mathbb Z^\ell$ with some $|a_j|=1$ if and only if there is an increasing sequence of natural numbers $(n_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$ with the property that for each $F\subseteq \{1,...,\ell\}$ there is a $\mu$-preserving transformation $T_F:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]$ ($\mu$ denotes the Lebesgue measure) such that for any measurable $A,B\subseteq [0,1]$, $$\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\mu(A\cap T_F^{-b_jn_k}B)=\begin{cases} \mu(A\cap B),\,\text{ if }j\in F,\\ \mu(A)\mu(B),\,\text{ if }j\not\in F. \end{cases}$$ We remark that this result has a natural extension to a wide class of families of sequences.</description>

      <title>A common first integral from three-body secular theory and Kepler billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that a particular first integral of the partially-averaged system in the secular theory of the three-body problem appears also as an important conserved quantity of integrable Kepler billiards. In this note we illustrate their common roots with the projective dynamics of the two-center problem. We then combine these two aspects to define a class of integrable billiard systems on surfaces of constant curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. In this paper, we unify the five conditions into only one degeneracy condition. This allows for a simpler definition of Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse-Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex. As a result, we obtain another proof of the Morse Homology Theorem.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation in ODE Models with Certified Polynomial System Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider dynamical models given by rational ODE systems. Parameter estimation is an important and challenging task of recovering parameter values from observed data. Recently, a method based on differential algebra and rational interpolation was proposed to express parameter estimation in terms of polynomial system solving. Typically, polynomial system solving is a bottleneck, hence the choice of the polynomial solver is crucial. In this contribution, we compare two polynomial system solvers applied to parameter estimation: homotopy continuation solver from HomotopyContinuation.jl and our new implementation of a certified solver based on rational univariate representation (RUR) and real root isolation. We show how the new RUR solver can tackle examples that are out of reach for the homotopy methods and vice versa.</description>

      <title>No infinite spin for partial collisions converging to isolated central configurations on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $n$-body problem, when a~cluster of bodies tends to a collision, then its normalized shape curve converges to the set of normalized central configurations, which has $SO(2)$ symmetry in the planar case. This leaves a possibility that the normalized shape curve tends to the circle obtained by rotation of some central configuration instead of a particular point on it. This is the \emph{infinite spin problem} which concerns the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the $n$-body problem. The question also makes sense for partial collision.
  We show that the infinite spin is not possible if the limiting circle is isolated from other connected components of the set of normalized central configurations. Our approach extends the method from recent work for total collision by Moeckel and Montgomery, which was based on a combination of the center manifold theorem with {\L}ojasiewicz inequality. To that we add a shadowing result for pseudo-orbits near normally hyperbolic manifold and careful estimates on the influence of other bodies on the cluster of colliding bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological entropy of operators. More precisely, in the Banach space setting, we show that compact operators have finite entropy, which depends solely on their point spectrum. Moreover, for operators on \(F\)-spaces, we explore the relationship between the specification property and entropy. In particular, we show that the specification property implies infinite topological entropy, while the operator specification property implies positive entropy. We also show that the invariance principle fails for the class of compact operators.</description>

      <title>Stability of travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations driven by additive noise with H\"older continuous paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst index. We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and H\"older exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with H\"older continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, the difference of Hurst index to H\"older exponent influences the size of scaling exponents of the noise amplitude that are sufficient to ensure stability.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Block Pillar Structure in the Kolakoski Sequence K(1,3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolakoski sequence K(1,3) over {1, 3} is known to be structured, unlike K(1,2), with symbol frequency d approx. 0.397 linked to the Pisot number alpha (real root of x^3 - 2x^2 - 1 = 0). We reveal an explicit nested recursion defining block sequences B(n) and pillar sequences P(n) via B(n+1) = B(n) P(n) B(n) and P(n+1) = G(R(P(n)), 3), where G generates runs from vector R(P(n)). We prove B(n) are prefixes of K(1,3) converging to it, and B(n+1) = G(R(B(n)), 1), directly reflecting the Kolakoski self-encoding property. We derive recurrences for lengths |B(n)|, |P(n)| and symbol counts, confirming growth governed by alpha (limit |B(n+1)|/|B(n)| = alpha as n -&gt; infinity). If block/pillar densities converge, they must equal d. This constructive framework provides an alternative perspective on K(1,3)'s regularity, consistent with known results from substitution dynamics.</description>
