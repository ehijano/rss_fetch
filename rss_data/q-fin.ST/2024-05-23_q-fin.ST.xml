      <title>The puzzle of Carbon Allowance spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of contributions in the literature have identified a puzzle in the European carbon allowance (EUA) market. Specifically, a persistent cost-of-carry spread (C-spread) over the risk-free rate has been observed. We are the first to explain the anomalous C-spread with the credit spread of the corporates involved in the emission trading scheme. We obtain statistical evidence that the C-spread is cointegrated with both this credit spread and the risk-free interest rate. This finding has a relevant policy implication: the most effective solution to solve the market anomaly is including the EUA in the list of European Central Bank eligible collateral for refinancing operations. This change in the ECB monetary policy operations would greatly benefit the carbon market and the EU green transition.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Cryptocurrency Prices through a Path Dependent Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our focus lies on the Merton's jump diffusion model, employing jump processes characterized by the compound Poisson process. Our primary objective is to forecast the drift and volatility of the model using a variety of methodologies. We adopt an approach that involves implementing different drift, volatility, and jump terms within the model through various machine learning techniques, traditional methods, and statistical methods on price-volume data. Additionally, we introduce a path-dependent Monte Carlo simulation to model cryptocurrency prices, taking into account the volatility and unexpected jumps in prices.</description>

      <title>BERT vs GPT for financial engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper benchmarks several Transformer models [4], to show how these models can judge sentiment from a news event. This signal can then be used for downstream modelling and signal identification for commodity trading. We find that fine-tuned BERT models outperform fine-tuned or vanilla GPT models on this task. Transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and natural language generation. Among the most prominent transformer models are Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), which differ in their architectures and objectives.
  A CopBERT model training data and process overview is provided. The CopBERT model outperforms similar domain specific BERT trained models such as FinBERT. The below confusion matrices show the performance on CopBERT &amp; CopGPT respectively. We see a ~10 percent increase in f1_score when compare CopBERT vs GPT4 and 16 percent increase vs CopGPT. Whilst GPT4 is dominant It highlights the importance of considering alternatives to GPT models for financial engineering tasks, given risks of hallucinations, and challenges with interpretability. We unsurprisingly see the larger LLMs outperform the BERT models, with predictive power. In summary BERT is partially the new XGboost, what it lacks in predictive power it provides with higher levels of interpretability. Concluding that BERT models might not be the next XGboost [2], but represent an interesting alternative for financial engineering tasks, that require a blend of interpretability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Systematic Comparable Company Analysis and Computation of Cost of Equity using Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing cost of equity for private corporations and performing comparable company analysis (comps) for both public and private corporations is an integral but tedious and time-consuming task, with important applications spanning the finance world, from valuations to internal planning. Performing comps traditionally often times include high ambiguity and subjectivity, leading to unreliability and inconsistency. In this paper, I will present a systematic and faster approach to compute cost of equity for private corporations and perform comps for both public and private corporations using spectral and agglomerative clustering. This leads to a reduction in the time required to perform comps by orders of magnitude and entire process being more consistent and reliable.</description>

      <title>A novel portfolio construction strategy based on the core-periphery profile of stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper highlights the significance of mesoscale structures, particularly the core-periphery structure, in financial networks for portfolio optimization. We build portfolios of stocks belonging to the periphery part of the Planar maximally filtered subgraphs of the underlying network of stocks created from Pearson correlations between pairs of stocks and compare its performance with some well-known strategies of Pozzi et. al. hinging around the local indices of centrality in terms of the Sharpe ratio, returns and standard deviation. Our findings reveal that these portfolios consistently outperform traditional strategies and further the core-periphery profile obtained is statistically significant across time periods. These empirical findings substantiate the efficacy of using the core-periphery profile of the stock market network for both inter-day and intraday trading and provide valuable insights for investors seeking better returns.</description>

      <title>A K-means Algorithm for Financial Market Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial market risk forecasting involves applying mathematical models, historical data analysis and statistical methods to estimate the impact of future market movements on investments. This process is crucial for investors to develop strategies, financial institutions to manage assets and regulators to formulate policy. In today's society, there are problems of high error rate and low precision in financial market risk prediction, which greatly affect the accuracy of financial market risk prediction. K-means algorithm in machine learning is an effective risk prediction technique for financial market. This study uses K-means algorithm to develop a financial market risk prediction system, which significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of financial market risk prediction. Ultimately, the outcomes of the experiments confirm that the K-means algorithm operates with user-friendly simplicity and achieves a 94.61% accuracy rate</description>

      <title>Decision Trees for Intuitive Intraday Trading Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper aims to investigate the efficacy of decision trees in constructing intraday trading strategies using existing technical indicators for individual equities in the NIFTY50 index. Unlike conventional methods that rely on a fixed set of rules based on combinations of technical indicators developed by a human trader through their analysis, the proposed approach leverages decision trees to create unique trading rules for each stock, potentially enhancing trading performance and saving time. By extensively backtesting the strategy for each stock, a trader can determine whether to employ the rules generated by the decision tree for that specific stock. While this method does not guarantee success for every stock, decision treebased strategies outperform the simple buy-and-hold strategy for many stocks. The results highlight the proficiency of decision trees as a valuable tool for enhancing intraday trading performance on a stock-by-stock basis and could be of interest to traders seeking to improve their trading strategies.</description>

      <title>FinRobot: An Open-Source AI Agent Platform for Financial Applications using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As financial institutions and professionals increasingly incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows, substantial barriers, including proprietary data and specialized knowledge, persist between the finance sector and the AI community. These challenges impede the AI community's ability to enhance financial tasks effectively. Acknowledging financial analysis's critical role, we aim to devise financial-specialized LLM-based toolchains and democratize access to them through open-source initiatives, promoting wider AI adoption in financial decision-making.
  In this paper, we introduce FinRobot, a novel open-source AI agent platform supporting multiple financially specialized AI agents, each powered by LLM. Specifically, the platform consists of four major layers: 1) the Financial AI Agents layer that formulates Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by breaking sophisticated financial problems down into logical sequences; 2) the Financial LLM Algorithms layer dynamically configures appropriate model application strategies for specific tasks; 3) the LLMOps and DataOps layer produces accurate models by applying training/fine-tuning techniques and using task-relevant data; 4) the Multi-source LLM Foundation Models layer that integrates various LLMs and enables the above layers to access them directly. Finally, FinRobot provides hands-on for both professional-grade analysts and laypersons to utilize powerful AI techniques for advanced financial analysis. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Profit Potential: Maximizing Returns with Bayesian Optimization of Supertrend Indicator Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the atr multiplier and atr period -the parameters of the Supertrend indicator for maximizing trading profits across diverse stock datasets. By employing BO, the thesis aims to automate the identification of optimal parameter settings, leading to a more data-driven and potentially more profitable trading strategy compared to relying on manually chosen parameters. The effectiveness of the BO-optimized Supertrend strategy will be evaluated through backtesting on a variety of stock datasets.</description>

      <title>Large Skew-t Copula Models and Asymmetric Dependence in Intraday Equity Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skew-t copula models are attractive for the modeling of financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence. We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and Capitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A stochastic gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The methodology is used to estimate skew-t factor copula models with up to 15 factors for intraday returns from 2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in pairwise correlations. In a moving window study we show that the asymmetric dependencies also vary over time, and that intraday predictive densities from the skew-t copula are more accurate than those from benchmark copula models. Portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise asymmetric dependencies improve performance relative to the index.</description>
