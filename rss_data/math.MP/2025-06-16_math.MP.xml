      <title>On Universal Deformations of Compressible Cauchy Elastic Solids Reinforced by Inextensible Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal deformations are those that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and by applying only boundary tractions, for all materials within a given constitutive class. We study the universal deformations of compressible isotropic Cauchy elastic solids reinforced by a single family of inextensible fibers. We consider straight fibers parallel to the Cartesian Z-axis in the reference configuration and derive the universality constraints. The principal invariants of the right Cauchy-Green strain are functions of Z alone. When at least one principal invariant is not constant, the strain depends only on Z, with $C_{XZ} = C_{YZ} = 0$ and $C_{ZZ} = 1$, leaving three independent components: $C_{XX}$, $C_{XY}$, and $C_{YY}$. Determining universal deformations then reduces to ensuring compatibility, which is equivalent to requiring that the Ricci tensor vanishes. This yields a system of four second-order, nonlinear, coupled ordinary differential equations for the three unknown components. We fully solve this problem using Cartan's method of moving frames and obtain two families of universal deformations, referred to as Families Z1 and Z2, which are inhomogeneous and non-isochoric. If all three principal invariants are constant, the problem reduces to a system of nonlinear PDEs reminiscent of Ericksen's open problem. In addition to homogeneous deformations satisfying the Z-inextensibility constraint (Family Z0), a subset of Family 5 universal deformations of incompressible isotropic elasticity -- specifically those satisfying the inextensibility constraint -- are also universal for fiber-reinforced solids (Family 5Z). The complete solution of this case remains open. Finally, we show that the universal deformations for this class of Cauchy elastic solids are identical to those of the corresponding hyperelastic solids.</description>

      <title>Critical Ising correlations on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence of multi-point spin correlations in the critical Ising model on a torus. Via Pfaffian identities, this also implies convergence of other correlations, including correlations of spins with fermionic and energy observables. We obtain explicit formulae for the scaling limits in terms of theta functions, verifying the predictions in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>A remarkable dynamical symmetry of the Landau problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the dynamical group of an electron in a constant magnetic field is the group of symplectomorphisms $Sp(4,\mathbb{R})$. It is generated by the spinorial realization of the conformal algebra $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ considered in Dirac's seminal paper "A Remarkable Representation of the 3 + 2 de Sitter Group". The symplectic group $Sp(4,\mathbb{R})$ is the double covering of the conformal group $SO(2,3)$ of 2+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime which is in turn the dynamical group of a hydrogen atom in 2 space dimensions. The Newton-Hooke duality between the 2D hydrogen atom and the Landau problem is explained via the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction of the conformal symmetries of the Jordan algebra of real symmetric $2 \times 2$ matrices. The connection between the Landau problem and the 3D hydrogen atom is elucidated by the reduction of a Dirac spinor to a Majorana one in the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel spinorial regularization.</description>

      <title>A survey on geometric frameworks for action-dependent classical field theories and their relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive overview of three recently developed geometric frameworks for the study of classical action-dependent field theories. Specifically, the three underlying geometric structures - namely, k-contact, k-cocontact, and multicontact - are first introduced, and then used to develop the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of the aforementioned theories. Finally, the relationship among these three types of structures is analyzed in the case of trivial bundles; as well as the comparison with other alternative definitions of multicontact structure presented in the literature.</description>

      <title>A relation between k-symplectic and k-contact Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of partial differential equations which appear in classical field theories can be studied geometrically using different geometrical structures, for example, k-symplectic geometry, k-cosymplectic geometry, multisymplectic geometry, etc. In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the study of k-contact Hamiltonian systems. These are based on the description of the dynamics of field theories using the so-called k-contact manifolds. Such structures are generalizations of contact structures and k-symplectic structures. The relation between k-symplectic manifolds and k-contact manifolds was previoustly established. In light of the above relation, this work seeks to explore the relationship between k-symplectic Hamiltonian systems and k-contact Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>The metric from energy-momentum non-conservation: Generalizing Noether and completing spectral geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete the program of spectral geometry, in the sense that we show that a manifold's shape, i.e., its metric, can be reconstructed from its resonant sound when tapped lightly, i.e., from its spectrum, -- if in addition we also record the resonances' mutual excitation pattern when the driving is strong enough to reach the nonlinear regime. Applied to spacetime, this finding yields a generalization of Noether's theorem: the specific pattern of energy-momentum non-conservation on a generic curved spacetime, encoded within the quantum field theoretic scattering matrices, is sufficient to calculate the metric. Applied to quantum gravity, this shows that the conventional dichotomy of spacetime versus matter can emerge from an underlying information-theoretic framework of only one type of quantity: abstract correlators, $G^{(n)}$, that are, a priori, merely operators on $n$ tensor factors of a Hilbert space. This is because, on one hand, if abstract higher-order correlators $G^{(n&gt;2)}$ can be diagonalized, these correlators can be represented as local quantum field theoretic vertices on a curved spacetime whose metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ can be explicitly calculated. On the other hand, at sufficiently high energies, such as the Planck scale, the $G^{(n)}$ may not be even approximately representable as correlators of a local QFT on a spacetime, indicating a regime that is mathematically controlled but transcends the concepts of spacetime and matter.</description>

      <title>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Poisson-type problems with transmission conditions at boundaries of infinite metric trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Poisson-type problem on a mixed-dimensional structure combining a Euclidean domain and a lower-dimensional self-similar component touching a compact surface (interface). The lower-dimensional piece is a so-called infinite metric tree (one-dimensional branching structure), and the key ingredient of the study is a rigorous definition of the gluing conditions between the two components. These constructions are based on the recent concept of embedded trace maps and some abstract machineries derived from a suitable Green-type formula. The problem is then reduced to the study of Fredholm properties of a linear combination of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for the tree and the Euclidean domain, which yields desired existence and uniqueness results. One also shows that finite sections of tree can be used for an efficient approximation of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Ray Optics Approach to Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving the phase of a complex-valued field from the measurements of its amplitude is a crucial problem with a wide range of applications in microscopy and ultracold atomic physics. In particular, obtaining an accurate and efficient solution to this problem is a key step in shaping laser beams for trapping atoms in optical tweezer arrays and applying high-fidelity entangling gates on a neutral atom quantum computer. Current approaches to this problem fail to converge on the optimal solution due to a phenomenon known as vortex formation. In this work, we present an efficient optimization algorithm using Optimal Transport. Our approach completely bypasses the creation of phase vortices and allows for a state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we show a deep theoretical connection between the Optimal Transport plan and the ray-optics limit of the Wigner distribution of the unknown complex-valued field, and show that our method can be used to retrieve the phase-space transformation of any unknown quadratic phase system. Finally, we reinterpret this problem in the modern quantum learning framework. The techniques we develop provide both useful intuition and practical tools for advancing the frontiers of phase retrieval and laser beam shaping.</description>

      <title>On scattering for NLS: rigidity properties and numerical simulations via the lens transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the scattering operator associated with the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation which captures the evolution of solutions over an infinite time-interval under the nonlinear flow of this equation. The asymptotic nature of the scattering operator (involving unbounded time) makes its computation particularly challenging. We overcome this by exploiting the space-time compactification provided by the lens transform, marking the first use of this technique in numerical simulations. This results in a highly efficient and reliable methodology for computing the scattering operator in various regimes. In developing this approach we introduce and prove several new identities and theoretical properties of the scattering operator. We support our construction with several numerical experiments which we show to agree with known analytical properties of the scattering operator, and also address the case of long-range scattering for the one-dimensional cubic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Our simulations permit us to further explore regimes beyond current analytical understanding, and lead us to formulate new conjectures concerning fixed and rotating points of the operator, as well as its existence in the long-range setting for both defocusing and focusing cases.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new local Poisson bracket compatible with the second unconstrained Adler-Gelfand-Dickey bracket. The resulting bihamiltonian structure admits a dispersionless limit and the leading term defines a logarithmic Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold. Furthermore, we show that this Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold can be constructed on the orbits space of the standard representation of the permutation group.</description>

      <title>Extension Research of Principal Bundle Constraint System Theory on Ricci-flat K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the geometric mechanics theory of constraint systems on principal bundles from the flat connection case to the general situation with non-zero curvature. Based on the theoretical foundation of compatible pairs under strong transversality conditions and principal bundle constraint systems, we systematically study the behavior of compatible pair theory in non-flat geometry within the context of Ricci-flat K\"ahler manifolds. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that the fundamental framework of strong transversality conditions and compatible pairs possesses universality and does not depend on the flatness assumption of connections. Furthermore, we re-derive the dynamical connection equations incorporating curvature reaction terms and extend Spencer cohomology theory to a spectral sequence structure capable of precisely encoding curvature information. The research reveals the exact action mechanism of curvature $\Omega$: it plays a crucial role through the integrability condition $\text{ad}_\Omega^* \lambda = 0$ and higher-order differentials in Spencer cohomology, while maintaining the fundamental structure of the theoretical framework unchanged. This extension not only deepens the geometric coupling theory between constraint systems and gauge fields but also provides new mathematical tools for modern gauge field theory, string theory geometry, and related topological analysis, demonstrating the profound connections between constraint geometry and classical differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Entangled states from quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_h (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the application of the Jordanian quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_h (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$, as a Hopf algebra deformation of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$, in the context of entanglement properties of quantum states. For them, several kind of entanglement measures and fidelities are obtained, parametrized by the deformation parameter $h$. In particular, we construct the associated $h$-deformed Dicke states on $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$, comparing them to the $q$-Dicke states obtained from the quantum deformation of the $\mathcal U_q (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$. Moreover, the density matrices of these $h$-deformed Dicke states are compared to the experimental realizations of those of Dicke states. A similar behavior is observed, pointing out that the $h$-deformation could be used to describe noise and decoherence effects in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of two-dimensional determinantal processes associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a new class of determinantal point processes in the complex plane coming from the ground state of free fermions associated with Berezin--Toeplitz operators. These processes generalize the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory. We prove a two-term Szeg\H{o}-type asymptotic expansion for the Laplace transform of smooth linear statistics. This implies a law of large number and central limit theorem for the empirical field. The limiting variance includes both contributions from the bulk and boundary of the droplet. The boundary fluctuations depend on the Hamiltonian dynamics associated with the underlying operator and, generally, are not conformally invariant.</description>

      <title>Extremal Magic States from Symmetric Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic, a key quantum resource beyond entanglement, remains poorly understood in terms of its structure and classification. In this paper, we demonstrate a striking connection between high-dimensional symmetric lattices and quantum magic states. By mapping vectors from the $E_8$, $BW_{16}$, and $E_6$ lattices into Hilbert space, we construct and classify stabiliser and maximal magic states for two-qubit, three-qubit and one-qutrit systems. In particular, this geometric approach allows us to construct, for the first time, closed-form expressions for the maximal magic states in the three-qubit and one-qutrit systems, and to conjecture their total counts. In the three-qubit case, we further classify the extremal magic states according to their entanglement structure. We also examine the distinctive behaviour of one-qutrit maximal magic states with respect to Clifford orbits. Our findings suggest that deep algebraic and geometric symmetries underlie the structure of extremal magic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resource Complementarity in Finite-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resources such as entanglement, information redundancy, and coherence enable revolutionary advantages but obey fundamental tradeoffs. We present a unified geometric constraint governing three core operational tasks: teleportation ($q_1$), cloning ($q_2$), and coherence-based metrology ($q_3$). For any tripartite quantum state $\rho_{ABC}$, we show the tight inequality $q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 \leq 1$ confines all physically achievable resources to the positive octant of the unit ball. This Quantum Information Resource Constraint (QIRC) reflects an exclusion principle intrinsic to Hilbert space: optimizing one task necessitates sacrificing others. Crucially, $q_1, q_2, q_3$ are experimentally measurable, making QIRC falsifiable in quantum platforms. Unlike abstract quantum resource theories (QRT) that quantify resources through entropy or monotones, our framework is fundamentally operational, deriving tight constraints from measurable task fidelities in teleportation, cloning, and metrology. The emergent \(\ell^2\)-norm exclusion is irreducible to existing QRT axioms. Remarkably, we demonstrate the resource norm $\mathcal{I} = q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2$ is conserved under symmetry-preserving unitaries (quantum resource covariance principle) but contracts irreversibly under decoherence. This work establishes a fundamental link between quantum information geometry, symmetry, and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of chiral nematics in a channel and sudden contraction geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chirality, viscous effects, and confinement geometry on the flow dynamics and defect structures of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) using numerical simulations. As chiral strength increases, $\pi$-twist defects form at low chirality and progressively organize into hexagonal domains resembling blue phase--like (BP-like) structures at higher chirality. At sufficiently high chirality and aspect ratios, skyrmion-like configurations emerge, indicating the formation of dynamic analogs of equilibrium phases under flow. Sudden contraction geometries reveal how aspect ratio and elastic interactions promote flow disturbances and defect development. Analyses of velocity and scalar order parameter ($S$) distributions demonstrate strong coupling between molecular alignment and hydrodynamic fields, with localized vortices forming around $\tau^-$ defects in regions of low $S$ and velocity. Temporal evaluations of velocity fluctuations uncover chaotic flow regimes at low Ericksen numbers, characterized by irregular defect motion and skewed probability density functions. These findings offer new insights into CLC structure formation and flow behavior, with potential applications in defect engineering, microfluidics, soft robotics, and photonic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic rotational invariance of an integration by parts formula inspired by the Bismut approach to Malliavin calculus is proved in the framework of the Lie symmetry theory of stochastic differential equations. The non-trivial effect of the rotational invariance of the driving Brownian motion in the derivation of the integration by parts formula is discussed and the invariance property of the formula is shown via applications to some explicit two-dimensional Brownian motion-driven stochastic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study eigenvalue problems associated to self-adjoint operators and their approximation obtained by subspace projection, as used in the reduced basis method for instance. We provide error bounds between the exact eigenmodes and the approximated ones and also consider degenerate cases in the analysis. When the operator depends on a parameter, we apply the bounds assuming that the reduced space contains the derivatives of the eigenfunction with respect to the parameter. Finally, we provide some numerical examples that reflect the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of remarkable (1+2)-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential subalgebra of this algebra, which consists of linear generalized symmetries, is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration. We also establish an isomorphism between this algebra and the Lie algebra associated with the second Weyl algebra, which provides a dual perspective for studying their properties. After developing the theoretical background of finding exact solutions of homogeneous linear systems of differential equations using their linear generalized symmetries, we efficiently apply it to the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new solution to the classical black box problem (the discrete Calderon problem) in the theory of circular electrical networks. Our approach is based on the explicit embedding of electrical networks into non-negative Grassmannians and generalized chamber ansatz for it. Also, we reveal the relation of this problem with the combinatorial properties of spanning groves and the theory of totally non-negative matrices.

      <description>arXiv:2502.18349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have been made to understand the statistics of the Aztec diamond dimer model under general periodic weights. In this work we define a model that breaks periodicity in one direction by combining two different two-periodic weightings. We compute the correlation kernel for this Aztec diamond dimer model by extending the methods developed by Berggren and Duits (2019), which utilize the Eynard-Mehta theorem and a Wiener-Hopf factorization. From a form of the correlation kernel that is suitable for asymptotics, we compute the local asymptotics of the model in the different macroscopic regions present. We prove that the local asymptotics of the model agree with the typical two-periodic model in the highest order, however the sub-leading order terms are affected.</description>

      <title>Determinantal random subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two families of determinantal random spanning subgraphs of a finite connected graph, one supported by acyclic spanning subgraphs (spanning forests) with fixed number of connected components, the other by connected spanning subgraphs with fixed number of independent cycles. Each family generalizes the uniform spanning tree and the generating functions of these probability measures generalize the classical Kirchhoff and Symanzik polynomials.
  We call Symanzik spanning forests the elements of the acyclic spanning subgraphs family, and single out a particular determinantal mixture of these, having as kernel a normalized Laplacian on $1$-forms, which we call the Laplacian spanning forest.
  Our proofs rely on a set of integral and real or complex (which we call geometric) multilinear identies involving cycles, coboundaries, and forests on graphs. We prove these identities using classical pieces of the algebraic topology of graphs and the exterior calculus applied to finite determinantal point processes, both of which we treat in a self-contained way.
  We emphasize the matroidal nature of our constructions, thereby showing how the above two families of random spanning subgraphs are dual to one another, as well as possible generalisations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08571v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is threefold. First, we show that when one explores a conformal loop ensemble of parameter $\kappa=4$ ($\mathrm{CLE}_4$) on an independent $2$-Liouville quantum gravity ($2$-LQG) disk, the surfaces which are cut out are independent quantum disks. To achieve this, we rely on approximations of the explorations of a $\mathrm{CLE}_4$: we first approximate the $\mathrm{SLE}_4^{\langle \mu \rangle}(-2)$ explorations for $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ using explorations of the $\mathrm{CLE}_\kappa$ as $\kappa \uparrow 4$ and then we approximate the uniform exploration by letting $\mu \to \infty$. Second, we describe the relation between the so-called natural quantum distance and the conformally invariant distance to the boundary introduced by Werner and Wu. Third, we establish the scaling limit of the distances from the boundary to the large faces of $3/2$-stable maps and relate the limit to the $\mathrm{CLE}_4$-decorated $2$-LQG.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for ABS equations II: tetrahedron and octahedron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present four types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form associated to the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. These include the triangle Lagrangian that has traditionally been used in the Lagrangian multiform description of ABS equations, the trident Lagrangian that was central to Part I of this paper, and two Lagrangians that have not been studied in the multiform setting. Two of the Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations, and one produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the well-established Lagrangian 2-form for these equations, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations).
  We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing is a framework for implementing polynomial functions on quantum computers. To implement a given polynomial $P$, one must first construct a corresponding complementary polynomial $Q$. Existing approaches to this problem employ numerical methods that are not amenable to explicit error analysis. We present a new approach to complementary polynomials using complex analysis. Our main mathematical result is a contour integral representation for a canonical complementary polynomial. On the unit circle, this representation has a particularly simple and efficacious Fourier analytic interpretation, which we use to develop a Fast Fourier Transform-based algorithm for the efficient calculation of $Q$ in the monomial basis with explicit error guarantees. Numerical evidence that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization-based method for computing complementary polynomials is provided.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study eigenfunction localization for higher dimensional cat maps, a popular model of quantum chaos. These maps are given by linear symplectic maps in ${\mathrm{Sp}}(2g,\mathbb Z)$, which we take to be ergodic. Under some natural assumptions, we show that there is a density one sequence of integers $N$ so that as $N$ tends to infinity along this sequence, all eigenfunctions of the quantized map at the inverse Planck constant $N$ are uniformly distributed. For the two-dimensional case ($g=1$), this was proved by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). The higher dimensional case offers several new features and requires a completely different set of tools, including from additive combinatorics, in particular Bourgain's bound (2005) for Mordell sums, and a study of tensor product structures for the cat map.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic operators in $c=0$ bulk CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Kac operators (e.g. energy operator) in percolation and self-avoiding walk bulk CFTs with central charge $c=0$. The proper normalizations of these operators can be deduced at generic $c$ by requiring the finiteness and reality of the three-point constants in cluster and loop model CFTs. At $c=0$, Kac operators become zero-norm states and the bottom fields of logarithmic multiplets, and comparison with $c&lt;1$ Liouville CFT suggests the potential existence of arbitrarily high rank Jordan blocks. We give a generic construction of logarithmic operators based on Kac operators and focus on the rank-2 pair of the energy operator mixing with the hull operator. By taking the $c\to 0$ limit, we compute some of their conformal data and use this to investigate the operator algebra at $c=0$. Based on cluster decomposition, we find that, contrary to previous belief, the four-point correlation function of the bulk energy operator does not vanish at $c=0$, and a crucial role is played by its coupling to the rank-3 Jordan block associated with the second energy operator. This reveals the intriguing way zero-norm operators build long-range higher-point correlations through the intricate logarithmic structures in $c=0$ bulk CFTs.</description>

      <title>Causal Classification of Pathological Misner-Type Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Misner space, incorporating Kip Thorne's "moving wall" model, and pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, exploring their geometric structures, geodesics, and causal properties. We propose that pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime serves as a non-flat generalization of Misner space. We then introduce the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, a novel chronology-violating model that extends the previous two frameworks and unifies the geodesic structures of all three spacetimes. We suggest that these spacetimes constitute a causality-violating family, interconnected through common fundamental causal features$-$geodesics, Cauchy and chronology horizons, and acausal regions$-$leading a conjecture that they are isocausal.</description>

      <title>Mass (re)distribution for quantum dust cores of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collective ground state for a spherical symmetric dust ball has been investigated recently in [R. Casadio, Phys. Lett. B 843 (2023) 138055]. In this study, we refine that model by obtaining a mass distribution that accounts for the superposition of wavefunctions across different layers. The refined mass distribution shows significant deviations from the approximation without quantum superpositions. Specifically, the new nearly parabolic distribution replaces the linear mass profile of the original work, featuring an overall downward concavity, which leads to a non-vanishing tension. Notably, the regularity of the metric and causal structure are preserved in the refined analysis.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for ABS equations I: quad equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational perspective on lattice equations that are integrable in the sense of multidimensional consistency. The Lagrangian multiforms for the equations of the ABS classification formed the start of this theory, but the Lagrangian multiforms that are usually considered in this context produce equations that are slightly weaker than the ABS equations. In this work, we present alternative Lagrangian multiforms that have Euler-Lagrange equations equivalent to the ABS equations.
  In addition, the treatment of the ABS Lagrangian multiforms in the existing literature fails to acknowledge that the complex functions in their definitions have branch cuts. The choice of branch affects both the existence of an additive three-leg form for the ABS equations and the closure property of the Lagrangian multiforms. We give counterexamples for both these properties, but we recover them by including integer-valued fields, related to possible the branch choices, in the action sums.</description>

Abstract: Hirota's discrete KdV equation is a well-known integrable two-dimensional partial difference equation regarded as a discrete analogue of the KdV equation. In this paper, we show that a variation of Hirota's discrete KdV equation with an additional parameter admits two types of exact solutions: discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions and periodic solutions described by Painlev\'e-type ordinary difference equations.</description>

      <title>Itzykson-Zuber correlators from character expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the consistency of character expansion for the Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) model in terms of Schur polynomials with the old formulas for pair correlators with the IZ measure. An essential new feature of the correlators is that they are not symmetric in eigenvalues - and thus can not be expressed through Schur polynomials only. Instead, we demonstrate that an expression is possible in terms of Schur derivatives. This opens a new way to study arbitrary IZ correlators of any order in character expansion.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Expanded regimes of area law for lattice Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the parameter regimes for which area law is proven for pure $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories, in particular when $N$ is large. This improves on a classical result of Osterwalder-Seiler from 1978. To do so, we view the master loop equation as a linear inhomogeneous equation for Wilson string expectations, and then prove an a priori bound for solutions to the equation. The main novelty is in how we deal with the merger term in the master loop equation. This is done by introducing a truncated model for which the merger term is unproblematic, and then showing that the truncated model well approximates the original model.</description>

      <title>Super Macdonald polynomials and BPS state counting on the blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</description>
