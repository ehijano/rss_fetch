      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Reservoir Management via Murmuration Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional centralized water management systems face critical limitations from computational complexity and uncertainty propagation. We present MurmuRL, a novel decentralized framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence, integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with multi-agent reinforcement learning. MurmuRL enables individual reservoirs to make autonomous local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. Experiments on grid networks demonstrate that MurmuRL achieves 8.8% higher final performance while using 27% less computing overhead compared to centralized approaches. Notably, strategic diversity scales super-linearly with system size, exhibiting sophisticated coordination patterns and enhanced resilience during extreme events. MurmuRL offers a scalable solution for managing complex water systems by leveraging principles of natural collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Provably Safe Control for Constrained Nonlinear Systems with Bounded Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world control applications, actuator constraints and output constraints (specifically in tracking problems) are inherent and critical to ensuring safe and reliable operation. However, generally, control strategies often neglect these physical limitations, leading to potential instability, degraded performance, or even system failure when deployed on real-world systems. This paper addresses the control design problem for a class of nonlinear systems under both actuator saturation and output constraints. First, a smooth asymmetric saturation model (a more generic representative of practical scenarios) is proposed to model actuator saturation, which ensures that the control inputs always remain confined within a predefined set to ensure safety. Based on the proposed model, we develop a nonlinear control framework that guarantees output tracking while ensuring that system output remains confined to the predefined set. Later, we integrate this design with the constrained output tracking control problem, wherein we show that the system output tracks its desired trajectory by simultaneously satisfying input and output constraints. The global stabilization of the tracking error is achieved in the presence of input constraints, while semi-global stabilization is achieved in the presence of both input and output constraints. Additionally, we rigorously establish the boundedness of all closed-loop signals under the proposed design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling asymmetric constraints while achieving desirable tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Signal Modeling for Talkative Power Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talkative power conversion is a switching ripple communication technique that integrates data modulation into a switched-mode power electronics converter, enabling simultaneous information transmission and power conversion. Despite numerous research papers published over the last decade on various theoretical and practical aspects of this emerging topic, thorough signal modeling suitable for analysis and computer simulations is still lacking. In this article, we derive the continuous-time output voltage of a DC/DC switched-mode power electronics converter for a broad range of pulsed-based modulation schemes. We also develop corresponding discrete-time signal models and assess their accuracies. Finally, we devise a generic end-to-end signal model for arbitrary modulation signals, discuss implications of continuous-time and discrete-time signal modeling on equalization, and consider generalizations to include parasitic effects as well as the influence of general impedance loads.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Mission Planning For Space Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As space missions become more complex, planning methods must maximize mission performance while rigorously enforcing safety. We develop a probabilistic approach based on a finite-horizon Markov decision process to optimize spacecraft operations planning with safety guarantees. In the model, states capture essential mission parameters, and actions represent the operational adjustments needed to meet mission objectives. By directly incorporating uncertainties from environmental conditions and spacecraft dynamics, an optimal sequence of actions is computed that maximizes expected rewards and strictly enforces safety constraints. Numerical experiments on the GRACE-FO mission demonstrate robust performance under uncertainties while providing probabilistic safety guarantees, offering a reliable solution for autonomous spacecraft operations.</description>

      <title>Data driven approach towards more efficient Newton-Raphson power flow calculation for distribution grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are fundamental to power system analysis to ensure stable and reliable grid operation. The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is commonly used for PF analysis due to its rapid convergence when initialized properly. However, as power grids operate closer to their capacity limits, ill-conditioned cases and convergence issues pose significant challenges. This work, therefore, addresses these challenges by proposing strategies to improve NR initialization, hence minimizing iterations and avoiding divergence. We explore three approaches: (i) an analytical method that estimates the basin of attraction using mathematical bounds on voltages, (ii) Two data-driven models leveraging supervised learning or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict optimal initial guesses, and (iii) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that incrementally adjusts voltages to accelerate convergence. These methods are tested on benchmark systems. This research is particularly relevant for modern power systems, where high penetration of renewables and decentralized generation require robust and scalable PF solutions. In experiments, all three proposed methods demonstrate a strong ability to provide an initial guess for Newton-Raphson method to converge with fewer steps. The findings provide a pathway for more efficient real-time grid operations, which, in turn, support the transition toward smarter and more resilient electricity networks.</description>

      <title>Reachability Analysis of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Polyhedral Relaxations and Constrained Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for reachability analysis of nonlinear discrete-time systems. The proposed method combines constrained zonotopes (CZs) with polyhedral relaxations of factorable representations of nonlinear functions to propagate CZs through nonlinear functions, which is normally done using conservative linearization techniques. The new propagation method provides better approximations than those resulting from linearization procedures, leading to significant improvements in the computation of reachable sets in comparison to other CZ methods from the literature. Numerical examples highlight the advantages of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal SVI-Weighted PSPS Decisions with Decision-Dependent Outage Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are a pre-emptive strategy to mitigate the wildfires caused by power system malfunction. System operators implement PSPS to balance wildfire mitigation efforts through de-energization of transmission lines against the risk of widespread blackouts modeled with load shedding.
  Existing approaches do not incorporate decision-dependent wildfire-driven failure probabilities, as modeling outage scenario probabilities requires incorporating high-order polynomial terms in the objective. This paper uses distribution shaping to develop an efficient MILP problem representation of the distributionally robust PSPS problem. Building upon the author's prior work, the wildfire risk of operating a transmission line is a function of the probability of a wildfire-driven outage and its subsequent expected impact in acres burned.
  A day-ahead unit commitment and line de-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the trade-off between total cost and wildfire risk at different levels of distributional robustness, parameterized by a level of distributional dissimilarity $\kappa$. We perform simulations on the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Power Swing Characteristics of Grid-Forming VSC System Considering the Current Limitation Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates power swing characteristics of grid-forming voltage source converter (GFM-VSC) systems considering the current limitation mode in both non-inertial and inertial GFM-VSC systems. Following grid faults, non-inertial GFM-VSC systems can re-synchronize with the grid but may experience significant power swings driven by its control dynamics, while inertial GFM-VSC systems may exhibit loss of synchronization (LOS), characterized by the divergence of the output angle in the active power control loop. These behaviours are different from conventional synchronous generator (SG)-based systems, where power swings are typically characterized by physical angle deviations among power sources. Based on these findings, this paper explores the performance of traditional impedance-based swing detection schemes in GFM-VSC systems. The theoretical analysis is validated through various simulations using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform, covering both single and multi-machine system scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Koopman Operator Approach to Data-Driven Control of Semilinear Parabolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the data-driven stabilization of unknown boundary controlled semilinear parabolic systems. The nonlinear dynamics of the system are lifted using a finite number of eigenfunctionals of the Koopman operator related to the autonomous semilinear PDE. This results in a novel data-driven finite-dimensional model of the lifted dynamics, which is amenable to apply design procedures for finite-dimensional systems to stabilize the semilinear parabolic system. In order to facilitate this, a bilinearization of the lifted dynamics is considered and feedback linearization is applied for the data-driven stabilization of the semilinear parabolic PDE. This reveals a novel connection between the assignment of eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop Koopman operator and feedback linearization. By making use of a modal representation, exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of errors resulting from the data-driven computation of eigenfunctionals and the bilinearization is verified. The data-driven controller directly follows from applying generalized eDMD to state data available for the semilinear parabolic PDE. An example of an unstable semilinear reaction-diffusion system with finite-time blow up demonstrates the novel data-driven stabilization approach.</description>

      <title>Power Line Communication vs. Talkative Power Conversion: A Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of energy transmission and data communication has become a key feature of decentralized energy systems across a broad spectrum of voltage/power ranges, including smart grid applications and cyber-physical power systems. This paper compares two distinct approaches: Power Line Communications (PLC) and Talkative Power Conversion (TPC). While PLC leverages existing power infrastructure for data transmission by using external data transmitters and receivers, TPC integrates communication capabilities directly into power electronic converters. We present their technical foundations and applications, benchmark their strengths and bottlenecks, and outline future research directions regarding TPC that could bridge the gap between power and communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Contract-based hierarchical control using predictive feasibility value functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's control systems are often characterized by modularity and safety requirements to handle complexity, resulting in hierarchical control structures. Although hierarchical model predictive control offers favorable properties, achieving a provably safe, yet modular design remains a challenge. This paper introduces a contract-based hierarchical control strategy to improve the performance of control systems facing challenges related to model inconsistency and independent controller design across hierarchies. We consider a setup where a higher-level controller generates references that affect the constraints of a lower-level controller, which is based on a soft-constrained MPC formulation. The optimal slack variables serve as the basis for a contract that allows the higher-level controller to assess the feasibility of the reference trajectory without exact knowledge of the model, constraints, and cost of the lower-level controller. To ensure computational efficiency while maintaining model confidentiality, we propose using an explicit function approximation, such as a neural network, to represent the cost of optimal slack values. The approach is tested for a hierarchical control setup consisting of a planner and a motion controller as commonly found in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>The CAM Model: An in vivo Testbed for Molecular Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) research increasingly focuses on biomedical applications like health monitoring and drug delivery, demanding testing in realistic living environments. Elevating MC research requires developing advanced in vivo testbeds. We introduce the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model as the first versatile 3D in vivo MC platform. The CAM, a highly vascularized membrane in fertilized chicken eggs, is established in bioengineering, cancer research, and drug development. Its biological realism, reproducibility, and versatility make it ideal for next-generation MC testbeds, bridging proof-of-concept systems and practical applications. We comprehensively characterize the CAM model's properties and MC system relevance. Through experimental studies, we investigate fluorescent molecule distribution in the CAM's closed-loop vascular system. We derive an analytical model using the wrapped normal distribution to describe particle propagation in dispersive closed-loop systems dominated by diffusion and flow. Parametric models are developed to approximate particle dynamics in the CAM, with parameters estimated via nonlinear least squares curve fitting. A dataset of 69 regions from 25 eggs validates our models. We analyze parameter relationships and biological plausibility. Finally, we develop a parametric model for long-term particle behavior and liver accumulation in chick embryos.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes the discrete-time modeling approach for interturn short circuits in interior permanent magnet synchronous motors with concentrated windings that facilitate model-based fault diagnostics and mitigation. A continuous-time model incorporating universal series-parallel stator winding connection and radial permanent magnet fluxes is developed in the stator variables and transformed into the rotor reference frame, including also the electromagnetic torque. The transformed model undergoes discretization using the matrix exponential-based technique, wherein the electrical angular velocity and angle are considered time-varying parameters. The resulting model is subsequently expanded to consider the motor connection resistance via perturbation techniques. In the laboratory experiments, we validate the dynamical properties of the derived model by comparing its outputs with the experimental data and waveforms generated by the forward Euler-based discrete-time approximation.</description>

      <title>Servo-Controllers with Operational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a proportional-integral servo-control design method is developed for multi-input-multioutput linear time invariant systems with operational constraints imposed on the system control input and on an output of the same dimension as the control input. The design is based on min-norm controllers and Control Barrier Functions. It allows to enforce min/max box constraints by analytically solving Quadratic Programs for min-norm augmentation controllers. The method provides an anti-windup protection for the controller integrator state and enforces the desired operational control and output constraints, component-wise. A simulation example is given to illustrate potential benefits of the proposed design methodology for aerial flight critical systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for constructing the Region of Attraction (RoA) for dynamics derived either from Piecewise Affine (PWA) functions or from Neural Networks (NNs) with Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) activation function. This method, described as Sequential Estimation of RoA based on Invariant Set Estimation (SEROAISE), computes a Lyapunov-like PWA function over a certified PWA invariant set. While traditional approaches search for Lyapunov functions by enforcing Lyapunov conditions over pre-selected domains, this framework enforces Lyapunov-like conditions over a certified invariant subset obtained using the Iterative Invariant Set Estimator(IISE). Compared to the state-of-the-art, IISE provides systematically larger certified invariant sets. In order to find a larger invariant subset, the IISE utilizes a novel concept known as the Non-Uniform Growth of Invariant Set (NUGIS). A number of examples illustrating the efficacy of the proposed methods are provided, including dynamical systems derived from learning algorithms. The implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/PouyaSamanipour/SEROAISE.git.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Task Parameterization of Tool-Tissue Interaction via Sparse Landmarks Tracking in Robotic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of tool-tissue interactions in robotic surgery requires precise tracking of deformable tissues and integration of surgical domain knowledge. Traditional methods rely on labor-intensive annotations or rigid assumptions, limiting flexibility. We propose a framework combining sparse keypoint tracking and probabilistic modeling that propagates expert-annotated landmarks across endoscopic frames, even with large tissue deformations. Clustered tissue keypoints enable dynamic local transformation construction via PCA, and tool poses, tracked similarly, are expressed relative to these frames. Embedding these into a Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) integrates data-driven observations with labeled clinical expertise, effectively predicting relative tool-tissue poses and enhancing visual understanding of robotic surgical motions directly from video data.</description>

      <title>Sub-optimality of the Separation Principle for Quadratic Control from Bilinear Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system from bilinear observations with minimal quadratic cost. Despite the similarity of this problem to standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, we show that when the observation model is bilinear, neither does the Separation Principle hold, nor is the optimal controller affine in the estimated state. Moreover, the cost-to-go is non-convex in the control input. Hence, finding an analytical expression for the optimal feedback controller is difficult in general. Under certain settings, we show that the standard LQG controller locally maximizes the cost instead of minimizing it. Furthermore, the optimal controllers (derived analytically) are not unique and are nonlinear in the estimated state. We also introduce a notion of input-dependent observability and derive conditions under which the Kalman filter covariance remains bounded. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments in multiple synthetic settings.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Recovery with RIS: Designing Wireless Resilience in Mission-Critical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 6G and beyond redefine connectivity, wireless networks become the foundation of critical operations, making resilience more essential than ever. With this shift, wireless systems cannot only take on vital services previously handled by wired infrastructures but also enable novel innovative applications that would not be possible with wired systems. As a result, there is a pressing demand for strategies that can adapt to dynamic channel conditions, interference, and unforeseen disruptions, ensuring seamless and reliable performance in an increasingly complex environment. Despite considerable research, existing resilience assessments lack comprehensive key performance indicators (KPIs), especially those quantifying its adaptability, which are vital for identifying a system's capacity to rapidly adapt and reallocate resources. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the adaption performance by augmenting the gradient of the system's rate function. To further enhance the network resilience, we integrate Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) into our framework due to their capability to dynamically reshape the propagation environment while providing alternative channel paths. Numerical results show that gradient augmentation enhances resilience by improving adaptability under adverse conditions while proactively preparing for future disruptions.</description>

      <title>Achieving Tighter Finite-Time Rates for Heterogeneous Federated Stochastic Approximation under Markovian Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization with time-correlated data, we study a generic federated stochastic approximation problem involving $M$ agents, where each agent is characterized by an agent-specific (potentially nonlinear) local operator. The goal is for the agents to communicate intermittently via a server to find the root of the average of the agents' local operators. The generality of our setting stems from allowing for (i) Markovian data at each agent and (ii) heterogeneity in the roots of the agents' local operators. The limited recent work that has accounted for both these features in a federated setting fails to guarantee convergence to the desired point or to show any benefit of collaboration; furthermore, they rely on projection steps in their algorithms to guarantee bounded iterates. Our work overcomes each of these limitations. We develop a novel algorithm titled \texttt{FedHSA}, and prove that it guarantees convergence to the correct point, while enjoying an $M$-fold linear speedup in sample-complexity due to collaboration. To our knowledge, \emph{this is the first finite-time result of its kind}, and establishing it (without relying on a projection step) entails a fairly intricate argument that accounts for the interplay between complex temporal correlations due to Markovian sampling, multiple local steps to save communication, and the drift-effects induced by heterogeneous local operators. Our results have implications for a broad class of heterogeneous federated RL problems (e.g., policy evaluation and control) with function approximation, where the agents' Markov decision processes can differ in their probability transition kernels and reward functions.</description>

      <title>Linearity, Time Invariance, and Passivity of a Novice Person in Human Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-cost teleguidance of medical procedures is becoming essential to provide healthcare to remote and underserved communities. Human teleoperation is a promising new method for guiding a novice person with relatively high precision and efficiency through a mixed reality (MR) interface. Prior work has shown that the novice, or "follower", can reliably track the MR input with performance not unlike a telerobotic system. As a consequence, it is of interest to understand and control the follower's dynamics to optimize the system performance and permit stable and transparent bilateral teleoperation. To this end, linearity, time-invariance, inter-axis coupling, and passivity are important in teleoperation and controller design. This paper therefore explores these effects with regard to the follower person in human teleoperation. It is demonstrated through modeling and experiments that the follower can indeed be treated as approximately linear and time invariant, with little coupling and a large excess of passivity at practical frequencies. Furthermore, a stochastic model of the follower dynamics is derived. These results will permit controller design and analysis to improve the performance of human teleoperation.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm of User-Centric Wireless Communication Driven by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of wireless communications seeks to deeply integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with user-centric communication networks, with the goal of developing AI-native networks that more accurately address user requirements. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential in realizing these goals. However, existing efforts that leverage LLMs for wireless communication often overlook the considerable gap between human natural language and the intricacies of real-world communication systems, thus failing to fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-driven paradigm for wireless communication that innovatively incorporates the nature language to structured query language (NL2SQL) tool. Specifically, in this paradigm, user personal requirements is the primary focus. Upon receiving a user request, LLMs first analyze the user intent in terms of relevant communication metrics and system parameters. Subsequently, a structured query language (SQL) statement is generated to retrieve the specific parameter values from a high-performance real-time database. We further utilize LLMs to formulate and solve an optimization problem based on the user request and the retrieved parameters. The solution to this optimization problem then drives adjustments in the communication system to fulfill the user's requirements. To validate the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, we present a prototype system. In this prototype, we consider user-request centric semantic communication (URC-SC) system in which a dynamic semantic representation network at the physical layer adapts its encoding depth to meet user requirements. Additionally, two LLMs are employed to analyze user requests and generate SQL statements, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11717v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel state-action control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.</description>

      <title>Manifold meta-learning for reduced-complexity neural system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System identification has greatly benefited from deep learning techniques, particularly for modeling complex, nonlinear dynamical systems with partially unknown physics where traditional approaches may not be feasible. However, deep learning models often require large datasets and significant computational resources at training and inference due to their high-dimensional parameterizations. To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that discovers a low-dimensional manifold within the parameter space of an over-parameterized neural network architecture. This manifold is learned from a meta-dataset of input-output sequences generated by a class of related dynamical systems, enabling efficient model training while preserving the network's expressive power for the considered system class. Unlike bilevel meta-learning approaches, our method employs an auxiliary neural network to map datasets directly onto the learned manifold, eliminating the need for costly second-order gradient computations during meta-training and reducing the number of first-order updates required in inference, which could be expensive for large models. We validate our approach on a family of Bouc-Wen oscillators, which is a well-studied nonlinear system identification benchmark. We demonstrate that we are able to learn accurate models even in small-data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Transferable Deployment of Semantic Edge Inference Systems via Unsupervised Domain Adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates deploying semantic edge inference systems for performing a common image clarification task. In particular, each system consists of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices that first locally encode the sensing data into semantic features and then transmit them to an edge server for subsequent data fusion and task inference. The inference accuracy is determined by efficient training of the feature encoder/decoder using labeled data samples. Due to the difference in sensing data and communication channel distributions, deploying the system in a new environment may induce high costs in annotating data labels and re-training the encoder/decoder models. To achieve cost-effective transferable system deployment, we propose an efficient Domain Adaptation method for Semantic Edge INference systems (DASEIN) that can maintain high inference accuracy in a new environment without the need for labeled samples. Specifically, DASEIN exploits the task-relevant data correlation between different deployment scenarios by leveraging the techniques of unsupervised domain adaptation and knowledge distillation. It devises an efficient two-step adaptation procedure that sequentially aligns the data distributions and adapts to the channel variations. Numerical results show that, under a substantial change in sensing data distributions, the proposed DASEIN outperforms the best-performing benchmark method by 7.09% and 21.33% in inference accuracy when the new environment has similar or 25 dB lower channel signal to noise power ratios (SNRs), respectively. This verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting both data and channel distributions in practical transfer deployment applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Secure RSMA Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel data-dependent interleaving technique designed to enhance the security of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) networks by protecting the common stream from eavesdropping threats. Specifically, we exploit the RSMA structure by interleaving the common bits of each user based on a sequence derived from their private bits. By decoding its private stream, the legitimate receiver reconstructs the interleaving sequence set by the transmitter and successfully de-interleaves the common stream. Therefore, the common part is successfully prevented from being intercepted by an eavesdropper who is unable to deduce the dynamic changing interleaving permutations. To ensure dynamic interleaving sequences, a private bit selection approach that balances the trade-off between security and system efficiency is proposed. Simulation findings confirm the effectiveness of the suggested method, showing notable security improvements while maintaining robust overall system reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) has firmly established itself as a powerful methodology for multiple access, interference management, and multi-user strategy for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel channel-dependent splitter design for multi-carrier RSMA systems, aimed at improving reliability performance. Specifically, the proposed splitter leverages channel state information and the inherent structure of RSMA to intelligently replicate segments of the private stream data that are likely to encounter deep-faded subchannels into the common stream. Thus, the reliability is enhanced within the same transmission slot, minimizing the need for frequent retransmissions and thereby reducing latency. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using key performance metrics, including achievable sum rate, average packet delay, and bit error rate (BER), under both perfect and imperfect channel estimation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general system identification procedure capable of estimating of a broad spectrum of state-space dynamical models, including linear time-invariant (LTI), linear parameter-varying} (LPV), and nonlinear (NL) dynamics, along with rather general classes of noise models. Similar to the LTI case, we show that for this general class of model structures, including the NL case, the model dynamics can be separated into a deterministic process and a stochastic noise part, allowing to seamlessly tune the complexity of the combined model both in terms of nonlinearity and noise modeling. We parameterize the involved nonlinear functional relations by means of artificial neural-networks (ANNs), although alternative parametric nonlinear mappings can also be used. To estimate the resulting model structures, we optimize a prediction-error-based criterion using an efficient combination of a constrained quasi-Newton approach and automatic differentiation, achieving training times in the order of seconds compared to existing state-of-the-art ANN methods which may require hours for models of similar complexity. We formally establish the consistency guarantees for the proposed approach and demonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency on several benchmark LTI, LPV, and NL system identification problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that controllers designed by artificial potential fields (APFs) can be derived from reciprocal control barrier function quadratic program (RCBF-QP) safety filters. By integrating APFs within the RCBF-QP framework, we explicitly establish the relationship between these two approaches. Specifically, we first introduce the concepts of tightened control Lyapunov functions (T-CLFs) and tightened reciprocal control barrier functions (T-RCBFs), each of which incorporates a flexible auxiliary function. We then utilize an attractive potential field as a T-CLF to guide the nominal controller design, and a repulsive potential field as a T-RCBF to formulate an RCBF-QP safety filter. With appropriately chosen auxiliary functions, we show that controllers designed by APFs and those derived by RCBF-QP safety filters are equivalent. Based on this insight, we further generalize the APF-based controllers (equivalently, RCBF-QP safety filter-based controllers) to more general scenarios without restricting the choice of auxiliary functions. Finally, we present a collision avoidance example to clearly illustrate the connection and equivalence between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Survey of Load-Altering Attacks Against Power Grids: Attack Impact, Detection and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing penetration of IoT devices in power grids despite its benefits, raises cybersecurity concerns. In particular, load-altering attacks (LAAs) targeting high-wattage IoT-controllable load devices pose serious risks to grid stability and disrupt electricity markets. This paper provides a comprehensive review of LAAs, highlighting the threat model, analyzing their impact on transmission and distribution networks, and the electricity market dynamics. We also review the detection and localization schemes for LAAs that employ either model-based or data-driven approaches, with some hybrid methods combining the strengths of both. Additionally, mitigation techniques are examined, focusing on both preventive measures, designed to thwart attack execution, and reactive methods, which aim to optimize responses to ongoing attacks. We look into the application of each study and highlight potential streams for future research.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for Voltage Regulation and Current Sharing in DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design the controllers, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions that we then enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based local controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a unified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication topology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated using existing convex optimization tools. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance with a recent droop control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization with Gradient Tracking over Heterogeneous Delay-Prone Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed optimization problem over unidirectional networks with possibly time-invariant heterogeneous bounded transmission delays. In particular, we propose a modified version of the Accelerated Distributed Directed OPTimization (ADD-OPT) algorithm, herein called Robustified ADD-OPT (R-ADD-OPT), which is able to solve the distributed optimization problem, even when the communication links suffer from heterogeneous but bounded transmission delays. We show that if the gradient step-size of the R-ADD-OPT algorithm is within a certain range, which also depends on the maximum time delay in the network, then the nodes are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem. The range of the gradient step-size that guarantees convergence can be computed a priori based on the maximum time delay in the network.</description>

      <title>Robust MPC for Uncertain Linear Systems -- Combining Model Adaptation and Iterative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach iteratively refines the parameter estimates using set membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to an existing robust adaptive MPC approach.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Robotic Skill Acquisition From a Suboptimal Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.

      <title>Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</description>

      <title>Inferring Short-Sightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, specifying how far into the future each agent plans. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in foresightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's foresightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an \emph{inverse} dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters to solve for agents' foresightedness. We conduct two types of experiments: one with synthetically generated pedestrian motion at a crosswalk and the other with real-world intersection data involving people walking, biking, and driving vehicles. The results of these experiments demonstrate that explicitly inferring agents' foresightedness enables game-theoretic models to more accurately model agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show 33% more accurate prediction of foresighted behavior on average compared to the baseline in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>ADAPT: An Autonomous Forklift for Construction Site Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient material logistics play a critical role in controlling costs and schedules in the construction industry. However, manual material handling remains prone to inefficiencies, delays, and safety risks. Autonomous forklifts offer a promising solution to streamline on-site logistics, reducing reliance on human operators and mitigating labor shortages. This paper presents the development and evaluation of ADAPT (Autonomous Dynamic All-terrain Pallet Transporter), a fully autonomous off-road forklift designed for construction environments. Unlike structured warehouse settings, construction sites pose significant challenges, including dynamic obstacles, unstructured terrain, and varying weather conditions. To address these challenges, our system integrates AI-driven perception techniques with traditional approaches for decision making, planning, and control, enabling reliable operation in complex environments. We validate the system through extensive real-world testing, comparing its continuous performance against an experienced human operator across various weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous outdoor forklifts can operate near human-level performance, offering a viable path toward safer and more efficient construction logistics.</description>

      <title>$\pi$-MPPI: A Projection-based Model Predictive Path Integral Scheme for Smooth Optimal Control of Fixed-Wing Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) is a popular sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for nonlinear systems. It optimizes trajectories by sampling control sequences and averaging them. However, a key issue with MPPI is the non-smoothness of the optimal control sequence, leading to oscillations in systems like fixed-wing aerial vehicles (FWVs). Existing solutions use post-hoc smoothing, which fails to bound control derivatives. This paper introduces a new approach: we add a projection filter $\pi$ to minimally correct control samples, ensuring bounds on control magnitude and higher-order derivatives. The filtered samples are then averaged using MPPI, leading to our $\pi$-MPPI approach. We minimize computational overhead by using a neural accelerated custom optimizer for the projection filter. $\pi$-MPPI offers a simple way to achieve arbitrary smoothness in control sequences. While we focus on FWVs, this projection filter can be integrated into any MPPI pipeline. Applied to FWVs, $\pi$-MPPI is easier to tune than the baseline, resulting in smoother, more robust performance.</description>
