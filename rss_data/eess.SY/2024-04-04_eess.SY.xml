      <title>Observability of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the observability of nonlinear Dynamical Systems over Finite Fields (DSFF) through the Koopman operator framework. In this work, given a nonlinear DSFF, we construct a linear system of the smallest dimension, called the Linear Output Realization (LOR), which can generate all the output sequences of the original nonlinear system through proper choices of initial conditions (of the associated LOR). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the observability of a nonlinear system and establish that the maximum number of outputs sufficient for computing the initial condition is precisely equal to the dimension of the LOR. Further, when the system is not known to be observable, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique reconstruction of initial conditions for specific output sequences.</description>

      <title>Detection and Mitigation of Cyberattacks on Volt-Var Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, and attackers can use different mechanisms, such as denial of service (DoS) and false data injection (FDI). Furthermore, multiple attack types can be launched simultaneously, known as hybrid attacks, to cause more damage. Volt-Var control algorithms are widely used in the distribution system to maintain the voltage within a nominal range. This work uses an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method to detect and mitigate hybrid cyberattacks on the Volt-VAr control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Decision Transformer as a Foundation Model for Partially Observable Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed-loop control of nonlinear dynamical systems with partial-state observability demands expert knowledge of a diverse, less standardized set of theoretical tools. Moreover, it requires a delicate integration of controller and estimator designs to achieve the desired system behavior. To establish a general controller synthesis framework, we explore the Decision Transformer (DT) architecture. Specifically, we first frame the control task as predicting the current optimal action based on past observations, actions, and rewards, eliminating the need for a separate estimator design. Then, we leverage the pre-trained language models, i.e., the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, to initialize DT and subsequently train it for control tasks using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Our comprehensive experiments across five distinct control tasks, ranging from maneuvering aerospace systems to controlling partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrate DT's capability to capture the parameter-agnostic structures intrinsic to control tasks. DT exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization abilities for completely new tasks and rapidly surpasses expert performance levels with a minimal amount of demonstration data. These findings highlight the potential of DT as a foundational controller for general control applications.</description>

      <title>Network-Aware and Welfare-Maximizing Dynamic Pricing for Energy Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of behind-the-meter (BTM) distributed energy resources (DER) within the electrical distribution network presents significant supply and demand flexibilities, but also introduces operational challenges such as voltage spikes and reverse power flows. In response, this paper proposes a network-aware dynamic pricing framework tailored for energy-sharing coalitions that aggregate small, but ubiquitous, BTM DER downstream of a distribution system operator's (DSO) revenue meter that adopts a generic net energy metering (NEM) tariff. By formulating a Stackelberg game between the energy-sharing market leader and its prosumers, we show that the dynamic pricing policy induces the prosumers toward a network-safe operation and decentrally maximizes the energy-sharing social welfare. The dynamic pricing mechanism involves a combination of a locational {\em ex-ante} dynamic price and an {\em ex-post} allocation, both of which are functions of the energy sharing's BTM DER. The {\em ex-post} allocation is proportionate to the price differential between the DSO NEM price and the energy sharing locational price. Simulation results using real DER data and the IEEE 13-bus test systems illustrate the dynamic nature of network-aware pricing at each bus, and its impact on voltage.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization on Uplink OFDMA and MU-MIMO for IEEE 802.11ax: Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter tackles a joint user scheduling, frequency resource allocation (USRA), multi-input-multi-output mode selection (MIMO MS) between single-user MIMO and multi-user (MU) MIMO, and MU-MIMO user selection problem, integrating uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in IEEE 802.11ax. Specifically, we focus on \textit{unsaturated traffic conditions} where users' data demands fluctuate. In unsaturated traffic conditions, considering packet volumes per user introduces a combinatorial problem, requiring the simultaneous optimization of MU-MIMO user selection and RA along the time-frequency-space axis. Consequently, dealing with the combinatorial nature of this problem, characterized by a large cardinality of unknown variables, poses a challenge that conventional optimization methods find nearly impossible to address. In response, this letter proposes an approach with deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) to solve the joint problem. Rather than simply adopting off-the-shelf DHRL, we \textit{tailor} the DHRL to the joint USRA and MS problem, thereby significantly improving the convergence speed and throughput. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly improved throughput compared to the existing schemes under various unsaturated traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Power System Transient Stability Assessment Method with Expert Guiding Neural-Regression-Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning based transient stability assessment (TSA) has achieved great success, yet the lack of interpretability hinders its industrial application. Although a great number of studies have tried to explore the interpretability of network solutions, many problems still remain unsolved: (1) the difference between the widely accepted power system knowledge and the generated interpretive rules is large, (2) the probability characteristics of the neural network have not been fully considered during generating the interpretive rules, (3) the cost of the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability is too heavy to take. To address these issues, an interpretable power system Transient Stability Assessment method with Expert guiding Neural-Regression-Tree (TSA-ENRT) is proposed. TSA-ENRT utilizes an expert guiding nonlinear regression tree to approximate the neural network prediction and the neural network can be explained by the interpretive rules generated by the tree model. The nonlinearity of the expert guiding nonlinear regression tree is endowed with the extracted knowledge from a simple two-machine three-bus power system, which forms an expert knowledge base and thus the generated interpretive rules are more consistent with human cognition. Besides, the expert guiding tree model can build a bridge between the interpretive rules and the probability prediction of neural network in a regression way. By regularizing the neural network with the average decision length of ENRT, the association of the neural network and tree model is constructed in the model training level which provides a better trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Extensive experiments indicate the interpretive rules generated by the proposed TSA-ENRT are highly consistent with the neural network prediction and more agreed with human expert cognition.</description>

      <title>On Future Power Systems Digital Twins: Towards a Standard Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy sector's digital transformation brings mutually dependent communication and energy infrastructure, tightening the relationship between the physical and the digital world. Digital twins (DT) are the key concept for this. This paper initially discusses the evolution of the DT concept across various engineering applications before narrowing its focus to the power systems domain. By reviewing different definitions and applications, we present a new definition of DTs specifically tailored to power systems. Based on the proposed definition and extensive deliberations and consultations with distribution system operators, energy traders, and municipalities, we introduce a standard DT ecosystem architecture that offers services beyond real-time updates and can seamlessly integrate with existing transmission and distribution system operators' processes, while reconciling with concepts such as microgrids and local energy communities based on a system-of-systems view. We also discuss the integration of power system DTs into various phases of the system's life cycle, such as long-term planning, emphasizing challenges that remain to be addressed, such as managing measurement and model errors, and uncertainty propagation. Finally, we present our vision of how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can enhance several power system DT modules established in the proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Learning with errors based dynamic encryption that discloses residue signal for anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a protocol that detects integrity attacks on control systems by comparing the residue signal with a threshold. Implementing anomaly detection on encrypted control systems has been a challenge because it is hard to detect an anomaly from the encrypted residue signal without the secret key. In this paper, we propose a dynamic encryption scheme for a linear system that automatically discloses the residue signal. The initial state and the input are encrypted based on the zero-dynamics of the system, so that the effect of encryption on the residue signal remains identically zero. The proposed scheme is shown to be secure in the sense that no other information than the residue signal is disclosed. Furthermore, we demonstrate a method of utilizing the disclosed residue signal to operate an observer-based controller over encrypted data for an infinite time horizon without re-encryption.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing switched nonlinear systems under restricted but arbitrary switching signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with input/output-to-state stability (IOSS) of switched nonlinear systems whose switching signals obey pre-specified restrictions on admissible switches between the subsystems and admissible dwell times on the subsystems. We present sufficient conditions on the subsystems, admissible switches between them and admissible dwell times on them, such that a switched system generated under all switching signals obeying the given restrictions is IOSS. Multiple Lyapunov-like functions and graph theory are the key apparatuses for our analysis. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate our results.</description>

      <title>Towards a unifying framework for data-driven predictive control with quadratic regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven predictive control (DPC) has recently gained popularity as an alternative to model predictive control (MPC). Amidst the surge in proposed DPC frameworks, upon closer inspection, many of these frameworks are more closely related (or perhaps even equivalent) to each other than it may first appear. We argue for a more formal characterization of these relationships so that results can be freely transferred from one framework to another, rather than being uniquely attributed to a particular framework. We demonstrate this idea by examining the connection between $\gamma$-DDPC and the original DeePC formulation.</description>

      <title>Extending direct data-driven predictive control towards systems with finite control sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although classical model predictive control with finite control sets (FCS-MPC) is quite a popular control method, particularly in the realm of power electronics systems, its direct data-driven predictive control (FCS-DPC) counterpart has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce a novel reformulation of a commonly used DPC scheme that allows for the application of a modified sphere decoding algorithm, known for its efficiency and prominence in FCS-MPC applications. We test the reformulation on a popular electrical drive example and compare the computation times of sphere decoding FCS-DPC with an enumeration-based and a MIQP method.</description>

      <title>Impact and Integration of Mini Photovoltaic Systems on Electric Power Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the impact of varying concentrations mini-photovoltaic (MPV) systems, often referred to as balcony power plants, on the stability and control of the low-voltage (LV) grid. By local energy use and potentially reversing meter operation, we focus on how these MPV systems transform grid dynamics and elucidate consumer participation in the energy transition. We scrutinize the effects of these systems on power quality, power loss, transformer loading, and the functioning of other inverter-based voltage-regulating distributed energy resources (DER). Owing to the rise in renewable output from MPVs, the emerging bidirectional energy flow poses challenges for distribution grids abundant with DERs. Our case studies, featuring sensitivity analysis and comparison of distributed and decentralized DER control strategies, highlight that autonomous inverters are essential for providing ancillary services. With the growing use of battery energy storage (BES) systems in LV grids for these services, the need for adaptable DER control strategies becomes increasingly evident.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the automotive security sector, the absence of a testing platform that is configurable, practical, and user-friendly presents considerable challenges. These difficulties are compounded by the intricate design of vehicle systems, the rapid evolution of attack vectors, and the absence of standardized testing methodologies. We propose a next-generation testing platform that addresses several challenges in vehicle cybersecurity testing and research domains. In this paper, we detail how the Vehicle Security Engineering Cloud (VSEC) Test platform enables easier access to test beds for efficient vehicle cybersecurity testing and advanced (e.g., penetration, fuzz) testing and how we extend such test beds to benefit automotive security research. We highlight methodology on how to use this platform for a variety of users and use cases with real implemented examples.</description>

      <title>Robust Constrained Consensus and Inequality-constrained Distributed Optimization with Guaranteed Differential Privacy and Accurate Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address differential privacy for fully distributed optimization subject to a shared inequality constraint. By co-designing the distributed optimization mechanism and the differential-privacy noise injection mechanism, we propose the first distributed constrained optimization algorithm that can ensure both provable convergence to a global optimal solution and rigorous $\epsilon$-differential privacy, even when the number of iterations tends to infinity. Our approach does not require the Lagrangian function to be strictly convex/concave, and allows the global objective function to be non-separable. As a byproduct of the co-design, we also propose a new constrained consensus algorithm that can achieve rigorous $\epsilon$-differential privacy while maintaining accurate convergence, which, to our knowledge, has not been achieved before. Numerical simulation results on a demand response control problem in smart grid confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Safe Returning FaSTrack with Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time navigation in a priori unknown environment remains a challenging task, especially when an unexpected (unmodeled) disturbance occurs. In this paper, we propose the framework Safe Returning Fast and Safe Tracking (SR-F) that merges concepts from 1) Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Functions (R-CLVF), and 2) the Fast and Safe Tracking (FaSTrack) framework. The SR-F computes an R-CLVF offline between a model of the true system and a simplified planning model. Online, a planning algorithm is used to generate a trajectory in the simplified planning space, and the R-CLVF is used to provide a tracking controller that exponentially stabilizes to the planning model. When an unexpected disturbance occurs, the proposed SR-F algorithm provides a means for the true system to recover to the planning model. We take advantage of this mechanism to induce an artificial disturbance by ``jumping'' the planning model in open environments, forcing faster navigation. Therefore, this algorithm can both reject unexpected true disturbances and accelerate navigation speed. We validate our framework using a 10D quadrotor system and show that SR-F is empirically 20\% faster than the original FaSTrack while maintaining safety.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear integral extension of PID control with improved convergence of perturbed second-order dynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear extension of the integral part of PID feedback control is proposed for the perturbed second-order systems. For the matched constant perturbations, the global asymptotic stability is shown, and for Lipschitz perturbations an ultimately bounded output error is guaranteed. The second-order system plants can also be expanded by an additional (parasitic) actuator dynamics with low-pass characteristics. The proposed nonlinear control is proven to outperform its linear (PID) benchmarking counterpart during the settling phase, i.e. at convergence of the residual output error. An experimental case study of the second-order system with an additional actuator dynamics and considerable perturbation is demonstrated to confirm and benchmark the control performance.</description>

Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as an easy (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>

      <title>Proper Implicit Discretization of Arbitrary-Order Robust Exact Differentiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the implicit Euler discretization of Levant's arbitrary order robust exact differentiator in presence of sampled measurements. Existing implicit discretizations of that differentiator are shown to exhibit either unbounded bias errors or, surprisingly, discretization chattering despite the use of the implicit discretization. A new, proper implicit discretization that exhibits neither of these two detrimental effects is proposed by computing the differentiator's outputs as appropriately designed linear combinations of its state variables. A numerical differentiator implementation is discussed and closed-form stability conditions for arbitrary differentiation orders are given. The influence of bounded measurement noise and numerical approximation errors is formally analyzed. Numerical simulations confirm the obtained results.</description>

      <title>A Mean Field Game Model for Timely Computation in Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems constituting $N$ devices assisted by an edge server (ES), where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES. Since the local task execution and communication with the ES both consume power, each device must judiciously choose between the two. We model the problem as a large population non-cooperative game among the $N$ devices. Since computation of an equilibrium in this scenario is difficult due to the presence of a large number of devices, we employ the mean-field game framework to reduce the finite-agent game problem to a generic user's multi-objective optimization problem, with a coupled consistency condition. By leveraging the novel age of information (AoI) metric, we invoke techniques from stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) theory and study the tradeoffs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption. In numerical simulations, we validate that a higher load at the ES may lead devices to upload their task to the ES less often.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Output Control Barrier Functions from Safe Expert Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses learning safe output feedback control laws from partial observations of expert demonstrations. We assume that a model of the system dynamics and a state estimator are available along with corresponding error bounds, e.g., estimated from data in practice. We first propose robust output control barrier functions (ROCBFs) as a means to guarantee safety, as defined through controlled forward invariance of a safe set. We then formulate an optimization problem to learn ROCBFs from expert demonstrations that exhibit safe system behavior, e.g., data collected from a human operator or an expert controller. When the parametrization of the ROCBF is linear, then we show that, under mild assumptions, the optimization problem is convex. Along with the optimization problem, we provide verifiable conditions in terms of the density of the data, smoothness of the system model and state estimator, and the size of the error bounds that guarantee validity of the obtained ROCBF. Towards obtaining a practical control algorithm, we propose an algorithmic implementation of our theoretical framework that accounts for assumptions made in our framework in practice. We validate our algorithm in the autonomous driving simulator CARLA and demonstrate how to learn safe control laws from simulated RGB camera images.</description>

      <title>An active learning method for solving competitive multi-agent decision-making and control problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To identify a stationary action profile for a population of competitive agents, each executing private strategies, we introduce a novel active-learning scheme where a centralized external observer (or entity) can probe the agents' reactions and recursively update simple local parametric estimates of the action-reaction mappings. Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action-reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile. Extensive numerical simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision-making problems illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive MPC Using Uncertainty Compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an uncertainty compensation-based robust adaptive model predictive control (MPC) framework for linear systems with both matched and unmatched nonlinear uncertainties subject to both state and input constraints. In particular, the proposed control framework leverages an L1 adaptive controller (L1AC) to compensate for the matched uncertainties and to provide guaranteed uniform bounds on the error between the states and control inputs of the actual system and those of a nominal i.e., uncertainty-free, system. The performance bounds provided by the L1AC are then used to tighten the state and control constraints of the actual system, and a model predictive controller is designed for the nominal system with the tightened constraints. The proposed control framework, which we denote as uncertainty compensation-based MPC (UC-MPC), guarantees constraint satisfaction and achieves improved performance compared with existing methods. Simulation results on a flight control example demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe control with guarantees generally requires the system model to be known. It is far more challenging to handle systems with uncertain parameters. In this paper, we propose a generic algorithm that can synthesize and verify safe controllers for systems with constant, unknown parameters. In particular, we use robust-adaptive control barrier functions (raCBFs) to achieve safety. We develop new theories and techniques using sum-of-squares that enable us to pose synthesis and verification as a series of convex optimization problems. In our experiments, we show that our algorithms are general and scalable, applying them to three different polynomial systems of up to moderate size (7D). Our raCBFs are currently the most effective way to guarantee safety for uncertain systems, achieving 100% safety and up to 55% performance improvement over a robust baseline.</description>

      <title>On Complexity of Stability Analysis in Higher-order Ecological Networks through Tensor Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex ecological networks are often characterized by intricate interactions that extend beyond pairwise relationships. Understanding the stability of higher-order ecological networks is salient for species coexistence, biodiversity, and community persistence. In this article, we present complexity analyses for determining the linear stability of higher-order ecological networks through tensor decompositions. We are interested in the higher-order generalized Lotka-Volterra model, which captures high-order interactions using tensors of varying orders. To efficiently compute Jacobian matrices and thus determine stability in large ecological networks, we exploit various tensor decompositions, including higher-order singular value decomposition, Canonical Polyadic decomposition, and tensor train decomposition, accompanied by in-depth computational and memory complexity analyses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Highway Discretionary Lane-change Decision and Control Using Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enable autonomous vehicles to perform discretionary lane change amidst the random traffic flow on highways, this paper introduces a decision-making and control method for vehicle lane change based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). This approach divides the driving control of vehicles on highways into two parts: lane-change decision and lane-change control, both of which are solved using the MPC method. In the lanechange decision module, the minimum driving costs for each lane are computed and compared by solving the MPC problem to make lane-change decisions. In the lane-change control module, a dynamic bicycle model is incorporated, and a multi-objective cost function is designed to obtain the optimal control inputs for the lane-change process. Additionally, A long-short term memory (LSTM) model is used to predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles for both the MPC decision and control modules. The proposed lane-change decision and control method is simulated and validated in a driving simulator under random highway traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Locomotion Mode Transition in Quadruped Track-Legged Robots: A Simulation-Based Analysis for Step Negotiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.04235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid track/wheel-legged robots combine the advantages of wheel-based and leg-based locomotion, granting adaptability across varied terrains through efficient transitions between rolling and walking modes. However, automating these transitions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a method designed for autonomous mode transition in a quadruped hybrid robot with a track/wheel-legged configuration, especially during step negotiation. Our approach hinges on a decision-making mechanism that evaluates the energy efficiency of both locomotion modes using a proposed energy-based criterion. To guarantee a smooth negotiation of steps, we incorporate two climbing gaits designated for the assessment of energy usage in walking locomotion. Simulation results validate the method's effectiveness, showing successful autonomous transitions across steps of diverse heights. Our suggested approach has universal applicability and can be modified to suit other hybrid robots of similar mechanical configuration, provided their locomotion energy performance is studied beforehand.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Reconfiguration of Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To maintain a reliable grid we need fast decision-making algorithms for complex problems like Dynamic Reconfiguration (DyR). DyR optimizes distribution grid switch settings in real-time to minimize grid losses and dispatches resources to supply loads with available generation. DyR is a mixed-integer problem and can be computationally intractable to solve for large grids and at fast timescales. We propose GraPhyR, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNNs) framework tailored for DyR. We incorporate essential operational and connectivity constraints directly within the GNN framework and train it end-to-end. Our results show that GraPhyR is able to learn to optimize the DyR task.</description>
