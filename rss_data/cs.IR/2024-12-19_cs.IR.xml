      <title>Adaptive Two-Phase Finetuning LLMs for Japanese Legal Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text Retrieval (TR) involves finding and retrieving text-based content relevant to a user's query from a large repository, with applications in real-world scenarios such as legal document retrieval. While most existing studies focus on English, limited work addresses Japanese contexts. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset specifically designed for Japanese legal contexts and propose a novel two-phase pipeline tailored to this domain.
  In the first phase, the model learns a broad understanding of global contexts, enhancing its generalization and adaptability to diverse queries. In the second phase, the model is fine-tuned to address complex queries specific to legal scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which outperforms existing baselines.
  Furthermore, our pipeline proves effective in English contexts, surpassing comparable baselines on the MS MARCO dataset. We have made our code publicly available on GitHub, and the model checkpoints are accessible via HuggingFace.</description>

      <title>JudgeBlender: Ensembling Judgments for Automatic Relevance Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective training and evaluation of retrieval systems require a substantial amount of relevance judgments, which are traditionally collected from human assessors -- a process that is both costly and time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating relevance labels for search tasks, offering a potential alternative to manual assessments. Current approaches often rely on a single LLM, such as GPT-4, which, despite being effective, are expensive and prone to intra-model biases that can favour systems leveraging similar models. In this work, we introduce JudgeBlender, a framework that employs smaller, open-source models to provide relevance judgments by combining evaluations across multiple LLMs (LLMBlender) or multiple prompts (PromptBlender). By leveraging the LLMJudge benchmark [18], we compare JudgeBlender with state-of-the-art methods and the top performers in the LLMJudge challenge. Our results show that JudgeBlender achieves competitive performance, demonstrating that very large models are often unnecessary for reliable relevance assessments.</description>

      <title>Lightweight yet Fine-grained: A Graph Capsule Convolutional Network with Subspace Alignment for Shared-account Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared-account Sequential Recommendation (SSR) aims to provide personalized recommendations for accounts shared by multiple users with varying sequential preferences. Previous studies on SSR struggle to capture the fine-grained associations between interactions and different latent users within the shared account's hybrid sequences. Moreover, most existing SSR methods (e.g., RNN-based or GCN-based methods) have quadratic computational complexities, hindering the deployment of SSRs on resource-constrained devices. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Graph Capsule Convolutional Network with subspace alignment for shared-account sequential recommendation, named LightGC$^2$N. Specifically, we devise a lightweight graph capsule convolutional network. It facilitates the fine-grained matching between interactions and latent users by attentively propagating messages on the capsule graphs. Besides, we present an efficient subspace alignment method. This method refines the sequence representations and then aligns them with the finely clustered preferences of latent users. The experimental results on four real-world datasets indicate that LightGC$^2$N outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enhanced Recommender Systems: Taxonomy, Trend, Application and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) has transformative potential in various domains, including recommender systems (RS). There have been a handful of research that focuses on empowering the RS by LLM. However, previous efforts mainly focus on LLM as RS, which may face the challenge of intolerant inference costs by LLM. Recently, the integration of LLM into RS, known as LLM-Enhanced Recommender Systems (LLMERS), has garnered significant interest due to its potential to address latency and memory constraints in real-world applications. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the latest research efforts aimed at leveraging LLM to enhance RS capabilities. We identify a critical shift in the field with the move towards incorporating LLM into the online system, notably by avoiding their use during inference. Our survey categorizes the existing LLMERS approaches into three primary types based on the component of the RS model being augmented: Knowledge Enhancement, Interaction Enhancement, and Model Enhancement. We provide an in-depth analysis of each category, discussing the methodologies, challenges, and contributions of recent studies. Furthermore, we highlight several promising research directions that could further advance the field of LLMERS.</description>

      <title>Bridging the User-side Knowledge Gap in Knowledge-aware Recommendations with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, knowledge graphs have been integrated into recommender systems as item-side auxiliary information, enhancing recommendation accuracy. However, constructing and integrating structural user-side knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the improper granularity and inherent scarcity of user-side features. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to bridge this gap by leveraging their human behavior understanding and extensive real-world knowledge. Nevertheless, integrating LLM-generated information into recommender systems presents challenges, including the risk of noisy information and the need for additional knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based user-side knowledge inference method alongside a carefully designed recommendation framework to address these challenges. Our approach employs LLMs to infer user interests based on historical behaviors, integrating this user-side information with item-side and collaborative data to construct a hybrid structure: the Collaborative Interest Knowledge Graph (CIKG). Furthermore, we propose a CIKG-based recommendation framework that includes a user interest reconstruction module and a cross-domain contrastive learning module to mitigate potential noise and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competitive baselines, particularly for users with sparse interactions.</description>

      <title>Semantic Convergence: Harmonizing Recommender Systems via Two-Stage Alignment and Behavioral Semantic Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), endowed with exceptional reasoning capabilities, are adept at discerning profound user interests from historical behaviors, thereby presenting a promising avenue for the advancement of recommendation systems. However, a notable discrepancy persists between the sparse collaborative semantics typically found in recommendation systems and the dense token representations within LLMs. In our study, we propose a novel framework that harmoniously merges traditional recommendation models with the prowess of LLMs. We initiate this integration by transforming ItemIDs into sequences that align semantically with the LLMs space, through the proposed Alignment Tokenization module. Additionally, we design a series of specialized supervised learning tasks aimed at aligning collaborative signals with the subtleties of natural language semantics. To ensure practical applicability, we optimize online inference by pre-caching the top-K results for each user, reducing latency and improving effciency. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays remarkable scalability of recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For modern recommender systems, the use of low-dimensional latent representations to embed users and items based on their observed interactions has become commonplace. However, many existing recommendation models are primarily designed for coarse-grained and homogeneous interactions, which limits their effectiveness in two critical dimensions. Firstly, these models fail to leverage the relational dependencies that exist across different types of user behaviors, such as page views, collects, comments, and purchases. Secondly, they struggle to capture the fine-grained latent factors that drive user interaction patterns. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous graph collaborative filtering model MixRec that excels at disentangling users' multi-behavior interaction patterns and uncovering the latent intent factors behind each behavior. Our model achieves this by incorporating intent disentanglement and multi-behavior modeling, facilitated by a parameterized heterogeneous hypergraph architecture. Furthermore, we introduce a novel contrastive learning paradigm that adaptively explores the advantages of self-supervised data augmentation, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against data sparsity and expressiveness with relation heterogeneity. To validate the efficacy of MixRec, we conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets. The results clearly demonstrate its superior performance, significantly outperforming various state-of-the-art baselines. Our model is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/MixRec.</description>

      <title>Maybe you are looking for CroQS: Cross-modal Query Suggestion for Text-to-Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query suggestion, a technique widely adopted in information retrieval, enhances system interactivity and the browsing experience of document collections. In cross-modal retrieval, many works have focused on retrieving relevant items from natural language queries, while few have explored query suggestion solutions. In this work, we address query suggestion in cross-modal retrieval, introducing a novel task that focuses on suggesting minimal textual modifications needed to explore visually consistent subsets of the collection, following the premise of ''Maybe you are looking for''. To facilitate the evaluation and development of methods, we present a tailored benchmark named CroQS. This dataset comprises initial queries, grouped result sets, and human-defined suggested queries for each group. We establish dedicated metrics to rigorously evaluate the performance of various methods on this task, measuring representativeness, cluster specificity, and similarity of the suggested queries to the original ones. Baseline methods from related fields, such as image captioning and content summarization, are adapted for this task to provide reference performance scores. Although relatively far from human performance, our experiments reveal that both LLM-based and captioning-based methods achieve competitive results on CroQS, improving the recall on cluster specificity by more than 115% and representativeness mAP by more than 52% with respect to the initial query. The dataset, the implementation of the baseline methods and the notebooks containing our experiments are available here: https://paciosoft.com/CroQS-benchmark/</description>

      <title>CRM: Retrieval Model with Controllable Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems (RecSys) are designed to connect users with relevant items from a vast pool of candidates while aligning with the business goals of the platform. A typical industrial RecSys is composed of two main stages, retrieval and ranking: (1) the retrieval stage aims at searching hundreds of item candidates satisfied user interests; (2) based on the retrieved items, the ranking stage aims at selecting the best dozen items by multiple targets estimation for each item candidate, including classification and regression targets. Compared with ranking model, the retrieval model absence of item candidate information during inference, therefore retrieval models are often trained by classification target only (e.g., click-through rate), but failed to incorporate regression target (e.g., the expected watch-time), which limit the effectiveness of retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Controllable Retrieval Model (CRM), which integrates regression information as conditional features into the two-tower retrieval paradigm. This modification enables the retrieval stage could fulfill the target gap with ranking model, enhancing the retrieval model ability to search item candidates satisfied the user interests and condition effectively. We validate the effectiveness of CRM through real-world A/B testing and demonstrate its successful deployment in Kuaishou short-video recommendation system, which serves over 400 million users.</description>

      <title>A Cognitive Ideation Support Framework using IBM Watson Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ideas generation is a core activity for innovation in organizations. The creativity of the generated ideas depends not only on the knowledge retrieved from the organizations' knowledge bases, but also on the external knowledge retrieved from other resources. Unfortunately, organizations often cannot efficiently utilize the knowledge in the knowledge bases due to the limited abilities of the search and retrieval mechanisms especially when dealing with unstructured data. In this paper, we present a new cognitive support framework for ideation that uses the IBM Watson DeepQA services. IBM Watson is a Question Answering system which mimics human cognitive abilities to retrieve and rank information. The proposed framework is based on the Search for Ideas in the Associative Memory (SIAM) model to help organizations develop creative ideas through discovering new relationships between retrieved data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, the generated ideas generated are selected and assessed using a set of established creativity criteria.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Generative Clustering of Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present {\em generative clustering} (GC) for clustering a set of documents, $\mathrm{X}$, by using texts $\mathrm{Y}$ generated by large language models (LLMs) instead of by clustering the original documents $\mathrm{X}$. Because LLMs provide probability distributions, the similarity between two documents can be rigorously defined in an information-theoretic manner by the KL divergence. We also propose a natural, novel clustering algorithm by using importance sampling. We show that GC achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming any previous clustering method often by a large margin. Furthermore, we show an application to generative document retrieval in which documents are indexed via hierarchical clustering and our method improves the retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reverse Region-to-Entity Annotation for Pixel-Level Visual Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Entity Linking (VEL) is a crucial task for achieving fine-grained visual understanding, matching objects within images (visual mentions) to entities in a knowledge base. Previous VEL tasks rely on textual inputs, but writing queries for complex scenes can be challenging. Visual inputs like clicks or bounding boxes offer a more convenient alternative. Therefore, we propose a new task, Pixel-Level Visual Entity Linking (PL-VEL), which uses pixel masks from visual inputs to refer to objects, supplementing reference methods for VEL. To facilitate research on this task, we have constructed the MaskOVEN-Wiki dataset through an entirely automatic reverse region-entity annotation framework. This dataset contains over 5 million annotations aligning pixel-level regions with entity-level labels, which will advance visual understanding towards fine-grained. Moreover, as pixel masks correspond to semantic regions in an image, we enhance previous patch-interacted attention with region-interacted attention by a visual semantic tokenization approach. Manual evaluation results indicate that the reverse annotation framework achieved a 94.8% annotation success rate. Experimental results show that models trained on this dataset improved accuracy by 18 points compared to zero-shot models. Additionally, the semantic tokenization method achieved a 5-point accuracy improvement over the trained baseline.</description>

      <title>RAG-RewardBench: Benchmarking Reward Models in Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences. In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization. However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs. To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings. First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness. Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources. Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios. Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Hubness in Multi-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hubness is a phenomenon in high-dimensional vector spaces where a single point from the natural distribution is unusually close to many other points. This is a well-known problem in information retrieval that causes some items to accidentally (and incorrectly) appear relevant to many queries. In this paper, we investigate how attackers can exploit hubness to turn any image or audio input in a multi-modal retrieval system into an adversarial hub. Adversarial hubs can be used to inject universal adversarial content (e.g., spam) that will be retrieved in response to thousands of different queries, as well as for targeted attacks on queries related to specific, attacker-chosen concepts. We present a method for creating adversarial hubs and evaluate the resulting hubs on benchmark multi-modal retrieval datasets and an image-to-image retrieval system based on a tutorial from Pinecone, a popular vector database. For example, in text-caption-to-image retrieval, a single adversarial hub is retrieved as the top-1 most relevant image for more than 21,000 out of 25,000 test queries (by contrast, the most common natural hub is the top-1 response to only 102 queries). We also investigate whether techniques for mitigating natural hubness are an effective defense against adversarial hubs, and show that they are not effective against hubs that target queries related to specific concepts.</description>

      <title>DELRec: Distilling Sequential Pattern to Enhance LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) tasks aim to predict users' next interaction by learning their behavior sequence and capturing the connection between users' past interactions and their changing preferences. Conventional SR models often focus solely on capturing sequential patterns within the training data, neglecting the broader context and semantic information embedded in item titles from external sources. This limits their predictive power and adaptability. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in SR tasks due to their advanced understanding capabilities and strong generalization abilities. Researchers have attempted to enhance LLMs-based recommendation performance by incorporating information from conventional SR models. However, previous approaches have encountered problems such as 1) limited textual information leading to poor recommendation performance, 2) incomplete understanding and utilization of conventional SR model information by LLMs, and 3) excessive complexity and low interpretability of LLMs-based methods. To improve the performance of LLMs-based SR, we propose a novel framework, Distilling Sequential Pattern to Enhance LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation (DELRec), which aims to extract knowledge from conventional SR models and enable LLMs to easily comprehend and utilize the extracted knowledge for more effective SRs. DELRec consists of two main stages: 1) Distill Pattern from Conventional SR Models, focusing on extracting behavioral patterns exhibited by conventional SR models using soft prompts through two well-designed strategies; 2) LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation, aiming to fine-tune LLMs to effectively use the distilled auxiliary information to perform SR tasks. Extensive experimental results conducted on four real datasets validate the effectiveness of the DELRec framework.</description>

      <title>Lightning IR: Straightforward Fine-tuning and Inference of Transformer-based Language Models for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of transformer-based language models have been proposed for information retrieval tasks. However, including transformer-based models in retrieval pipelines is often complex and requires substantial engineering effort. In this paper, we introduce Lightning IR, an easy-to-use PyTorch Lightning-based framework for applying transformer-based language models in retrieval scenarios. Lightning IR provides a modular and extensible architecture that supports all stages of a retrieval pipeline: from fine-tuning and indexing to searching and re-ranking. Designed to be scalable and reproducible, Lightning IR is available as open-source: https://github.com/webis-de/lightning-ir.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Sequential Recommendation with Balanced Relevance and Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By generating new yet effective data, data augmentation has become a promising method to mitigate the data sparsity problem in sequential recommendation. Existing works focus on augmenting the original data but rarely explore the issue of imbalanced relevance and diversity for augmented data, leading to semantic drift problems or limited performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel Balanced data Augmentation Plugin for Sequential Recommendation (BASRec) to generate data that balance relevance and diversity. BASRec consists of two modules: Single-sequence Augmentation and Cross-sequence Augmentation. The former leverages the randomness of the heuristic operators to generate diverse sequences for a single user, after which the diverse and the original sequences are fused at the representation level to obtain relevance. Further, we devise a reweighting strategy to enable the model to learn the preferences based on the two properties adaptively. The Cross-sequence Augmentation performs nonlinear mixing between different sequence representations from two directions. It produces virtual sequence representations that are diverse enough but retain the vital semantics of the original sequences. These two modules enhance the model to discover fine-grained preferences knowledge from single-user and cross-user perspectives. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of BASRec. The average improvement is up to 72.0% on GRU4Rec, 33.8% on SASRec, and 68.5% on FMLP-Rec. We demonstrate that BASRec generates data with a better balance between relevance and diversity than existing methods.

      <title>One for Dozens: Adaptive REcommendation for All Domains with Counterfactual Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to enhance recommendation performance across various domains. However, real-world recommender systems in online platforms often need to handle dozens or even hundreds of domains, far exceeding the capabilities of traditional MDR algorithms, which typically focus on fewer than five domains. Key challenges include a substantial increase in parameter count, high maintenance costs, and intricate knowledge transfer patterns across domains. Furthermore, minor domains often suffer from data sparsity, leading to inadequate training in classical methods. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive REcommendation for All Domains with counterfactual augmentation (AREAD). AREAD employs a hierarchical structure with a limited number of expert networks at several layers, to effectively capture domain knowledge at different granularities. To adaptively capture the knowledge transfer pattern across domains, we generate and iteratively prune a hierarchical expert network selection mask for each domain during training. Additionally, counterfactual assumptions are used to augment data in minor domains, supporting their iterative mask pruning. Our experiments on two public datasets, each encompassing over twenty domains, demonstrate AREAD's effectiveness, especially in data-sparse domains. Source code is available at https://github.com/Chrissie-Law/AREAD-Multi-Domain-Recommendation.</description>

      <title>AIR-Bench: Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluation plays a crucial role in the advancement of information retrieval (IR) models. However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated. The testing data in AIR-Bench is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) without human intervention. 2) Heterogeneous. The testing data in AIR-Bench is generated with respect to diverse tasks, domains and languages. 3) Dynamic. The domains and languages covered by AIR-Bench are constantly augmented to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for community developers. We develop a reliable and robust data generation pipeline to automatically create diverse and high-quality evaluation datasets based on real-world corpora. Our findings demonstrate that the generated testing data in AIR-Bench aligns well with human-labeled testing data, making AIR-Bench a dependable benchmark for evaluating IR models. The resources in AIR-Bench are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-Bench/AIR-Bench.</description>

      <title>AdaCQR: Enhancing Query Reformulation for Conversational Search via Sparse and Dense Retrieval Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) has significantly advanced in addressing the challenges of conversational search, particularly those stemming from the latent user intent and the need for historical context. Recent works aimed to boost the performance of CRQ through alignment. However, they are designed for one specific retrieval system, which potentially results in poor generalization. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework AdaCQR. By aligning reformulation models with both term-based and semantic-based retrieval systems, AdaCQR enhances the generalizability of information-seeking queries across diverse retrieval environments through a dual-phase training strategy. We also developed two effective approaches for acquiring superior labels and diverse input candidates, boosting the efficiency and robustness of the framework. Experimental evaluations on the TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that AdaCQR significantly outperforms existing methods, offering both quantitative and qualitative improvements in conversational query reformulation.</description>

      <title>FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal multihop question answering is a complex task that requires reasoning over multiple sources of information, such as images and text, to answer questions. While there has been significant progress in visual question answering, the multihop setting remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current methods focus on single-hop question answering or a single modality, which makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios such as analyzing multimodal educational materials, summarizing lengthy academic articles, or interpreting scientific studies that combine charts, images, and text. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology, introducing the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset that enables training models for multimodal multihop question answering. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure quality data. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks, our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) on average. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating multimodal multihop question answering models.</description>

      <title>Methods to Assess the UK Government's Current Role as a Data Provider for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Governments typically collect and steward a vast amount of high-quality data on their citizens and institutions, and the UK government is exploring how it can better publish and provision this data to the benefit of the AI landscape. However, the compositions of generative AI training corpora remain closely guarded secrets, making the planning of data sharing initiatives difficult. To address this, we devise two methods to assess UK government data usage for the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) and 'peek behind the curtain' in order to observe the UK government's current contributions as a data provider for AI. The first method, an ablation study that utilises LLM 'unlearning', seeks to examine the importance of the information held on UK government websites for LLMs and their performance in citizen query tasks. The second method, an information leakage study, seeks to ascertain whether LLMs are aware of the information held in the datasets published on the UK government's open data initiative data.gov.uk. Our findings indicate that UK government websites are important data sources for AI (heterogenously across subject matters) while data.gov.uk is not. This paper serves as a technical report, explaining in-depth the designs, mechanics, and limitations of the above experiments. It is accompanied by a complementary non-technical report on the ODI website in which we summarise the experiments and key findings, interpret them, and build a set of actionable recommendations for the UK government to take forward as it seeks to design AI policy. While we focus on UK open government data, we believe that the methods introduced in this paper present a reproducible approach to tackle the opaqueness of AI training corpora and provide organisations a framework to evaluate and maximize their contributions to AI development.</description>

      <title>Boosting Long-Context Management via Query-Guided Activation Refilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.
  In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>EXIT: Context-Aware Extractive Compression for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce EXIT, an extractive context compression framework that enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (QA). Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely, existing extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent, non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from retrieved documents - while preserving their contextual dependencies - enabling parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks show that EXIT consistently surpasses existing compression methods and even uncompressed baselines in QA accuracy, while also delivering substantial reductions in inference time and token count. By improving both effectiveness and efficiency, EXIT provides a promising direction for developing scalable, high-quality QA solutions in RAG pipelines.
