      <title>A Polynomial Construction of Nerves for Higher Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the construction due to Leinster and Weber of a generalized Lawvere theory for a familially representable monad on a (co)presheaf category, and the associated ``nerve'' functor from monad algebras to (co)presheaves, have an elegant categorical description in the double category $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^{\#}$ of categories, cofunctors, familial functors, and transformations. In $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^{\#}$, which also arises from comonoids in the category of polynomial functors, both a familial monad and a (co)presheaf it acts on can be modeled as horizontal morphisms; from this perspective, the theory category associated to the monad is built using left Kan extension in the category of endomorphisms, and the nerve functor is modeled by a single composition of horizontal morphisms in $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^{\#}$. For the free category monad $path$ on graphs, this provides a new construction of the simplex category as $\Delta := \lens{path}{path \circ path}$. We also explore the free Eilenberg-Moore completion of $\mathbb{C}\mathbf{at}^{\#}$, in which constructions such as the free symmetric monoidal category monad on $\mathbf{Cat}$ can modeled using the rich language of polynomial functors.</description>

      <title>Partial actions of inverse categories and their algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce partial and global actions of inverse categories on posets in two variants, fibred actions and actions by symmetries. We study in detail actions of an inverse category $\mathcal{C}$ on specific subposets of the poset of finite subsets of $\mathcal{C}$, the Bernoulli actions. We show that to each fibred action of an inverse category on a poset there corresponds another inverse category, the semidirect product associated to the action. The Bernoulli actions give rise to the Szendrei expansions of $\mathcal{C}$, which define a endofunctor of the category of inverse categories. We extend the concept of enlargement from inverse semigroup theory to, and we show that if $\mathcal{D}$ is an enlargement of $\mathcal{C}$ then their Cauchy completions are equivalent categories; in particular, some pairs corresponding to partial and global Bernoulli actions are enlargements. We conclude by studying convolution algebras of finite inverse categories and showing that if $\mathcal{D}$ is an enlargement of $\mathcal{C}$ then their convolution algebras are Morita equivalent. Furthermore, using Kan extensions we also analyze the infinite case.</description>

      <title>Raney extensions of frames: topological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a pointfree approach to spaces which extends the category of $T_0$ spaces. Our pointfree objects are Raney extensions, pairs $(L,C)$ where $C$ is a coframe, $L\subseteq C$ is a frame which meet-generates it, and the inclusion $L\subseteq C$ preserves the frame operations as well as the strongly exact meets. We show that the category $\mathbf{Raney}$ extends that of $T_0$ spaces, by showing the existence of an adjunction which extends that between frames and spaces. We map a space $X$ to the pair $(\Omega(X),\mathcal{U}(X))$, where $\Omega(X)$ are its opens and $\mathcal{U}(X)$ its saturated sets. The spectrum functor $\mathsf{pt}_R$ maps a Raney extension $(L,C)$ to the collection of completely join-prime elements of $C$, suitably topologized. For a frame $L$ the spectra of the largest and the smallest Raney extensions over it are, respectively, the classical spectrum $\mathsf{pt}(L)$ and the $T_D$ spectrum $\mathsf{pt}_D(L)$.
  We characterize sobriety as well as the $T_D$ and the $T_1$ axioms for spaces in terms of algebraic properties of their Raney duals. We use this to define sobriety for general Raney extensions, as well as the $T_D$ and $T_1$ properties, and show that a sober coreflection always exists, whereas a $T_D$ reflection exists when we restrict morphisms to exact maps. We show that a frame is subfit if and only if it admits a $T_1$ Raney extension, and that a subfit frame is scattered if and only if it admits a unique Raney extension.
  We show that the dual adjunction between frames and spaces restricts to a dual adjunction between the category of $T_D$ spaces and the category of $\mathbf{Frm}_{\mathcal{E}}$ of frames and exact maps, and that exact sublocales (sublocales whose surjection is exact) form a subcolocale of the coframe of all sublocales.</description>

      <title>Measuring data types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we combine Sweedler's classic theory of measuring coalgebras -- by which $k$-algebras are enriched in $k$-coalgebras for $k$ a field -- with the theory of W-types -- by which the categorical semantics of inductive data types in functional programming languages are understood. In our main theorem, we find that under some hypotheses, algebras of an endofunctor are enriched in coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and we find polynomial endofunctors provide many interesting examples of this phenomenon. We then generalize the notion of initial algebra of an endofunctor using this enrichment, thus generalizing the notion of W-type. This article is an extended version of arXiv:2303.16793, it adds expository introductions to the original theories of measuring coalgebras and W-types along with some improvements to the main theory and many explicitly worked examples.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on finite state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (= multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an operad of spliced arrows $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NDFA is a functor satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties, from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C} : Oper \to Cat$, which we call the contour category construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of tree contour words. This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows iff it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>

      <title>Homological algebra of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups from the perspective of homological algebra. We extend to this context the type-decomposition of locally compact Polish abelian groups of Hoffmann and Spitzweck, and prove that the category $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups is a thick subcategory of the category of Polish abelian groups. We completely characterize injective and projective objects in $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$. We conclude that $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ has enough projectives but not enough injectives and homological dimension $1$. We also completely characterize injective and projective objects in the category of non-Archimedean Polish abelian groups, concluding that it has enough injectives and projectives and homological dimension $1$. Injective objects are also characterized for the categories of topological torsion Polish abelian groups and for Polish abelian topological $p$-groups, showing that these categories have enough injectives and homological dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>The Ziegler spectrum for enriched ringoids and schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ziegler spectrum for categories enriched in closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck categories is defined and studied in this paper. It recovers the classical Ziegler spectrum of a ring. As an application, the Ziegler spectrum as well as the category of generalised quasi-coherent sheaves of a reasonable scheme is introduced and studied. It is shown that there is a closed embedding of the injective spectrum of a coherent scheme endowed with the tensor fl-topology (respectively of a noetherian scheme endowed with the dual Zariski topology) into its Ziegler spectrum. It is also shown that quasi-coherent sheaves and generalised quasi-coherent sheaves are related to each other by a recollement.</description>

Abstract: There is an action of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ on the category of Soergel Bimodules of type $A_1 \times A_1$ induced by the nontrivial automorphism of its Dynkin diagram. We give an isotopy presentation by local generators and relations of the equivariantization of the category of Soergel Bimodules of type $A_1 \times A_1$ under this action. This is the first step in a program to describe and study the categories of equivariant Soergel Bimodules.</description>

      <title>The oplax limit of an enriched category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that 2-categories of the form $\mathscr{B}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Cat}$ are closed under slicing, provided that we allow $\mathscr{B}$ to range over bicategories (rather than, say, monoidal categories). That is, for any $\mathscr{B}$-category $\mathbb{X}$, we define a bicategory $\mathscr{B}/\mathbb{X}$ such that $\mathscr{B}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Cat}/\mathbb{X}\cong (\mathscr{B}/\mathbb{X})\mbox{-}\mathbf{Cat}$. The bicategory $\mathscr{B}/\mathbb{X}$ is characterized as the oplax limit of $\mathbb{X}$, regarded as a lax functor from a chaotic category to $\mathscr{B}$, in the 2-category $\mathbf{BICAT}$ of bicategories, lax functors and icons. We prove this conceptually, through limit-preservation properties of the 2-functor $\mathbf{BICAT}\to 2\mbox{-}\mathbf{CAT}$ which maps each bicategory $\mathscr{B}$ to the 2-category $\mathscr{B}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Cat}$. When $\mathscr{B}$ satisfies a mild local completeness condition, we also show that the isomorphism $\mathscr{B}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Cat}/\mathbb{X}\cong (\mathscr{B}/\mathbb{X})\mbox{-}\mathbf{Cat}$ restricts to a correspondence between fibrations in $\mathscr{B}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Cat}$ over $\mathbb{X}$ on the one hand, and $\mathscr{B}/\mathbb{X}$-categories admitting certain powers on the other.</description>

Abstract: For a big tt-category, we give a characterization of the Telescope Conjecture (TC) in terms of definable tensor-ideals generated by homological residue fields. We formulate a stalk-locality property of (TC) and prove that it holds in the case of the derived category of a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme, strengthening a result \cite{HHZ21}. As an application, we find strong links between (TC) and separation properties of the adic topology on local rings. This allows us to recover known examples and counterexamples of when (TC) holds over a scheme, as well as to construct some new ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a tensor structure for the Serre quotient category of an abelian monoidal category with biexact tensor product to make the canonical functor a monoidal functor. In this tensor product, the Serre quotient category of a multiring category (resp. a multitensor category) by a two-sided Serre tensor-ideal is still a multiring category (resp. a multitensor category). Besides, a two-sided Serre tensor-ideal of a tensor category is always trivial. This result can be generalized to any tensor product. If the canonical functor is a monoidal functor, then the corresponding Serre subcategory of the tensor category is trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce monoidal streams. Monoidal streams are a generalization of causal stream functions, which can be defined in cartesian monoidal categories, to arbitrary symmetric monoidal categories. In the same way that streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with pure functions, monoidal streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with theories of processes represented by a symmetric monoidal category. Monoidal streams also form a feedback monoidal category. In the same way that we can use a coinductive stream calculus to reason about signal flow graphs, we can use coinductive string diagrams to reason about feedback monoidal categories. As an example, we study syntax for a stochastic dataflow language, with semantics in stochastic monoidal streams.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a categorification of Robertson's conjecture analogous to the categorical graph minor conjecture of Miyata--Proudfood--Ramos. We show that these conjectures imply the existence of a finite list of atomic graphs generating the homology of configuration spaces of graphs -- in fixed degree, with a fixed number of particles, under topological embeddings. We explain how the simplest case of our conjecture follows from work of Barter and Miyata--Proudfoot, implying that the category of cographs is Noetherian, a result of potential independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify morphisms of strong profunctors as a categorification of quantum supermaps. These black-box generalisations of diagrams-with-holes are hence placed within the broader field of profunctor optics, as morphisms in the category of copresheaves on concrete networks. This enables the first construction of abstract logical connectives such as tensor products and negations for supermaps in a totally theory-independent setting. These logical connectives are found to be all that is needed to abstractly model the key structural features of the quantum theory of supermaps: black-box indefinite causal order, black-box definite causal order, and the factorisation of definitely causally ordered supermaps into concrete circuit diagrams. We demonstrate that at the heart of these factorisation theorems lies the Yoneda lemma and the notion of representability.</description>

Abstract: Proving compositionality of behavioral equivalence on state-based systems with respect to algebraic operations is a classical and widely studied problem. We study a categorical formulation of this problem, where operations on state-based systems modeled as coalgebras can be elegantly captured through distributive laws between functors. To prove compositionality, it then suffices to show that this distributive law lifts from sets to relations, giving an explanation of how behavioral equivalence on smaller systems can be combined to obtain behavioral equivalence on the composed system.
  In this paper, we refine this approach by focusing on so-called codensity lifting of functors, which gives a very generic presentation of various notions of (bi)similarity as well as quantitative notions such as behavioral metrics on probabilistic systems. The key idea is to use codensity liftings both at the level of algebras and coalgebras, using a new generalization of the codensity lifting. The problem of lifting distributive laws then reduces to the abstract problem of constructing distributive laws between codensity liftings, for which we propose a simplified sufficient condition. Our sufficient condition instantiates to concrete proof methods for compositionality of algebraic operations on various types of state-based systems. We instantiate our results to prove compositionality of qualitative and quantitative properties of deterministic automata. We also explore the limits of our approach by including an example of probabilistic systems, where it is unclear whether the sufficient condition holds, and instead we use our setting to give a direct proof of compositionality. ...</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on the $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>
