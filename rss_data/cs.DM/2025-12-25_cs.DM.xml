      <title>Fairness in the k-Server Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a formal study of fairness for the $k$-server problem, where the objective is not only to minimize the total movement cost, but also to distribute the cost equitably among servers. We first define a general notion of $(\alpha,\beta)$-fairness, where, for parameters $\alpha \ge 1$ and $\beta \ge 0$, no server incurs more than an $\alpha/k$-fraction of the total cost plus an additive term $\beta$. We then show that fairness can be achieved without a loss in competitiveness in both the offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we give a deterministic algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, transforms any optimal solution into an $(\alpha,\beta)$-fair solution for $\alpha = 1 + \varepsilon$ and $\beta = O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot \log k / \varepsilon)$, while increasing the cost of the solution by just an additive $O(\mathrm{diam} \cdot k \log k / \varepsilon)$ term. Here $\mathrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the underlying metric space. We give a similar result in the online setting, showing that any competitive algorithm can be transformed into a randomized online algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary and still competitive up to a small loss.
  The above results leave open a significant question: can fairness be achieved in the online setting, either with a deterministic algorithm or a randomized algorithm, against a fully adaptive adversary? We make progress towards answering this question, showing that the classic deterministic Double Coverage Algorithm (DCA) is fair on line metrics and on tree metrics when $k = 2$. However, we also show a negative result: DCA fails to be fair for any non-vacuous parameters on general tree metrics.</description>

      <title>p-complete square-free Word-representation of Word-representable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph G(V, E) is word-representable if there exists a word w over V such that distinct letters x and y alternate in w iff $xy \in E$. We introduce p-complete squares and p-complete square-free word-representable graphs. A word is p-complete square-free if no induced subword over any subset of letters contains a square XX with $|X| \ge p$. A graph is p-complete square-free if it admits such a representation. We define p-complete square-free uniform word-representations and study their properties. We show that any graph admitting such a representation forbids Kp as an induced subgraph and that the recognition problem is NP-hard for arbitrary p. For p=1 and 2, we give complete characterisations. We prove that every $K_p$-free circle graph admits a p-complete square-free uniform representation and that any 3-complete square-free uniform word-representable graph has representation number at most three. We present a constructive method for generating new examples for p=3.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <title>Awesome graph parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, we denote by $\alpha(G)$ the size of a maximum independent set and by $\omega(G)$ the size of a maximum clique in $G$. Our paper lies on the edge of two lines of research, related to $\alpha$ and $\omega$, respectively. One of them studies $\alpha$-variants of graph parameters, such as $\alpha$-treewidth or $\alpha$-degeneracy. The second line deals with graph classes where some parameters are bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$. A famous example of this type is the family of $\chi$-bounded classes, where the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$.
  A Ramsey-type argument implies that if the $\alpha$-variant of a graph parameter $\rho$ is bounded by a constant in a class $\mathcal{G}$, then $\rho$ is bounded by a function of $\omega$ in $\mathcal{G}$. If the reverse implication also holds, we say that $\rho$ is awesome. Otherwise, we say that $\rho$ is awful. In the present paper, we identify a number of awesome and awful graph parameters, derive some algorithmic applications of awesomeness, and propose a number of open problems related to these notions.</description>

      <title>On the Incompressibility of Truth With Application to Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamentals of Circuit Complexity and the nature of efficient computation from a fresh perspective. We present a framework for understanding Circuit Complexity through the lens of Information Theory with analogies to results in Kolmogorov Complexity, viewing circuits as descriptions of truth tables, encoded in logical gates and wires, rather than purely computational devices. From this framework, we re-prove some existing Circuit Complexity bounds, explain what the optimal circuits for most boolean functions look like structurally, give an explicit boolean function family that requires exponential circuits, and explain the aforementioned results in a unifying intuition that re-frames time entirely.</description>
