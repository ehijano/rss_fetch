      <title>Weak countability axioms on the quotient spaces of topological gyrogroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly prove that if $H$ is a closed strong subgyrogroup of a strongly topological gyrogroup $G$ and $H$ is neutral, then
  (1) $G/H$ is biradial if and only if $G/H$ is nested;
  (2) $G/H$ is metrizable if and only if $G/H$ is a biradial space with countable pseudocharacter;
  (3) $G/H$ is metrizable if and only if $G/H$ has countable $cn$-character, given that $G/H$ has the Baire property.</description>

      <title>Function theory, Dynamics and Ergodic theory via Thurston theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss function theory on Teichm\"uller space through Thurston's theory, as well as the dynamics of subgroups of the mapping class group of a surface, with reference to Sullivan's theory on the ergodic actions of discrete subgroups of the isometry group of hyperbolic space at infinity.</description>

      <title>On resolvability and tightness in uncountable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate connections between resolvability and different forms of tightness. This study is adjacent to [1,2].
  We construct a non-regular refinement $\tau^*$ of the natural topology of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ with properties such that the space $(\mathbb{R}, \tau^*)$ has a hereditary nowhere dense tightness and it has no $\omega_1$-resolvable subspaces, whereas $\Delta(\mathbb{R}, \tau^*) = \frak{c}$.
  We also show that the proof of the main result of [1], being slightly modified, leads to the following strengthening: if $L$ is a Hausdorff space of countable character and the space $L^\omega$ is c.c.c., then every submaximal dense subspace of $L^\kappa$ has disjoint tightness. As a corollary, for every $\kappa \geq \omega$ there is a Tychonoff submaximal space $X$ such that $|X|=\Delta(X)=\kappa$ and $X$ has disjoint tightness.</description>

      <title>Enveloping Ellis semigroups as compactifications of transformations groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a proper Ellis semigroup compactification is introduced. Ellis's functional approach shows how to obtain them from totally bounded equiuniformities on a phase space $X$ when the acting group $G$ is with the topology of pointwise convergence and the $G$-space $(G, X, \curvearrowright)$ is $G$-Tychonoff.
  The correspondence between proper Ellis semigroup compactifications of a topological group and special totally bounded equiuniformities (called Ellis equiuniformities) on a topological group is established. The Ellis equiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal equiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly equicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\,(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\,(X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology. It is shown that this approach can be applied to the unitary group of a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>On two methods of constructing compactifications of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of (proper) compactifications of topological groups with respect to the possibility of extensions of algebraic operations is presented. Ellis' method of construction compactifications of topological groups allows one to obtain all right topological semigroup compactifications on which the multiplication on the left continuously extends. Presentation of group elements as graphs of maps in the hyperspace with Vietoris topology allows one to obtain compactifications on which the involution and the multiplication on the left extend.</description>

      <title>An Adaptation of the Vietoris Topology for Ordered Compact Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural topology on powers of a space that is inspired by the Vietoris topology on compact subsets. We then place this topology in context with other product topologies; specifically, we compare this topology with the Tychonoff product, the box product, and Bell's uniform box topology. We identify a variety of topological properties for the specific case when the ground space is discrete. When the ground space is the Euclidean real line, we show that the resulting power is not Lindel\"{o}f, and hence, not Menger. This shows that, unlike the the Vietoris topology on unordered compact subsets, covering properties of the ground space need not transfer to the Vietoris power.</description>
