      <title>Confinement-controlled chase-escape dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal chase-and-escape model on a two-dimensional square lattice with randomly distributed static obstacles, focusing on how geometric disorder controls collective pursuit dynamics. Chasers and escapers move according to short-range sensing rules, while the density of obstacles tunes the connectivity of the accessible space. Using a combination of geometric analysis, dynamical observables, survival statistics, and transport characterization, we establish a direct link between lattice connectivity and pursuit efficiency. A Breadth-First Search analysis reveals that obstacle-induced fragmentation leads to a progressive loss of accessibility before the percolation threshold, defining the effective initial conditions for the dynamics. The trapping time and capture cost exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on obstacle density, reflecting a competition between path elongation in connected environments and geometric confinement near the percolation threshold. Survival analysis shows that the decay of the escaper population follows a Weibull form, with characteristic time and shape parameters displaying clear crossovers as a function of obstacle density, signaling the coexistence of cooperative capture and confinement-dominated trapping. Transport properties, quantified through the mean-squared displacement exponent, further support this picture, revealing sub-diffusive dynamics and a convergence toward a geometry-controlled regime near percolation. Overall, our results demonstrate that chase--and--escape dynamics in disordered environments are governed by a geometry-driven crossover, where percolation and connectivity act as unifying control parameters for spatial, temporal, and collective behavior.</description>

      <title>A Lindblad and Non-Hermitian Spectral Framework for Fragmentation Dynamics and Particle Size Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population balance equations (PBEs) for pure fragmentation describe how particle size distributions (PSDs) evolve under breakage and fragment redistribution. We map a self-similar fragmentation class to: a conservative pure-jump master equation in log-size space; an exact Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) dilation whose diagonal sector reproduces that master equation; and a controlled small-jump limit where the dynamics reduce to a Fokker-Planck operator that can be symmetrized into a Schrodinger-type spectral problem.
  Two points ensure correctness and applicability. First, the Lindblad embedding is exact when the daughter kernel is interpreted in mass-weighted form (equivalently, when z*kappa(z) is a probability measure). Second, for genuinely non-Hermitian dynamics the stationary PSD is naturally a biorthogonal product of left and right ground states, not a naive modulus square; the usual modulus squared of psi appears only in pseudo-Hermitian or effectively dephased regimes.
  We then give a spectral dictionary linking typical PSD shapes to low-dimensional potential families in log-size space and outline inverse routes to infer effective potentials from data: parametric fitting with time-resolved PSDs, a direct steady-state inversion from a smoothed PSD, and an outlook toward inverse spectral ideas. A synthetic example demonstrates forward simulation and inverse parameter recovery in an Airy-type half-line model.</description>

Abstract: Random walks in random environments (RWRE) model transport in quenched disorder, incorporating spatial heterogeneity, trapping, random drift, and random geometry. This paper summarizes discrete and continuous time formulations, identifies principal transport regimes through quantitative observables (velocity, diffusivity, mean-square displacement, first-passage, large deviations, aging), and reviews core methods in one dimension (potential/valley mechanisms) and in higher dimensions (environment-seen-from-the-particle, correctors/homogenization, regeneration and ballisticity criteria).</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Dissipation Limits in Quantum Thermoelectric Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental measure of stability in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, fluctuations provide critical insight into the performance and reliability of heat engines. In this work, we establish universal fluctuation-dissipation bounds that directly link energy-current fluctuations to both the entropy production rate and steady-state transport currents. Our results are applicable to arbitrary temperature and chemical potential gradients and hold for all steady states within the framework of quantum scattering theory. These bounds remain robust even in regimes where quantum effects break classical thermodynamic uncertainty relations. We demonstrate their validity by using boxcar transmission functions and further derive constraints on the power output from the perspective of fluctuations and dissipation, offering a unified thermodynamic guideline for the design and evaluation of nanoscale and quantum thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of Euler characteristic of finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term \emph{dynamic redundancy and mortality} (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>Derivation and Analysis of Amplitude Equation for Generalized AMB+ in Presence of Chemical Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyze the amplitude equation for the roll patterns in case of generalized Active Model B+ (AMB+) in the presence of chemical reactions. The generalized AMB+ differs from the original AMB+ introduced by Tjhung \textit{et al.} [E. Tjhung \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X \textbf{8}, 031080 (2018)] by the addition of a quadratic term, $g\phi^2$, in the expression for the equilibrium part of the current. Also, the model includes a rotation-free active current of strength $\lambda$ and a rotational current of strength $\xi$. The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $\Gamma$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $\Gamma_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $\lambda$, and $\xi$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability. We find that for $g = 0$, the transition is always supercritical, whereas for $g \ne 0$, the transition between the supercritical and subcritical regimes depends sensitively on the model parameters. Further, we derive the condition for the \textit{Eckhaus instability} from the stability analysis of the amplitude equation as well as from the phase diffusion equation, and find that it is independent of $g$.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driven shifts of the Potts transition on spherical Fibonacci graphs: a graph-convolutional transfer-learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on spherical Fibonacci graphs. These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q&gt;4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length.</description>

      <title>Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</description>

      <title>Comminution as a Non-Hermitian Quantum Field Theory: Log-Size Jump Generators, Branching Embeddings, and the Airy Solvable Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure-breakage population balance equations (PBEs) give the standard deterministic description of fragmentation and comminution. They predict mean particle size distributions, but they do not determine fluctuations, size-size correlations, or universality under coarse-graining. We develop a field-theoretic framework anchored in the PBE kernel inputs (selection rate and daughter distribution) and compatible with the stochastic Doi-Peliti approach.
  From homogeneous kernels we derive an exact Markov jump generator in log-size for a mass-weighted (tagged-mass) distribution, with a jump law that is a probability density fixed by the daughter distribution. The generator is generically non-self-adjoint, admits a Lindblad embedding, and has a second-quantized extension. The deterministic PBE appears as the one-body sector, while multi-point correlators encode finite-population fluctuations. We also give a binary-fragmentation embedding whose mean-field limit reproduces the PBE but whose higher correlators capture multiplicative cascade noise. For a linear Airy-type kernel, long-wavelength coarse-graining yields an effective Airy operator as a solvable quadratic sector about a stationary profile, producing explicit mode-sum formulas for equal-time connected two-point correlations. Overall, the framework separates what is fixed by kernel data from what requires additional stochastic modeling and links comminution kernels to universality classes.</description>

      <title>In-context learning emerges in chemical reaction networks without attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether chemical processes can perform in-context learning (ICL), a mode of computation typically associated with transformer architectures. ICL allows a system to infer task-specific rules from a sequence of examples without relying solely on fixed parameters. Traditional ICL relies on a pairwise attention mechanism which is not obviously implementable in chemical systems. However, we show theoretically and numerically that chemical processes can achieve ICL through a mechanism we call subspace projection, in which the entire input vector is mapped onto comparison subspaces, with the dominant projection determining the computational output. We illustrate this mechanism analytically in small chemical systems and show numerically that performance is robust to input encoding and dynamical choices, with the number of tunable degrees of freedom in the input encoding as a key limitation. Our results provide a blueprint for realizing ICL in chemical or other physical media and suggest new directions for designing adaptive synthetic chemical systems and understanding possible biological computation in cells.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Correlation of the Post-quench Non-thermal Equilibrium State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After a quantum quench, the integrable system is expected to relax to a non-thermal equilibrium state (NTES) whose local properties are believed to be governed by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Combining quench action and the form factor approach, we compute the field-field correlation in the NTES produced by an interaction quench of the Lieb-Liniger model. The spectral distribution is shown to be qualitatively different from that of a thermal equilibrium state (TES): a new dispersion branch appears whose microscopic mechanism can be traced to the algebraic decaying tail for the root density distribution function, and indicates the existence of a broader family of NTES featuring similar spectral property.</description>

      <title>Approximate FKG inequalities for phase-bound spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization.
  In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model.</description>

      <title>Direct temperature readout in nonequilibrium quantum thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims to measure temperature in nanoscale quantum systems, paralleling classical thermometry. However, temperature is not a quantum observable, and most theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on analyzing fundamental precision limits set by the quantum Fisher information through the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. In contrast, whether a direct temperature readout can be achieved in quantum thermometry remains largely unexplored, particularly under the nonequilibrium conditions prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we develop a direct temperature readout scheme based on a thermodynamic inference strategy. The scheme integrates two conceptual developments: (i) By applying the maximum entropy principle with the thermometer's mean energy as a constraint, we assign a reference temperature to the nonequilibrium thermometer. We demonstrate that this reference temperature outperforms a commonly used effective temperature defined through equilibrium analogy. (ii) We obtain positive semi-definite error functions that lower-bound the deviation of the reference temperature from the true temperature-in analogy to the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for the mean squared error-and vanish upon thermalization with the sample. Combining the reference temperature with these error functions, we introduce a notion of corrected dynamical temperature which furnishes a postprocessed temperature readout under nonequilibrium conditions. We validate the corrected dynamical temperature in a qubit-based thermometer under a range of nonequilibrium initial states, confirming its capability to estimate the true temperature. Importantly, we find that increasing quantum coherence can enhance the precision of this readout.</description>

      <title>Noise enhances odor source localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of single-particle and collective dynamics in arrested phase-separating glassy mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and dynamics of a hard colloid--star polymer mixture in the range of its arrested phase separation, where an incipient demixing transition is interfering with a nearby vitrification line, focusing on the protein limit (smaller hard component). Soft-hard mixtures present a rich dynamics, influenced by different parameters such as the concentration of the soft and hard components, the softness of the potential, and the size ratio between the two components. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize the single-particle and collective dynamics of the hard colloidal tracers in the soft glassy matrix. The hard tracers show diffusive behavior of the mean squared displacement accompanied by non-exponential relaxation of the intermediate scattering functions at intermediate length scales and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Moreover, we show that the system exhibits arrested phase separation, leading to population splitting and decoupling between self- and collective dynamics of the hard colloids. Overall, we demonstrate that the interplay between arrested phase separation and glassiness leads to complex, multiscale phenomena that strongly influence the dynamics of the hard additives in the arrested matrix formed by the soft colloids.</description>

      <title>Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description>

      <title>Computing quantum magic of state vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods reduce the runtime to $O(N d^{2N})$, an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, while exposing substantial parallelism and enabling GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG.jl, which provides a high-performance, GPU-enabled toolbox for computing SRE and mana. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Interface roughening in the 3-D Ising model with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfaces in three-dimensional many-body systems can exhibit rich phenomena beyond the corresponding bulk properties. In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Active Brownian Particles Crossing a Parabolic Barrier: Finite Rectangular Domain with Absorbing Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation for a two-dimensional active Brownian particle exploring a rectangular domain with absorbing boundary and in the presence of a parabolic barrier along one direction. By taking those of a passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, we provide a matrix representation of the Fokker-Planck operator and express the propagator in terms of the perturbed eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage-time distribution. The non-equilibrium character of the dynamics induces a strong dependence of the latter quantities on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a single inertial probe driven into a nonequilibrium steady-state by random collisions with self-propelled active walkers. The probe and walkers are confined within a gravitational harmonic potential. We evaluate the robustness of the effective temperature concept in this active system by comparing values of distinct, independently motivated definitions: a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation, a kinetic temperature, and a work fluctuation relation. Our experiments reveal that, under specific conditions, these independent measurements yield a remarkably consistent effective temperature over a wide range of system configurations. Furthermore, we also identify regimes where this consistency breaks down, which delineates the fundamental limits of extending equilibrium-like thermodynamic concepts to athermal, actively driven systems.</description>

      <title>Average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset of quantum ergodicity is often quantified by the average ratio of consecutive level spacings. The reference values for ergodic quantum systems have been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional random matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for random matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlev\'e differential equation is solved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic quantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry (provided that the time-reversal operator squares to the identity matrix). A Wigner surmise-inspired analytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for the statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry classes. For Poissonian level statistics, a significantly different average is found, indicating that the average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings can be used as a probe for quantum ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Julia Set in Quantum Evolution: The case of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider overdamped physical systems evolving under a feedback-controlled fluctuating potential and in contact with a thermal bath at temperature $T$. A Markovian description of the dynamics, which keeps only the last value of the control action, is advantageous -- both from the theoretical and the practical side -- for the entropy balance. Novel second-law equalities and bounds for the extractable work are obtained, the latter being both tighter and easier to evaluate than those in the literature based on the whole chain of controller actions. The Markovian framework also allows us to prove that the bound for the extractable work that incorporates the unavailable information is saturated in a wide class of physical systems, for error-free measurements. These results are illustrated in model systems. For imperfect measurements, there appears an interval of measurement uncertainty, including the point at which work ceases to be extracted, where the new Markovian bound is tighter than the unavailable information bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of generalized thermodynamics is explored here in the context of 1d, 2d and 3d data analysis, performed on samples drawn from a 3d X-ray soil sample image. Different threshold levels are used to binarize the 3d sample, wherefrom relative frequencies of binary patterns are found and then used to address finite size scaling behavior of the response functions as a function of the disorder parameter (equivalent of temperature in thermodynamics). It is found that for different threshold levels response functions for increasing sample sizes approach the thermodynamic limit from different directions, with a crossover reminiscent of a transition from open to periodic boundaries of the Ising model, implying existence of a characteristic correlation scale. It is argued here that this characteristic scale corresponds to the "natural" properties of the data, where correlations within finite size samples are neither underestimated nor overestimated. In the current context of soil this scale may be related to the so-called Representative elementary volume (REV), while in other situations this characteristic scale should be interpreted in the context of the phenomenon under study.</description>

Abstract: When a gas of particles interacts with much a larger reservoir the density dynamics on large scales is typically governed by diffusion. We study this paradigmatic problem for weakly coupled integrable systems and show that this picture gets altered, when transport is investigated on top of long-lived non-thermal states. Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear advective coefficient of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find an excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath particles during two-body scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistics of extinction and blowup times in well-mixed systems of stochastically reacting particles. We focus on the short-time tail, $T \to 0$, of the extinction- or blowup-time distribution $\mathcal{P}_m(T)$, where $m$ is the number of particles at $t=0$. This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations.</description>

Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades. The recent rise of large language models has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities. However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking. In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics, we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context-sensitive grammars, which we call the context-sensitive random language model, and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model. We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly zero to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider. Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase. This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but are generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variance of the number of particles in a set is an important quantity in understanding the statistics of non-interacting fermionic systems in low dimensions. An exact map of their ground state in a harmonic trap in one and two dimensions to the classical Gaussian unitary and complex Ginibre ensemble, respectively, allows to determine the counting statistics at finite and infinite system size. We will establish two new results in this setup. First, we uncover an interpolating central limit theorem between known results in one and two dimensions, for linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble. We find an entire range of interpolating weak non-Hermiticity limits, given by a two-parameter family for the mesoscopic scaling regime. Second, we considerably generalize the proportionality between the number variance and the entanglement entropy between Fermions in a set $A$ and its complement in two dimensions. Previously known only for rotationally invariant sets and external potentials, we prove a holographic principle for general non-rotationally invariant sets and random normal matrices. It states that both number variance and entanglement entropy are proportional to the circumference of $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that heat defines a gauge connection on a line bundle over work configurations. Vanishing curvature is equivalent to the local existence of entropy and temperature functions such that heat can be expressed as $TdS$. A conjecture of Jauch, that entropy and temperature arise from a conservation law, is shown to follow as a special case. Global equilibrium may nevertheless fail in the presence of a thermal analogue of geometric phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description>

      <title>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) -- a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <title>Attaining Quantum Sensing Enhancement from Monitored Dissipative Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates quantum-enhanced parameter estimation through continuous monitoring in open quantum systems that exhibit a dissipative time crystal phase. We first analytically derive the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) rate for boundary time crystals (BTCs), demonstrating that within the time-crystal phase, the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$. We then generalize this finding to a broader class of dynamics, including the transverse collective dephasing (TCD) model, which achieves a time-crystal phase through a closing Liouvillian gap without requiring a dissipative phase transition. We proceed to numerically demonstrate that this maximal global QFI rate is experimentally attainable for both the BTC and TCD models, even at finite system sizes, via continuous homodyne and photodetection. Moving towards practical implementations, we analyze the precision limits under inefficient detection, revealing a critical difference: for BTC dynamics, inefficiencies asymptotically restore a classical scaling, and only a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible. In contrast, for TCD dynamics, a super-classical scaling is still in principle observable, and our numerical simulations confirm its presence, even under inefficient measurement conditions, establishing the TCD model as a highly robust platform for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems: swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that these results stem from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</description>

      <title>Instanton theory and fluctuation corrections to the thermal nucleation rate of a ferromagnetic superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a field-theoretical description of thermal nucleation in a one-dimensional ferromagnetic superfluid, a quantum-gas analogue of false-vacuum decay. The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point of the energy functional -- the critical droplet or instanton -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations about this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial-value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for critical droplets close to the coexistence line, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size. Our results determine the parametric dependence of the nucleation rate and predict its signature in experimental images of a nucleating gas, increasing the rigor of comparisons between nucleation theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.</description>
