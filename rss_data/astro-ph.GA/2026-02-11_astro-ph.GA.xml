      <title>Multi-wavelength morphology and dust emission in low-redshift dwarf galaxies in COSMOS-Web with HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass or dwarf galaxies (M$_{\ast}&lt;10^{9}$ M${\odot}$) are abundant in the Universe, yet their formation and evolution remain poorly understood. Their enhanced sensitivity to feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) make them excellent laboratories to test whether feedback prescriptions in cosmological simulations accurately reproduce their interstellar medium (ISM) properties. We present JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of nine dwarf galaxies from COSMOS-Web survey at redshift $z&lt;0.08$, with star formation rates ranging from 0.003-0.3 M${\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of log M$_{\ast}\sim8-9$ M$_{\odot}$. The detection rate with both NIRCam and MIRI is 100\%, indicating that these dwarfs possess substantial ISM content. The detected sample includes a roughly equal mix of early-type and late-type dwarfs, suggesting that it is representative of the broader dwarf galaxy population in low-density environments. We find that the observed MIRI flux distributions are comparable to forward-modelled flux distributions of mass-matched simulated galaxies in TNG50. We further conduct a multi-wavelength morphological analysis complementing the JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging with archival HST/ACS data, employing the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, smoothness) framework. Among the multi-wavelength images, MIRI exhibits the largest variation in CAS parameters, likely due to dust lanes and clumps in several galaxies, also suggested by Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. This suggests that the dust content in these systems may be higher than those implied by rest-frame optical or near-infrared observations alone. Upcoming UV/optical and mid-infrared spectroscopic follow-up will be critical for constraining the gas kinematics and dust grain properties of dwarf galaxies in low-density environments such as COSMOS.</description>

      <title>All the Massive Galaxy Overdensities during Reionization: JWST Rest-Frame Optical Selection Reveals Young, Chemically Evolved Galaxies Embedded in Dense, Neutral Gas at z &gt; 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-redshift progenitors of present-day galaxy clusters are believed to substantially contribute to the global star-formation rate density and drive the large-scale reionization of the Universe. Here we present a blind and unbiased search for and characterization of galaxy overdensities during the reionization epoch at redshifts $z\sim 5.5-7$, based on rest-frame optical JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the Abell\,2744 lensing field as part of the JWST-ALT survey. Using a physically-motivated, cosmological inference Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we identify six galaxy overdensities, including five robust systems at $z=5.66$ to $6.77$. They are all characterized by total halo masses $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ inferred from a range of proxies. We find that the galaxy members in these overdense environments are on average less massive though equally metal-rich, and generally comprised of younger stellar populations as indicated from their bluer spectral slopes less prominent Balmer breaks, than field galaxies at similar redshifts. Further, we use this novel rest-frame optical selection of galaxy proto-clusters to infer the fraction and 3D distribution of strong Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) in the overdensity environments. We find that two out of six galaxy overdensities have excess \hi\ absorption compared to the field-average, while the other four are consistent within their large scatter in density. These results present the first direct observational constraints on the tomography of the dense, neutral gas reservoirs in large-scale galaxy overdensities at $z&gt;5$ and highlight the limitations of pre-JWST searches for reionization-era galaxy overdensities relying on the detection of strong LAEs alone.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>Downsizing does not extend to dwarf galaxies: identifying the stellar mass regimes shaped by supernova and AGN feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the fraction of red (quenched) galaxies varies in the dwarf galaxy regime (10^7 MSun &lt; Mstar &lt; 10^9.5 MSun), using a mass-complete sample of ~5900 dwarfs at z&lt;0.15, constructed using deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. The red fraction decreases steadily until Mstar ~ 10^8.5 MSun and then increases again towards lower stellar masses. This 'U' shape demonstrates that the traditional notion of 'downsizing' (i.e. that progressively lower mass galaxies maintain star formation until later epochs) is incorrect -- downsizing does not continue uninterrupted into the dwarf regime. The U shape persists regardless of environment, indicating that it is driven by internal processes rather than external environment-driven mechanisms. Our results suggest that, at Mstar &lt; 10^8 MSun, the quenching of star formation is dominated by supernova (SN) feedback and becomes more effective with decreasing stellar mass, as the potential well becomes shallower. At Mstar &gt; 10^9 MSun, the quenching is driven by a mix of SN feedback and AGN feedback (which becomes more effective with increasing stellar mass, as central black holes become more massive). The processes that quench star formation are least effective in the range 10^8 MSun &lt; Mstar &lt; 10^9 MSun, likely because the potential well is deep enough to weaken the impact of SN feedback, while the effect of AGN feedback is still insignificant. The cosmological simulations tested here do not match the details of how the red fraction varies as a function of stellar mass -- we propose that the red fraction vs stellar mass relation (particularly in the dwarf regime) is a powerful calibrator for the processes that regulate star formation in galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Feedback, Galaxy Quenching and Outflows at Cosmic Dawn: Analysis of the SEEDZ Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we analyse the growth and feedback effects of massive black holes (MBHs) in the SEEDZ simulations. The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\sim10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($\Lambda$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the mysteries of Jets in peculiar NLSy1 galaxies through multi-wavelength variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RQ-NLSy1s) are generally considered to be dominated by thermal emission from the accretion disk. However, recurring 37 GHz radio flares detected from seven RQ-NLSy1s by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory suggest that non-thermal processes may also contribute to their emission. We present a systematic optical and mid-infrared (MIR) variability study combined with broadband SED modeling to investigate the origin of their flux variations and assess the relative contributions of accretion disk and possible jet-related components. High-cadence optical light curves in the g, r, and i bands were obtained from ZTF, while long-term MIR light curves in the W1 and W2 bands were taken from WISE. Optical variability was quantified using the FAGN-test, peak-to-peak variability amplitude, and fractional variability, while MIR variability was characterized using redshift-corrected intrinsic variability amplitudes. Optical variability was examined from intra-night to long-term timescales, and MIR variability on long-term timescales. All RQ-NLSy1s show statistically significant long-term optical variability, with amplitudes increasing toward shorter wavelengths. Three sources exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends and increasing variability amplitudes across the optical bands, indicating a non-thermal contribution. Intrinsic MIR variability is detected in three of the four sources. Significant optical-MIR and MIR intra-band lags are observed, while optical intra-band lags are insignificant. Optical variability amplitudes are anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio and positively correlated with black hole mass. These results suggest that a subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to their optical and MIR emission, supported by SED modeling. Coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring is required to better constrain the origin of these variations.</description>

      <title>Probing Dust Composition in Distant Galaxies with JWST Mid-IR Spectroscopy of Quasars with Foreground 2175 A Absorbers I: Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar dust plays a crucial role in gas cooling and molecule formation, influencing galaxy evolution. However, the composition and structure of dust in distant galaxies are still poorly understood. We have started a JWST MIRI MRS program investigating the dust features in gas-rich and dusty galaxies at redshifts $z&lt;$1.2, with strong 2175~\AA\ bumps detected in absorption along the lines of sight to distant background quasars. Here we describe our program strategy, and present MIRI MRS observations of IR dust features at $z=0.5-1.2$ in five quasar spectra that form the first part of our full sample. We identify artifacts in MIRI MRS data that affect the background in IFU cubes, and propose methods to reduce their effects. We pay special attention to modeling the quasar mid-IR continuum, which shows significant variation depending on AGN morphology, redshift, and black hole mass. Dust in foreground galaxies produces significant absorption from the 10~$\mu$m silicate feature in all five quasar spectra. Compared with the average 10~$\mu$m silicate feature in the diffuse ISM of the Milky Way, we find differences in the absorption peak position, width of the features, and asymmetry of the profiles. A detailed study of these silicate features is presented in our next paper (Klimenko et al. 2026b). In two quasar spectra, we tentatively detect weak IR features near 3.0 and 3.4~$\mu$m. Their strengths are comparable to those seen in the Milky Way ISM, but follow-up observations are required to confirm these detections.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational Wave Background from Intermediate Mass Black Holes in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) formed in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are expected to inspiral into their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), generating a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background in the mHz--decihertz band. Using the population-agnostic energetic formalism, we treat the AGN-disk channel as a mass-flow pipeline connecting the stellar-mass black hole population observed by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) to the SMBH mass reservoir via IMBHs. By anchoring this estimate to the LVK merger rate densities and the cosmic SMBH mass density derived from scaling relations, we derive a limit on the background amplitude. We show that the total energy density of the background is bounded by the global mass budget of SMBH growth. For fiducial parameters consistent with the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4), this yields a characteristic strain $A_{\rm IMR} \simeq (1.2_{-0.2}^{+0.2})\times 10^{-21}$ at $3\,{\rm mHz}$. While this fiducial amplitude is subdominant to the Galactic white dwarf foreground and the stellar-mass Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) background, we show it can be distinguished by its non-Gaussian statistics and higher frequency cutoff. This new background may be detectable in the decihertz band where proposed detectors such as the Big Bang Observer or long-baseline lunar interferometers can measure it cleanly. A detection would provide a direct, model-independent constraint on the efficiency with which AGN disks process stellar remnants into SMBH mass growth, linking the LVK and LISA bands.</description>

      <title>Towards a general field equation for galaxies and galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MONDian theory of AQUAL (AQUAdratic Lagrangian) and the theory of GRAS (GRavitational Anti-Screening) are alternatives to the theory of dark matter. When these theories are applied to galaxy dynamics they are in excellent agreement with observations including the galactic RAR (Radial Acceleration Relationship). However, when applied to galaxy clusters they do not explain the bulk of the missing mass. This manuscript develops a modified version of the GRAS/AQUAL field equation that can be extended to galaxy clusters. It involves just a single free parameter. The new field equation is then applied to a sample of galaxy clusters and checked against modeled galaxies and solar system constraints. Further to this, the modified field equation leads to an understanding of the difference between the galactic RAR and the RAR recently found for clusters.</description>

      <title>ALMA [CI] Image of the Circumnuclear Disk of the Milky Way: Inflowing Low-density Molecular Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA [\ion{C}{1}]~$^3P_1$--$^3P_0$ imaging of the central $6.6\times4.2~\mathrm{pc}^2$ region of the Galaxy encompassing the circumnuclear disk (CND). The data reveal low-density ($n_\mathrm{H_2}\sim10^3~$cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas with inward motion, widespread both inside and outside the CND. The normalized [\ion{C}{1}] to CS~7--6 intensity difference decreases inwardly from $R=4$~pc to 1.7~pc and azimuthally along the CND's rotation, likely tracing paths of low-density gas inflow. By projecting spaxels into orbital coordinates assuming a velocity field model, we identify four kinematic features: a pair of spiral outer streamers toward the CND, inner streamers extending to 0.5~pc from Sgr~A$^*$, an outer disk at $ R\sim3$--6~pc, and the rotating ring at $R=2$~pc. $P$--$P$--$V$ correlation between the inner streamers and H42$\alpha$ indicates gas supply to the mini-spiral through the western arc (WA) and northern arm (NA). The total inflowing mass is $1.5\times10^4~M_\odot$, 1.7 times the mass of the rotating ring. The identified flows can be organized into two main pathways connecting the CND exterior and interior: ``WA flow'' feeding the mini-spiral WA via the CND, and ``NA flow'' bypassing the purely rotating orbit. The inflow rate along the former is approximately constant (0.1--0.16~$M_\odot~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), implying a CND dwelling time comparable to its orbital period and supporting the CND's transient nature. We also identify two [\ion{C}{1}]-bright clumps (CBCs) lacking dense-gas counterparts near the contact point between the northern outer streamer and the CND. Apparently intact against tidal disruption despite subcritical densities, the CBCs may represent a chemically young phase shortly after formation in colliding flows.</description>

      <title>Are carbon deflagration supernovae triggered by dark matter ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions between stellar remnants and dark matter in the Galactic bulge are frequent, and the kinetic energy of a primordial black hole incident on a white dwarf, if it is all thermalized, will raise the degenerate core's temperature, by at least a degree in the case of a lunar mass black hole. This is an underestimate in two ways: the specific heat is less than 3k/2 per particle, and the incoming object is accelerated by gravitational focusing. Detailed physical models have recently been made of this triggering event. Present observational data are equivocal as to whether the radial distribution of type Ia supernovae in galaxies follows the starlight in the galaxies, or is more concentrated towards the center, as collisional triggering would suggest. But future samples of millions of supernovae from the Rubin telescope will change that.</description>

      <title>Selecting Post-Starburst Galaxies Based on Star Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-StarBurst (PSB) galaxies are galaxies that have undergone a large burst of star formation followed by rapid quenching. Understanding their properties as a population can help us better understand how galaxies evolve to quiescence. This project aims to use Star Formation History (SFH) measurements from the Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys MaNGA, CALIFA, and AMUSING++ processed with the Pipe3D analysis pipeline in order to select PSB galaxies as well as PSB regions in galaxies. Most PSB selection methods use cutoffs determined by spectral features, but in this work we introduce a new PSB selection method based directly on the property we are most interested in; inferred SFHs. IFS data allows us to probe a galaxy's star formation on a spatially resolved scale, enabling us to examine the size, shape, and location of PSB regions within a galaxy. We select 107 PSB galaxies, only 7 of which are among known PSBs selected by other methods. Unlike traditional PSB selection methods, our approach is not biased against Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Despite this, we still find no evidence for a significant Seyfert 2 PSB population, suggesting that strong AGN activity is uncommon throughout the PSB phase. Our spatially-resolved SFH selection identifies a wide range of galaxies, including globally quiescent elliptical galaxies with centrally-concentrated PSB spaxels, galaxies with ring-like PSB spaxels and a preference for inside-out age gradients (contrary to what has previously been observed in the literature), and galaxies with widespread PSB regions that have significant star formation elsewhere in the galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Monopolar Jet from Protostar HOPS 10: Evidence for Asymmetric Magnetized Launching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in star formation is understanding how a protostar accretes mass from its circumstellar disk while removing excess angular momentum. Protostellar jets are widely invoked as the primary channels for angular momentum removal, yet the mechanism by which they are launched and extract angular momentum remains poorly constrained. Here we report high-resolution ALMA Band 7 (345 GHz) and Band 6 (230 GHz) observations of CO (3-2), CO (2-1), and SiO (5-4) emission from the protostar HOPS 10 (G209.55-19.68S2). The combined data trace both the entrained outflow and the collimated jet with excellent spatial and velocity resolution, revealing a uniquely monopolar protostellar jet, the clearest example reported to date. The system exhibits a distinctly unipolar high-velocity jet with velocity offsets of +44 to +66 km s-1, unlike the predominantly bipolar morphology characteristic of most protostellar jets. While the low-velocity outflow, with velocity offsets of -20 to +30 km s-1, is detected in both directions, the high-velocity jet appears only on one side, and this monopolarity is consistent across all tracers. Given the nearly edge-on geometry and low submillimeter extinction, comparable emission would normally be expected from both lobes. The shock tracer SiO emission confirms a genuine, highly collimated jet rather than cloud contamination, and no ambient structure is capable of obscuring a counterjet. We argue that intrinsically asymmetric mass loading along the disk magnetic field lines provides the most plausible explanation for the observed monopolarity.</description>

      <title>A deep MeerKAT view of associated HI absorption in radio AGNs at intermediate redshift: Role of absorber geometry and conditions of the gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MeerKAT observations searching for HI absorption in a sample of 17 powerful ($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}&gt; 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) radio sources at intermediate redshifts ($0.25&lt;z&lt;0.7$). The sample is well characterised at radio and optical wavelengths, allowing us to connect the presence (or absence) of HI to the properties of the AGN and its host galaxy. The sample consists mostly of core-dominated sources and quasars. Half of the targets have a UV luminosity $L_{\rm UV} = 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, above this limit, the gas would be expected to be ionised by this radiation. We obtained 15 spectra free (or almost free) of radio frequency interference, reaching extremely low optical depths ($\tau_{\rm peak} &lt; 0.005$) resulting in three new HI absorption detections. Two are associated HI absorptions, giving a detection rate of such systems of $13\%\pm 7\%$. Both are found in young radio sources (PKS 1151-34 and PKS 1306-09), confirming the trend that this type of sources are more often detected in HI compared to more evolved ones. The UV luminosity of both these sources is below $10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. Surprisingly, one of the detections (PKS 1151-34) is hosted by a quasar, suggesting that the radio lobes are still embedded in the circumnuclear disc. In the second source (PKS 1306-09), the HI is highly blueshifted and likely part of a jet-driven outflow. A third detection is a 'local intervening' system, caused by a galaxy in the local environment of PKS 0405-12 and located in front of the southern radio lobe of this source, about 100 kpc in projection from this quasar. Overall, the results indicate a variety of plausible situations, which resemble what is seen at low redshifts. For the associated absorption, a combination of evolutionary status of the radio sources, physical conditions, and geometry of the gas structure determine the detection rate of HI absorption.</description>

      <title>Herschel/HIFI Observations of Molecular Lines Toward G10.47+0.03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral line analysis of the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment.</description>

      <title>Organic Acid Chemistry in ISM: Detection of Formic Acid and its Prebiotic Chemistry in Hot Core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the interstellar medium, formic acid (HCOOH) plays a significant role in the synthesis of the simplest amino acid, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH). The presence of HCOOH suggests that oxygen-bearing molecules may be directly involved in the chemical and physical evolution of star formation regions, particularly in hot molecular cores. This paper presents the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the $trans$-conformer of HCOOH toward the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, located in the massive star formation region G358.93$-$0.03. This study employed high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 7. The column density and excitation temperature of $t$-HCOOH are determined as $(8.13\pm0.72)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $120\pm15$ K, respectively. The fractional abundance of $t$-HCOOH relative to H$_{2}$ is $(2.62\pm 0.29)\times 10^{-9}$. The column density ratios of $t$-HCOOH/CH$_{3}$OH and $t$-HCOOH/H$_{2}$CO are $(1.56 \pm 0.12)\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.16 \pm 0.12)$, respectively. We computed a three-phase warm-up chemical model of HCOOH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. We found that the observed and modelled abundances of HCOOH are almost identical, within a factor of 0.89. Based on chemical modelling, we showed that HCOOH may be formed through the reaction between HCO and OH on the grain surface, which is further released in the gas-phase.</description>

      <title>EMU Radio Observations of Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5938 (Araish) to investigate the origin of its radio emission, specifically the contribution from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation. Using Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) data, we detect extended radio emission extending outwards to the galactic axis, with a steep non-thermal spectral index ($\alpha = -1.2 \pm 0.2$) indicative of synchrotron radiation from an AGN jet. The jet has a physical extent of $\approx 8.2\,kpc$ (angular length of $64^{\prime\prime}$). Multi-wavelength data from The Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey 2 (DECaPS2), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) provide further support for this interpretation. The colour-colour diagram presenting WISE infrared observations suggests the presence of dust and young stars that trace the galaxy's disk structure. Our analysis reveals a radio jet, alongside star formation traced by infrared emission, demonstrating the complex interplay of AGN activity and star formation in this well-resolved galaxy. Intriguingly, the spatial relationship reveals the brighter X-ray emission to be largely adjacent to and enveloping the extended radio emission. This suggests that the radio jet, while extending at a significant angle to the galactic disk, is confined by the larger X-ray gas halo, similar to other systems (i.e., ESO 295-IG022, Centaurus A) and may indicate jet collimation and channelling effects.</description>

      <title>Global statistical entropy and its implications for the main sequences of stars and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a dissipative system such as star or a galaxy, the emitted photons are decoupled from matter particles and may therefore be considered as part of a closed system to which the Second Law of Thermodynamics applies. In the present paper, we define a global entropy using a statistical approach that accounts for the contributions of both matter particles and photons. The statistical contribution of radiation is described as a photon gas in the definition of this global entropy. The increase in global entropy can foster structure formation -- rather than disorder -- because structures such as stars and galaxies are efficient at dissipating energy in the form of photons, and thus at producing entropy. We show that stars generate a nearly equal amount of specific entropy, and therefore a comparable number of photons per unit mass, over their lifetime on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. This suggests that the main sequence of the HR diagram constitutes a locus of convergence toward a universal specific entropy production by stars. We then examine the implications of this approach for the star-formation main sequence in galaxies, and find a similar result. The emergence of organized structures in cosmic history reflects the second law, as organized matter is efficient at generating entropy through the slicing of energy into lower-frequency photons. This is also reflected in the dominant contribution of low-frequency photons to the extragalactic background light. Finally, we briefly discuss how this perspective may inform us on the possibility of the existence of life elsewhere in the universe.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional metallicity distribution of the ionized gas in NGC 628 and NGC 6946</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here two H II region catalogues with azimuthal resolution for the two grand design galaxies NGC 628 and NGC 6946. With the help of these catalogues, we study several properties of the star-forming processes occurring in spiral galaxies. We obtained direct imaging in the narrow-band filters centred at H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, [O II]{\lambda}3727, and [O III]{\lambda}{\lambda}4959, 5007 and their respective continua. After the calibration and correction of the data, we obtained for each H II region the de-reddened fluxes in the aforementioned lines, the size, the H{\alpha} equivalent width, and, using two different empirical calibrations, the metallicity. Employing a method based on the Delaunay triangulation, a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the metallicity was obtained. Data for 209 H II regions of NGC 628 and 226 H II regions of NGC 6946 are obtained. The radial behaviours of the H{\alpha} equivalent width, the excitation, and the oxygen abundance are derived. Two-dimensional representations of the metallicity and the excitation are calculated for the galaxies in the study. The two empirical calibrations of the metallicity are compared. The oxygen abundance gradients obtained in this study agree with previously published values. However, more regions were examined than in previous studies. We find a difference of about 0.6 dex between the two empirical calibrations employed. Finally, the 2D representations of the metallicity reveal high metallicity knots in NGC 628, and for NGC 6946 a high metallicity azimuthal structure is discovered. These high metallicity regions seem to be linked to the arms of the galaxies and are probably produced by an increase in the temperature of the ionizing clusters in the H II regions, which may be linked to variations in the initial mass functions of the galaxies between the arm and interarm regions.</description>

      <title>Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters -- VII. Comparisons with gravitational-wave events until LVK-O4a and Gaia compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatories suggest multiple formation channels for GW compact binary mergers. Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\odot\leq M_{cl}(0)\leq10^5M_\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\leq3.0\times10^4M_\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]</description>

      <title>Massive disk galaxies with high surface brightness plus low surface brightness stellar disks, hosted by massive dark matter halo -- a TNG50 simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study massive disk galaxies (total stellar mass$&gt;=10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) from IllustrisTNG50 simulation, and perform 2-D structural decomposition of the galaxies using their idealised, synthetic SDSS images for z=0. We find an interesting sample of galaxies having a central high surface brightness (HSB) stellar disk, surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) stellar disk, similar to giant LSB galaxies. These massive, double-exponential disk galaxies are found to be hosted by dark matter haloes of $\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in agreement to observations of such galaxies. Their maximum rotation velocity, an approximate measure of their dynamical mass, lies within $\sim$ (300-500) km/s. The stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio and the baryon-to-dark matter mass ratio of the sample lies in the range of $\sim$ (0.04 - 0.46) and $\sim$ (0.07 - 0.47) respectively. Our results show that cosmological simulations are able to form disc galaxies with HSB plus LSB disks, as in observations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Galactic cirrus filaments in HSC-SSP high-resolution deep images using artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of Galactic optical cirrus poses a challenge for observing faint objects within our Galaxy and dim extragalactic structures. To investigate individual cirrus filaments in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program public data release 3 (HSC-SSP DR3) we use a technique based on convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning. This approach allows us to distinguish cirrus filaments from foreground and background objects across the entire HSC-SSP, using optical images in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ wavebands. A comparison with previous work using deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe~82 (SDSS Stripe~82) data reveals that the cirrus clouds identified in this study are highly consistent in location within the overlapping survey region. However, in the deeper HSC-SSP dataset, we were able to detect $4.5$ times more cirrus clouds. Our study indicates that the sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images is over-subtracted, as evidenced by the surface brightness distribution in cirrus filaments and surrounding regions. Objects with surface brightness of $m = 29~\mbox{mag~arcsec}^{-2}$ near large filaments can be dimmed by over-subtraction of $0.5$ magnitude in the $r$ band. This suggests that cirrus clouds should be taken into account in algorithms for estimating the sky background. For practical use, we provide a catalog of filaments and a framework that allows one to train neural network models for segmenting cirri in HSC-SSP coadd images.</description>

      <title>Resolved Dust Emission and CO Isotopologues in Giant Molecular Clouds of the Andromeda Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust emission at submillimeter wavelengths can be used to reliably trace the basic properties of molecular clouds. Early results from a recent Submillimeter Array (SMA) survey of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) include the first detections of resolved dust continuum emission from individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in an external spiral galaxy. This paper updates on the now-complete SMA survey of 80 Herschel-identified giant molecular associations (GMAs) in M31. The SMA survey simultaneously probes dust continuum emission at 230 GHz and the $J = 2 \rightarrow 1$ transitions of the CO isotopologues, $^{12}\rm CO$, $^{13}\rm CO$, and $\rm C^{18}O$ at a spatial resolution of $\lesssim 15~\mathrm{pc}$. Dust continuum emission was detected in 71 cloud cores, of which 26 were resolved. This more than doubles the size of the previous sample. By comparing dust and CO observations with identical astrometry, we directly measure the dust mass to-light ratios, $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{^{12}CO}$, and $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{^{13}CO}$. We derive $&lt;\alpha^{\prime}_{\rm ^{12}\rm CO}&gt;~=~0.070~\pm~0.031~M_{\odot}\,(\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ and $&lt;\alpha^{\prime}_{\rm ^{13}\rm CO}&gt;~=~0.37~\pm~0.20~M_{\odot}\,(\rm K~km~s^{-1}~pc^{2})^{-1}$ for the increased sample, which are in agreement with previously reported values. From virial analysis, we find that 80% of the GMC regions traced by resolved dust emission are bound and close to virial equilibrium. Finally, we update our analysis on the metallicity dependence of $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{\rm CO}$ by combining SMA observations with existing MMT/Hectospec optical spectroscopy toward H II regions. We find no trend in $\rm \alpha^{\prime}_{\rm CO}$ with metallicity, supporting the previous findings.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of circumnuclear ionising clusters. IV. NGC 1097</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumnuclear star-forming ring of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1097 provides a unique laboratory to study star formation under extreme conditions. This work aims to derive the physical properties of the circumnuclear star-forming regions (CNSFRs) using MUSE integral field spectroscopy observations. A total of 24 individual ionised HII are identified and analysed within its ring, which spans from $\sim$385 pc to $\sim$1.3 kpc. Despite the complex nuclear activity, all HII regions are found to be purely photoionised. Directly derived abundances reveal supersolar metallicities, with the highest one exceeding five times the solar value (12+log(S/H) = 7.875 $\pm$ 0.353, T$_e$([SIII]) = 3912 $\pm$ 567 K), and representing the highest abundance reported to date. In this high-metallicity regime, we find a break in the ionisation parameter-[SII]/[SIII] relation, which can be explained by changes in the ionisation structure and line emissivities, as confirmed by photoionisation models that successfully reproduce the observed emission-line ratios. Our results also indicate that the local gas supply regulates the star formation activity within the ring, with the young stars ionising 8 % of the total gas in the ring. Furthermore, our findings support a propagating starburst scenario, originating in the galaxy nucleus and extending towards the ends of the bar and into the circumnuclear ring through bar-driven shocks, this being consistent with the results of previous multi-wavelength studies. Finally, we likely detect optical signatures associated with one of the two known jets in this galaxy. This finding, together with the radio core emission previously found at sub-parsec scales, reflects the presence of feedback processes operating even on small galactic disc scales.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): Helix Nebula public data, Data Analysis Pipeline data products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) using data from the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM), by applying the recently developed LVM Data Analysis Pipeline (LVM-DAP). Covering the full optical range (3600-9800 {\AA}) over a contiguous ~ 0.5 degree field, the LVM data provide the first hexagonally sampled, wide-field emission-line maps of all major ionic species in this archetypal planetary nebula. The resulting flux, kinematic, and line-ratio maps reveal the well-known ionization stratification of the nebula, from the compact He++ core to the bright [O III] ring and the extended low-ionization envelope, enabling a detailed comparison with classical aperture spectroscopy. Owing to the sensitivity and uniform spatial sampling of the LVM, numerous faint auroral and diagnostic lines are detected across the nebula, including [O III] 4363, [N II] 5755, and He I lines, allowing precise measurements of weak-line morphology. The derived radial trends confirm the remarkably low dust content and the overall homogeneity of electron temperature and density across the main ring. Ionized-gas kinematics traced by H{\alpha} further support the scenario of a slowly expanding, limb-brightened shell consistent with previous studies. This work demonstrates the diagnostic power of LVM spectroscopy for extended nebulae and highlights its capability to recover both global and spatially resolved physical conditions across complex ionized structures.</description>

      <title>Effects of Numerical Resolution on Simulated Cloud-Wind Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing by hydrodynamical instabilities plays a key role in cloud-wind interactions, causing cloud destruction in the adiabatic limit and facilitating cloud survival with efficient radiative cooling. However, the rate of mixing in numerical simulations is sensitive to the smallest resolved scale, and the relationship between resolution and cloud evolution is under-explored. Using a set of cloud-crushing simulations, we investigate the effects of numerical resolution on cloud survival and acceleration. Modeling both adiabatic and radiative cases, in a subsonic and supersonic wind, we find that cloud survival and velocity does depend on the numerical resolution, however, no single resolution requirement can be applied to all scenarios. In the radiative subsonic case, we find that mass growth and acceleration appear converged at only 4 cells per cloud radius. Conversely, in the supersonic regime, we see a clear dependence of cloud destruction and velocity on resolution that is not converged even at 48 cells per cloud radius, implying that accurately capturing cloud destruction may require higher resolution than capturing growth. We also present a simple model illustrating how ram pressure accelerates cool clouds at early times before mixing kicks in as an acceleration mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A from 2013--2020 Deep [Fe II]+[Si I] Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A based on two deep, narrow-band images covering the [Fe II] 1.644um + [Si I] 1.645um lines obtained in 2013 and 2020 with the same instruments on the UKIRT 3.8m telescope. The identical setup and observing procedure allow for direct, accurate measurements of morphological and kinematic changes over a seven-year baseline. We identified 263 compact knots in the 2020 image and, through comparison with the 2013 catalog of Koo et al. 2018 (arXiv:1809.07935), classified them into quasi-stationary circumstellar knots and fast-moving knots (FMKs) of supernova ejecta. The FMKs show significant flux fluctuations, and many of those detected in 2013 are absent in the 2020 image. Proper-motion measurements derived from cross-correlation analysis indicate that most FMKs follow nearly ballistic expansion, whereas some, particularly those just beyond the eastern Fe-rich, X-ray emitting ejecta region, exhibit noticeable deceleration. The proper motions of the main ejecta shell were also measured and modeled as a uniformly expanding shell with a systemic motion, which reproduces the observed geometric and kinematic asymmetries of the remnant.</description>

      <title>Transient Relativistic Iron Emission Line from an X-ray Flaring Supermassive Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the first transient relativistic iron K{\alpha} line in an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1047+5907. The line was detected 21.5 days (rest-frame) after an X-ray coronal flare observed in 2008 and it exhibits significant broadening consistent with relativistic reflection from the accretion disk in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The line has a width of ~300 eV, corresponding to a Keplerian velocity of 14,000 km s-1, at a distance of 5-41 light-days from the SMBH, strongly implying that the observed coronal flare triggered the emergence of the line. This event provides rare direct evidence of the response of the accretion disk to impulsive coronal illumination and offers a new method to probe the SMBH and disk physics. The relativistic modeling favors a broadened line produced by distant reflection from an accretion disk around a rapidly spinning black hole viewed at an intermediate inclination, consistent with other observations. Systematic monitoring of type 1 AGN following strong X-ray flares may open a new observational window into the innermost regions of AGN, enabling constraints on the physics of SMBH and its accretion disk at different radii that are otherwise challenging to access.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Nested Structure of the Outflow from the Low Luminosity Protostar IRAS 16253-2429 using JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the earliest stage of star and planet formation requires detailed observations to address the connection and interplay between the accretion, outflow, and disk evolution. We present results from observations of the low luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{bol}} \sim 0.2,L_{\odot}$) and low mass ($M_{*} \sim 0.15,M_{\odot}$) Class 0 protostar IRAS~16253$-$2429, conducted as part of the eDisk ALMA Large Program and the JWST Cycle~1 GO program IPA. Observations reveal a wide hourglass-shaped continuum cavity traced in scattered light (at $\leq 5,\mu$m), with a brighter, extended northern side. We detect 15 pure rotational H$2$ transitions ($E{\mathrm{up}} = 1015$--21411~K), revealing a wide-angle molecular outflow. The outflow width traced by H$_2$~0-0~S(11) at the protostellar location measures $\leq 35$~au, slightly larger than the dust and Keplerian disk diameters ($\sim 30$~au) but wider than the 20--23~au jet width in [Fe~II]. The opening angle narrows from 40--35 degrees for the low-$J$ H$_2$ lines (up to S(5)) and the cold gas component traced by ALMA $^{12}$CO to $\sim 28$--19 degrees for the high-$J$ H$_2$ lines (S(7)--S(11)). Position--velocity diagrams of H$2$ reveal higher velocities for higher $E{\mathrm{up}}$, ranging from $\sim 12.5$~km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(1) and S(2) to $\sim 28.5$~km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(5) and S(7) with respect to the mean flow velocity. The nested excitation and velocity structure of the collimated jet and wide-angle wind suggests a magnetohydrodynamic wind as a likely launching mechanism, similar to findings in other protostars and Class~II sources. The lower-velocity millimeter CO emission may be gas from the infalling envelope accelerated outward by the wide-angle wind along the cavity walls.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae. IV. Type Ia supernovae: Na I D line strength relating to external material and intrinsic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear runaways in certain white dwarfs in binary systems. They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations.</description>

      <title>The temperature and metallicity distributions of the ICM: insights with TNG-Cluster for XRISM-like observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new era of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy will significantly improve our understanding of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by providing precise constraints on its underlying physical properties. However, spectral fitting requires reasonable assumptions on the thermal and chemical distributions of the gas. We use the output of TNG-Cluster, the newest addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, to provide theoretical expectations for the multi-phase nature of the ICM across hundreds of z=$ clusters (M$_{500c} = 10^{14.0-15.3}~M_\odot$) based upon a realistic model for galaxy formation and evolution. We create and analyse, in an observer-like manner, end-to-end XRISM/Resolve mock observations towards cluster centres. We then systematically compare the intrinsic temperature and Fe abundance of the simulated gas with the inferred ones from spectral fitting via a variety of commonly used spectral-emission models. Our analysis suggests that models with a distribution of temperatures, better describe the broad thermal distributions of the ICM, as predicted by TNG-Cluster, but still incur biases in the inferred temperature of 0.5-2 keV (16th-84th percentiles). However, all spectral-emission models systematically underestimate the Fe abundance of the central ICM by 0.12 Solar (22 per cent), almost an order of magnitude higher than the abundance errors reported in the literature, primarily due to projection effects. Selecting only strong cool core clusters leads to minor improvements on inference quality, removing the majority of outliers but maintaining similar overall biases and cluster-to-cluster scatter.</description>

      <title>Circumgalactic medium of quasar host galaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 probed by strong Mg II absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a sample of 166 projected quasar pairs we investigate the influence of active galactic nuclei on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the quasar host galaxies probed using strong Mg II absorption (i.e., $W_{2796}\ge 1\dot{A}$) at impact parameters ($D$) $&lt;$100 kpc. The foreground quasars are restricted to the redshift range $0.4 \leq z \leq 0.8$ and have median bolometric luminosity and stellar mass of $10^{45.1} erg~s^{-1}$and $10^{10.89} M_\odot$ respectively. We report detections of Mg II absorption in 29 cases towards the background quasar and in 4 cases along the line of sight to the foreground quasars. We do not find any difference in the distribution of $W_{2796}$ and covering fraction ($f_c$) as a function of $D$ between quasar host galaxies and control sample of normal galaxies. These results are different from what has been reported in the literature, possibly because: (i) our sample is restricted to a narrow redshift range, (ii) comparative analysis is carried out after matching the galaxy parameters, (iii) we focus mainly on strong Mg II absorption and (iv) our sample lacks foreground quasars with high bolometric luminosity (i.e., $L_{bol}&gt;10^{45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Future studies probing luminous foreground quasars, preferably at lower impact parameters and higher equivalent width sensitivity is needed to consolidate our findings.</description>

Abstract: We explore the consequences of a novel but increasingly well-supported hypothesis that supermassive black holes may have formed from primordial black holes form ed prior to, and rapidly growing in, the radiation-dominated universe. We show that this hypothesis can predict the luminosity of quasars and their luminosity distribution. With reasonable values of the parameters introduced, these predictions are borne out by observations. The model predicts density evolution in accordance with observations. If the same galaxy interaction rate creates quasars and radio galaxies, whose primordial black hole nuclei seem somewhat less massive, their relative number densities reflect relative lifetimes in these states.</description>

      <title>Interpreting nebular emission lines in the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable outcomes from \textit{JWST} has been the exquisite UV-optical spectroscopic data for galaxies in the high-redshift Universe ($z \geq 5$), enabling the use of various nebular emission lines to infer conditions of the interstellar medium. In this work, we assess the reliability of commonly used diagnostics for estimating the star formation rate (SFR), the ionising photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$), and the gas-phase oxygen abundance, focusing on dust corrections based on A$_{\rm V}$ (V-band attenuation) and the Balmer decrement. Using forward-modelled galaxy spectra from idealised toy models and the FLARES cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we examine how variations in stellar populations and star-dust geometry affect these diagnostics. We find that the clumpy nature of \flares\ galaxies lead to strong internal variation in age, metallicity and dust attenuation, biasing the inferred quantities. In FLARES the SFRD at the bright-end of the SFR function can be underestimated by as much as $30\%$ compared to the true values. While the intrinsic $\xi_{\rm ion}$ in FLARES is nearly constant with stellar mass, estimates derived from H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ can be underestimated by more than 0.5 dex at high stellar masses ($&gt;10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$), introducing an artificial declining trend. Similarly, the dust-corrected mass-metallicity relation inferred from line ratios is significantly flatter than the intrinsic mass-weighted relation. These systematic offsets arise from the coupling between heterogeneous stellar populations and non-uniform star-dust geometry and depend on the diagnostic and the dust-correction method employed. No single dust-correction approach yields unbiased estimates of all quantities simultaneously, highlighting the need for forward modelling and comparisons in observed space for robust high-redshift inference.</description>

      <title>YOLO-CIANNA: Galaxy detection with deep learning in radio data: II. Winning the SKA SDC2 using a generalized 3D-YOLO network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the scientific exploitation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) approaches, there is a need for new advanced data analysis and visualization tools capable of processing large high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.</description>

      <title>Non-explosive pre-supernova feedback in the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation and testing of a subgrid non-explosive pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation. The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young, massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range $10^4-10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Substructures with Free-Form Modelling: A Case Study of the `Jackpot' Strong Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterising the population and internal structure of sub-galactic halos is critical for constraining the nature of dark matter. These halos can be detected near galaxies that act as strong gravitational lenses with extended arcs, as they perturb the shapes of the arcs. However, this method is subject to false-positive detections and systematic uncertainties, particularly degeneracies between an individual halo and larger-scale asymmetries in the distribution of lens mass. We present a new free-form lens modelling code, developed within the framework of the open-source software \texttt{PyAutoLens}, to address these challenges. Our method models mass perturbations that cannot be captured by parametric models as pixelized potential corrections and suppresses unphysical solutions via a Mat\'ern regularisation scheme that is inspired by Gaussian process regression. This approach enables the recovery of diverse mass perturbations, including subhalos, line-of-sight halos, external shear, and multipole components that represent the complex angular mass distribution of the lens galaxy, such as boxiness/diskiness. Additionally, our fully Bayesian framework objectively infers hyperparameters associated with the regularisation of pixelized sources and potential corrections, eliminating the need for manual fine-tuning. By applying our code to the well-known `Jackpot' lens system, SLACS0946+1006, we robustly detect a highly concentrated subhalo that challenges the standard cold dark matter model. This study represents the first attempt to independently reveal the mass distribution of a subhalo using a fully free-form approach.</description>

      <title>Kiloparsec-scale turbulence driven by reionization may grow intergalactic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM) underwent intense heating that resulted in pressure disequilibrium in the wake of ionization fronts during cosmic reionization. The dynamical relaxation to restore pressure balance may have driven small-scale turbulence and, hence, the amplification of intergalactic magnetic fields. We investigate this possibility for the first time using a suite of $\approx 100$ pc resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of IGM gas dynamics. We show that as the spatial resolution improves beyond that achieved with most prior studies, much of the IGM becomes turbulent unless it was pre-heated to $\gg 100~$K before reionization. In our most turbulent simulations, we find that the gas energy spectrum follows the expected $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov scaling to the simulation's resolution, and the eddy turnover time of the turbulence is $&lt; 1$ Gyr at $k \approx 1 ~$kpc$^{-1}$. Turbulence will grow magnetic fields, and we show that the fields grown by reionization-driven turbulence could explain lower limits on the strength of volume-filling B-fields from observations of TeV blazars. As reionization sweeps over the cosmos, this mechanism could create turbulence throughout the cosmic volume with a character that only depends on the amount of IGM preheating.</description>

      <title>The NHIM bifurcation scenario of a particle in an asymmetric binary system of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation scenario of a three-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system, a model based on the Lagrange restricted 3-body problem: a test particle moving in the gravitational field of a pair of interacting dwarf galaxies. The phase space of this system has 3 fundamental normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) and their invariant stable and unstable manifolds form homoclinic/heteroclinic tangles. As the perturbation parameter increases, the NHIMs begin to lose normal hyperbolicity and their constituent KAM tori break, creating transient chaotic dynamics around them. We also observe a certain kind of coordination between the bifurcation scenarios of these NHIMs. We analyse this phenomenon using Poincar\'e maps and the delay time function.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a precision measurement of radio sky brightness over 60-350 MHz. Accurate knowledge of the radio sky over these frequencies is essential for modelling foregrounds in experiments targeting cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization. Measurements below 1 GHz are also needed to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, constrain nanojansky radio source populations and dark matter models, understand origins of the diffuse radio background, and improve calibration of long-wavelength radio telescopes. Here we show that current all-sky maps and the 2016 Global Sky Model (GSM2016) require substantial corrections over 60-350 MHz. GSM2016 has an offset exceeding 100 K below 100 MHz and must be scaled up by a factor increasing from 1.2 below 200 MHz to 1.5 at 350 MHz. This significantly increases previously inferred excess radio background, motivating review of faint source populations and dark-matter decay models. Our measurement used a new receiver architecture that self-calibrates its noise contribution and bandpass in situ while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, log-periodic SKALA4.1 antenna on a 40 m diameter SKA-Low station ground mesh. Sky models scaled to our measurements can set the absolute flux-density scale for SKA-Low and other low-frequency radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Galactic magnetic fields seeded by ultralight dark photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that ultralight dark photons, which couple to the Standard Model photon through kinetic mixing, can potentially source galactic scale magnetic fields. Although these magnetic fields would be too weak to detect at present in galaxies due to plasma screening effects, we show that dark photons can provide the seed magnetic field strength ($10^{-20}$ G) required for dynamo amplification in galaxies. Such dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are consistent with observations of $\mu$G strength galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Sight II: Characterizing the luminous companion to Kappa Velorum with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kappa Velorum (Markeb, HD 81188) is one of the brightest stars in the Southern sky and has long been known to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The binary mass function is large, $f(M)=1.15\ M_\odot$, suggesting that the bright (V=2.5) B2IV star may host a dark, compact object companion. We use VLTI GRAVITY observations to definitively test this possibility by directly resolving the binary. We detect a main sequence B star companion and rule out the compact object scenario. By combining the relative astrometric orbit and archival radial velocities, we report an updated precise characterization of the orbit (period $P=116.795\pm0.002$ d, eccentricity $e=0.1764\pm0.0004$, inclination $i=74.04\pm0.01^{\circ}$) and estimate the masses of the B stars. Using the original Hipparcos parallax measurement $\varpi = 6.05\pm0.48$ mas, we find $M_1 = 10^{+4}_{-2}\ M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 6.9\pm1.0\ M_\odot$. The uncertainties on the masses are primarily driven by the uncertain parallax, which we find is likely biased by the orbital motion. We use an archival UVES spectrum and MIST evolutionary tracks to refine our mass estimates. Finally, we discuss how interferometry and high-contrast imaging may be used to characterize other candidate star+compact object binaries, including those that will be discovered with Gaia DR4, as part of a larger effort to uncover the hidden population of black holes in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The Binary Fraction of Stars in the Dwarf Galaxy Ursa Minor via Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize multi-epoch line-of-sight velocity measurements from the Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to estimate the binary fraction for member stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Our dataset comprises 670 distinct member stars, with a total of more than 2,000 observations collected over approximately one year. We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy &amp; Mayor (1991) and Moe &amp; Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]&gt;-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]&lt;-2.14) population. Based on the Moe &amp; Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field spreading from stellar and galactic dynamos into the exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we explain why the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere radius expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. Dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large-scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes.</description>
