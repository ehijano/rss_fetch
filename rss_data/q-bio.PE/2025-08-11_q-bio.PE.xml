      <title>Identifiability of Large Phylogenetic Mixtures for Many Phylogenetic Model Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifiability of phylogenetic models is a necessary condition to ensure that the model parameters can be uniquely determined from data. Mixture models are phylogenetic models where the probability distributions in the model are convex combinations of distributions in simpler phylogenetic models. Mixture models are used to model heterogeneity in the substitution process in DNA sequences. While many basic phylogenetic models are known to be identifiable, mixture models in generality have only been shown to be identifiable in certain cases. We expand the main theorem of [Rhodes, Sullivant 2012] to prove identifiability of mixture models in equivariant phylogenetic models, specifically the Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter model, Kimura 3-parameter model and the Strand Symmetric model.</description>

      <title>Optimal trap cropping investments to maximize agricultural yield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trap cropping is a pest management strategy where a grower plants an attractive "trap crop" alongside the primary crop to divert pests away from it. We propose a simple framework for optimizing the proportion of a grower's field or greenhouse allocated to a main crop and a trap crop to maximize agricultural yield. We implement this framework using a model of pest movement governed by trap crop attractiveness, the potential yield threatened by pests, and functional relationships between yield loss and pest density drawn from the literature. Focusing on a simple case in which pests move freely across the field and are attracted to traps solely by their relative attractiveness, we find that allocating 5-20 percent of the landscape to trap plants is typically required to maximize yield and achieve effective pest control in the absence of pesticides. For highly attractive trap plants, growers can devote less space because they are more effective; less attractive plants are ineffective even in large numbers. Intermediate attractiveness warrants the greatest investment in trap cropping. Our framework offers a transparent and tractable approach for exploring trade-offs in pest management and can be extended to incorporate more complex pest behaviors, crop spatial configurations, and economic considerations.</description>

      <title>The GFB Tree and Tree Imbalance Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree balance plays an important role in various research areas in phylogenetics and computer science. Typically, it is measured with the help of a balance index or imbalance index. There are more than 25 such indices available, recently surveyed in a book by Fischer et al. They are used to rank rooted binary trees on a scale from the most balanced to the least balanced. We show that a wide range of subtree-size based measures satisfying concavity and monotonicity conditions are minimized by the complete or greedy-from-the-bottom (GFB) tree and maximized by the caterpillar tree, yielding an infinitely large family of distinct new imbalance indices. Answering an open question from the literature, we show that one such established measure, the $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic, has the GFB tree as its unique minimizer. We also provide an alternative characterization of GFB trees, showing that they are equivalent to complete trees, which arise in different contexts. We give asymptotic bounds on the expected $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic under the uniform and Yule-Harding distributions of trees, and answer questions for the related $Q$-shape statistic as well.</description>

      <title>Stability of difference equations with interspecific density dependence, competition, and maturation delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general system of difference equations is presented for multispecies communities with density dependent population growth and delayed maturity. Interspecific competition, mutualism, predation, commensalism, and amensalism are accommodated. A sufficient condition for the local asymptotic stability of a coexistence equilibrium in this system is then proven. Using this system, the generalisation of the Beverton-Holt and Leslie-Gower models of competition to multispecies systems with possible maturation delays is presented and shown to yield interesting stability properties. The stability of coexistence depends on the relative abundances of the species at the unique interior equilibrium. A sufficient condition for local stability is derived that only requires intraspecific competition to outweigh interspecific competition. The condition does not depend on maturation delays. The derived stability properties are used to develop a novel estimation approach for the coefficients of interspecific competition. This approach finds an optimal configuration given two conjectures. First, coexisting species strive to outcompete competitors. Second, persisting species are more likely in stable systems with strong dampening of perturbations and high ecological resilience. The optimal solution is compared to estimates of niche overlap using an empirical example of malaria mosquito vectors with delayed maturity in the Anopheles gambiae sensu lato species complex.</description>

      <title>Self-Balancing of Cell Populations via Martingale Turnover with Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive control in biological systems, such as intestinal immunity, remains poorly understood despite detailed knowledge of underlying networks. We propose an alternative regulatory framework based on stochastic martingale turnover, where cells proliferate through mutual competition and decay without cell-type-specific regulation. Through stochastic simulations and mathematical analyses, we show that this process autonomously achieves balanced population states characterized by low decay probabilities. The dynamics are governed by a modified Langevin equation, in which conserved mass is replaced by a composition-dependent fitness variable. A random walk with step lengths that shorten near a target, together with its mathematical solution, demonstrates autonomous convergence of composition, due to the large number of possible microstates. These results suggest a biologically plausible, generic mechanism for adaptability.</description>
