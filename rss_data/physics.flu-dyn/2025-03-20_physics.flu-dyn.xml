      <title>Sequential learning based PINNs to overcome temporal domain complexities in unsteady flow past flapping wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a data-driven and physics combined modelling of unsteady flow systems with moving immersed boundaries, Sundar {\it et al.} introduced an immersed boundary-aware (IBA) framework, combining Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the immersed boundary method (IBM). This approach was beneficial because it avoided case-specific transformations to a body-attached reference frame. Building on this, we now address the challenges of long time integration in velocity reconstruction and pressure recovery by extending this IBA framework with sequential learning strategies. Key difficulties for PINNs in long time integration include temporal sparsity, long temporal domains and rich spectral content. To tackle these, a moving boundary-enabled PINN is developed, proposing two sequential learning strategies: - a time marching with gradual increase in time domain size, however, this approach struggles with error accumulation over long time domains; and - a time decomposition which divides the temporal domain into smaller segments, combined with transfer learning it effectively reduces error propagation and computational complexity. The key findings for modelling of incompressible unsteady flows past a flapping airfoil include: - for quasi-periodic flows, the time decomposition approach with preferential spatio-temporal sampling improves accuracy and efficiency for pressure recovery and aerodynamic load reconstruction, and, - for long time domains, decomposing it into smaller temporal segments and employing multiple sub-networks, simplifies the problem ensuring stability and reduced network sizes. This study highlights the limitations of traditional PINNs for long time integration of flow-structure interaction problems and demonstrates the benefits of decomposition-based strategies for addressing error accumulation, computational cost, and complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Chip Evacuation in Ejector Deep Hole Drilling using Mesh-Free Simulation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ejector deep hole drilling is advantageous due to its high material removal rate and bore quality without requiring a complex sealing system for drilling applications with large length to diameter ratios. Sufficient supply of metal working fluid and efficient removal of the swarf is crucial, which would otherwise lead to poor bore quality, increased friction, and tool wear. Based on experimentally obtained chip shapes, a coupled SPH-DEM simulation model was used to enhance the understanding of the highly complicated and dynamic chip evacuation conditions. A comparison of different tool head designs and their influence on the chip evacuation is presented.</description>

      <title>Multiphase SPH for surface tension: resolving zero-surface-energy modes and achieving high Reynolds number simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a Riemann-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework for the stable and accurate simulation of surface tension in multiphase flows, with density and viscosity ratios as high as 1000 and 100, respectively. The methodology begins with the computation of surface stress, from which surface tension is derived, ensuring the conservation of momentum. For the first time, this study identifies the root cause of particle disorder at fluid-fluid interfaces, attributed to a numerical instability defined herein as \textit{zero-surface-energy modes}. To address this, we propose a novel penalty force method, which eliminates zero-surface-energy modes and significantly enhances the overall stability of the simulation. Importantly, the penalty force correction term is designed to maintain momentum conservation. The stability and accuracy of the proposed framework are validated through several benchmark cases with analytical solutions, performed under both two-dimensional and three-dimensional conditions. Furthermore, the robustness of the method is demonstrated in a three-dimensional high-velocity droplet impact scenario, achieving stable performance at high Reynolds numbers ($Re=10000$) and Weber numbers ($We=25000$). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful demonstration of a mesh-free method achieving stable multiphase flow simulations under such extreme $Re$ and $We$ conditions. A qualitative comparison with previous experimental results is also conducted, confirming the reliability of the simulation outcomes. An open-source code is provided for further in-depth study.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Interactions in Particle Suspensions: A Perspective on Stokesian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stokesian Dynamics (SD) is a numerical framework used for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particle suspensions at low Reynolds number. It combines far-field approximations with near-field lubrication corrections, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This work reviews SD and provides a perspective on future directions for this approach. We outline the mathematical foundations, the method's strengths and weaknesses, and the computational challenges that need to be overcome to work with SD effectively. We also discuss recent advancements that improve the algorithm's efficiency, including the use of iterative solvers and matrix-free approaches. In addition, we highlight the limitations of making stronger, albeit more cost-effective approximations to studying hydrodynamic interactions in dense suspensions than made in SD, such as the two-body Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) approximation. To overcome these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that replaces SD's full many-body computations with a neural network trained on SD data. That is, we correct the RPY approximation, while avoiding costly matrix inversions. We demonstrate the potential of this method on a simple system, where we find a close match to SD data while algorithmically outperforming RPY. Our work provides an outlook on the way in which large-scale simulations of particle suspensions can be performed in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Modeling late-time sensitivity to initial conditions in Boussinesq Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article sheds light on the late-time influence of initial conditions in Boussinesq Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence using an approach combining direct numerical simulations, machine learning and theory. The initial conditions are characterized by four non-dimensional numbers describing the statistical properties of random-phase multi-mode perturbations of an initial diffuse interface. Based on high-fidelity data, a surrogate physics-informed neural network is used to extrapolate the dynamics to very late times and unseen initial conditions, beyond the reach of simulations. This enables uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses to be carried out, revealing the influence of initial conditions in the late-time regime. While the results support the idea of a universal self-similar growth rate, the virtual time origin is found to be strongly sensitive to the initial Reynolds, perturbation steepness and bandwidth numbers. An analytical model based on the phenomenology of Rayleigh-Taylor mixing layers explains most of this dependency, and provide accurate predictions for the virtual time origin. It turns out that when the initial perturbation reaches nonlinear saturation earlier, the mixing layer also re-accelerates earlier, while the virtual time origin is larger.</description>

      <title>Surface quasigeostrophic turbulence: The refined study of an active scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SQG describes the 2D active transport of a scalar field, such as temperature, which -- when properly rescaled -- shares the same physical dimension of length/time as the advecting velocity field. This duality has motivated analogies with 3D turbulence. In particular, the Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor similarity theory predicts a Kolmogorov-type inertial range scaling $\propto (\varepsilon \ell)^{1/3}$ for both scalar and velocity fields, and the presence of intermittency was pointed out by Sukhatme &amp; Pierrehumbert ($Chaos$ $\boldsymbol{12}$, 439, 2002) in unforced settings. In this work, we refine these analogies using simulations up to $16,384^2$ collocation points in a steady-state regime dominated by the direct cascade of scalar variance. We show that mixed structure functions, linking velocity increments with powers of scalar differences, exhibit clear scaling, revealing the role of anomalous fluxes of all the scalar moments. However, the usual (unmixed) structure functions do no follow any power-law scaling in any range of scales, neither for the velocity nor for the scalar increments. This specific form of the intermittency phenomenon reflects the specific kinematic properties of SQG turbulence, involving the interplay between long-range interactions, structures and geometry. Revealing the multiscaling in single-field statistics requires to resort to generalised notions of scale invariance, such as extended self-similarity and specific form of refined self-similarity. Our findings emphasise the fundamental entanglement of scalar and velocity fields in SQG turbulence: They evolve hand in hand and any attempt to isolate them destroys scaling in its usual sense. This perspective sheds new lights on the discrepancies in spectra and structure functions, that have been repeatedly observed in SQG numerics for the past 20 years.</description>

      <title>New exact spatially localized solutions of the (3 + 1) -dimensional nonlinear non-dissipative quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation for an exponential atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New exact spatially localized stationary solutions against the background of a zonal flow are found for the (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear non-dissipative quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation, which describes Rossby waves and vortices in an exponential atmosphere. In total, three solutions are presented. The nonlinear boundary conditions with a flat bottom and a rigid lid generate an infinite discrete set of baroclinic modes for each solution. The solutions show the possibility of existence of baroclinic dipoles in the exponential atmosphere, similar to baroclinic dipoles in the ocean. It is shown that: a) a pair of vortices in the baroclinic dipole appears and disappears when the velocity of stationary motion changes; b) the baroclinic dipoles show the ability to transfer warm or cold air depending on the polarity of the vortices in the dipole.</description>

      <title>NeuralFoil: An Airfoil Aerodynamics Analysis Tool Using Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NeuralFoil is an open-source Python-based tool for rapid aerodynamics analysis of airfoils, similar in purpose to XFoil. Speedups ranging from 8x to 1,000x over XFoil are demonstrated, after controlling for equivalent accuracy. NeuralFoil computes both global and local quantities (lift, drag, velocity distribution, etc.) over a broad input space, including: an 18-dimensional space of airfoil shapes, possibly including control deflections; a 360 degree range of angles of attack; Reynolds numbers from $10^2$ to $10^{10}$; subsonic flows up to the transonic drag rise; and with varying turbulence parameters. Results match those of XFoil closely: the mean relative error of drag is 0.37% on simple cases, and remains as low as 2.0% on a test dataset with numerous post-stall and transitional cases. NeuralFoil facilitates gradient-based design optimization, due to its $C^\infty$-continuous solutions, automatic-differentiation-compatibility, and bounded computational cost without non-convergence issues.
  NeuralFoil is a hybrid of physics-informed machine learning techniques and analytical models. Here, physics information includes symmetries that are structurally embedded into the model architecture, feature engineering using domain knowledge, and guaranteed extrapolation to known limit cases. This work also introduces a new approach for surrogate model uncertainty quantification that enables robust design optimization.
  This work discusses the methodology and performance of NeuralFoil with several case studies, including a practical airfoil design optimization study including both aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic constraints. Here, NeuralFoil optimization is able to produce airfoils nearly identical in performance and shape to expert-designed airfoils within seconds; these computationally-optimized airfoils provide a useful starting point for further expert refinement.</description>

      <title>Spectral Transfers of Sign-Definite Invariants in Wave Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spectral transfers of sign-definite invariants in general wave turbulence systems equipped with a wave kinetic equation. We develop a formalism to investigate and to characterize these transfers, based on the ability to track the exchanges within individual interactions by the detailed-conservation properties of the resonant interactions. We consider the three-wave, four-wave, five-wave and six-wave kinetic equations, introducing measures of locality of general wave turbulence system and of median step size in wave-wave scattering. We then use the proposed method to study the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak one-dimensional model and examine the characteristics of energy and action transport. We show that energy in the direct energy cascade is dominated by local interactions, but shows a nonlocal inverse "return flow" that counters the direction of the cascade. The inverse action cascade is instead ruled by more nonlocal interactions, but shows a highly local direct "return flow". We also show that for both cascades a scale separation of over an order of magnitude is necessary to ensure a negligible interaction rate with forcing or dissipation regions, hinting at why in numerical simulations of the model an extremely large box size is necessary in order to realize the theoretical Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Transient CFD through Machine Learning-Based Flow Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for many industrial applications, but a significant portion of their computational cost stems from the time needed to reach statistical steadiness from initial conditions. We present a novel machine learning-based initialization method that reduces the cost of this subsequent transient solve substantially, achieving a 50% reduction in time-to-convergence compared to traditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Through a case study in automotive aerodynamics using a 16.7M-cell unsteady RANS simulation, we evaluate three ML-based initialization strategies. Two of these strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a physics-informed hybrid method combining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) a more versatile approach integrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD solvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally expensive steady RANS initializations, while requiring only seconds of computation. We develop a robust statistical convergence metric based on windowed time-averaging for performance comparison between initialization strategies. Notably, these improvements are achieved using an ML model trained on a different dataset of automotive geometries, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. The proposed methods integrate seamlessly with existing CFD workflows without requiring modifications to the underlying flow solver, providing a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations through improved ML-based initialization strategies.</description>

      <title>Elastic displacements and viscous hydrodynamic flows in wedge-shaped geometries featuring a straight edge: Green's functions for forces oriented parallel to the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For homogeneous and isotropic linearly elastic solids and for incompressible fluids under low-Reynolds-number conditions the fundamental solutions of the associated continuum equations were derived a long time ago for bulk systems. That is, the corresponding Green's functions are available in infinitely extended systems, where boundaries do not play any role. However, introducing boundaries renders the situation significantly more complex. Here, we derive the corresponding Green's functions for a linearly elastic homogeneous and isotropic material in a wedge-shaped geometry. Two flat boundaries confine the material and meet at a straight edge. No-slip and free-slip conditions are considered. The force is oriented in a direction parallel to the straight edge of the wedge. Assuming incompressibility, our expressions also apply to the situation of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamic viscous fluid flows. Thus, they may be used, for instance, to describe the motion of self-propelled objects guided by an edge or the distortion of soft elastic actuators in wedge-shaped environments of operation.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer and mixing in initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition analyzed by in-situ gas composition sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of iCVD kinetics often make assumptions about the iCVD vapor phase that have been challenging to validate experimentally. We address this gap by investigating heat transfer and mixing in the iCVD reactor using in-situ gas composition sensing. Our work allows practitioners of iCVD to estimate the degree of mixing and temperature profile in the vapor phase based on reactor dimensions and process variables such as chamber pressure. We begin by using dimensional analysis to simplify the parameter space governing heat transfer and mixing, identifying key dimensionless groups that capture the dominant physics. We find that the degree of mixing in the reactor is primarily determined by the Peclet number (Pe), and heat transfer is primarily determined by the Knudsen number (Kn). Multiphysics simulations of the iCVD reactor provide visualizations of non-ideal mixing and allow us to identify the critical Pe above which the well-mixed assumption may begin to break down. To verify that the well-mixed assumption applies to iCVD at low Pe, we measured the residence time distribution (RTD) for argon and isopropanol flowing at 1 sccm, finding a close match to the well-mixed model. We used a Pirani pressure gauge for composition sensing to measure the RTD. We demonstrate the Pirani gauge to be a precise gas composition sensor, which is more modular and less expensive than methods like in-situ infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We then address heat transfer by measuring thermal diffusion from the filament at a range of pressures in argon and isopropanol. We quantified the effects of non-ideal heat transfer at low pressures and identified a critical Kn, above which heat transfer is independent of pressure. Measurement of thermally driven pressure changes in batch mode enables us to define and model an "effective temperature" for the reactor, matching the thermal diffusion model.</description>

      <title>An improved aerodynamic model for quasi-steady simulations of animal flight at moderate Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on experimental and numerical studies aimed at developing an improved paradigm to model animal flight at moderate Reynolds numbers ($ 20 k - 50k $). A series of experiments were performed to characterize the behaviors of aerodynamic forces and moment associated with a quasi-steady rectangular wing over a range of angle of attack, $\alpha$. We demonstrate that, while the drag coefficient curve, $C_D(\alpha)$, can be accurately modeled solely by a simple trigonometric function, the evolution of lift coefficient curve, $C_L(\alpha)$, is governed by the sum of trigonometric and exponential functions, where the latter captures the linear variation in lift coefficient within the small-angle regime, as predicted by the linear inviscid theory. In addition, we establish an empirical relation between the location of the center of pressure and $\alpha$, which can be used in conjunction with the proposed aerodynamic formulas (i.e., $C_L$ and $C_D$) to evaluate the pitching moment coefficient, $C_M(\alpha)$, about any arbitrary axis. These quasi-steady formulations are then utilized within a previously tested flapping-wing code to simulate the forward flight of a pigeon and a bat at various flight speeds, and the results are compared against previously reported experimental data. We successfully demonstrate that the proposed formulas yield much better agreement with wingbeat frequency for both animals, especially at higher flight speeds. In addition, the small-angle regime proves critical in offering higher $C_L/C_D$, leading to solutions with lower power consumption and body pitching variation, both of which are important aspects in designing future flapping wing robots.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, despite being an idealization of real flows, is of fundamental interest as a model of the spontaneous emergence of order from chaotic flows. The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved. Here, we experimentally study turbulence in periodically driven nanofluidic channels with a high aspect ratio using superfluid helium. We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.</description>

      <title>Exploring external rarefied gas flows through the method of fundamental solutions</title>

Abstract: The well-known Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations of fluid dynamics are, in general, not adequate for describing rarefied gas flows. Moreover, while the Stokes equations -- a simplified version of the Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations -- are effective in modeling slow and steady liquid flow past a sphere, they fail to yield a non-trivial solution to the problem of slow and steady liquid flow past an infinitely long cylinder (a two-dimensional problem essentially); this is referred to as Stokes' paradox. The paradox also arises when studying these problems for gases. In this paper, we present a way to obtain meaningful solutions for two-dimensional flows of rarefied gases around objects by circumventing Stokes' paradox. To this end, we adopt an extended hydrodynamic model, referred to as the CCR model, consisting of the balance equations for the mass, momentum and energy and closed with the coupled constitutive relations. We determine an analytic solution of the CCR model for the problem and compare it with a numerical solution based on the method of fundamental solutions. Apart from addressing flow past a circular cylinder, we aim to showcase the capabilities of the method of fundamental solutions to predict the flow past other objects in two dimensions for which analytic solutions do not exist or are difficult to determine. For that, we investigate the problem of rarefied gas flow past an infinitely long semicircular cylinder.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for fully coupled stochastic fluid dynamics across scales</title>

Abstract: This work investigates variational frameworks for modeling stochastic dynamics in incompressible fluids, focusing on large-scale fluid behavior alongside small-scale stochastic processes. The authors aim to develop a coupled system of equations that captures both scales, using a variational principle formulated with Lagrangians defined on the full flow, and incorporating stochastic transport constraints. The approach smooths the noise term along time, leading to stochastic dynamics as a regularization parameter approaches zero. Initially, fixed noise terms are considered, resulting in a generalized stochastic Euler equation, which becomes problematic as the regularization parameter diminishes. The study then examines connections with existing stochastic frameworks and proposes a new variational principle that couples noise dynamics with large-scale fluid motion. This comprehensive framework provides a stochastic representation of large-scale dynamics while accounting for fine-scale components. Our main result is that the evolution of the small-scale velocity component is governed by a linearized Euler equation with random coefficients, influenced by large-scale transport, stretching, and pressure forcing.</description>

      <title>Traveling spatially localized convective structures in an inclined porous medium</title>

Abstract: Multiple stationary, localized structures were recently found for inclined porous medium convection with constant-temperature boundaries. We analyze traveling asymmetric, localized convective structures, consisting of 1 to 5 pulses, in a 2D inclined porous layer with fixed temperature at the bottom and an imperfectly conducting boundary at the top, such that midplane reflection symmetry is broken. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed with different Biot numbers at the top boundary. The drift velocity $c$ of pulses is measured for different values of the symmetry parameter $\kappa\geq0$ based on the Biot number, with perfect midplane reflection symmetry and $c=0$ at $\kappa=0$. In small domains, the drift velocity $c&gt;0$ (upslope), increases monotonically with $\kappa$, while in large domains $c$ changes sign depending on parameters. We show that pulse tails, controlling interactions, depend on the dominant spatial eigenvalues, whose real part is closest to zero, with a transition at $\kappa_c&gt;0$: below $\kappa_c$, both dominant eigenvalues are complex, and the tails are oscillatory. Above $\kappa_c$, the dominant spatial eigenvalue with a positive real part becomes real, and the downslope tail transitions from oscillatory to monotonic. Below $\kappa_c$, bound states with different numbers of pulses exist whose collisions are studied. Well above $\kappa_c$, adjacent pulses repel each other, spreading out and becoming equispaced in the domain. A reduced model is proposed based on the interaction via tails of adjacent pulses, reproducing the repulsion and collisions from DNS. The model shows that the transition from bound states to equidistant spreading occurs when the monotonic/oscillatory tails have the same slope. This study elucidates the motion of localized patterns in moderate-Rayleigh number convection in an inclined porous layer with an imperfectly conducting boundary.</description>

      <title>Rods in flows: the PDE theory of immersed elastic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of curve evolution equations approximating the motion of a Kirchhoff rod immersed in a low Reynolds number fluid. The rod is modeled as a framed curve whose energy consists of the bending energy of the curve and the twisting energy of the frame. The equations we consider may be realized as gradient flows of the rod energy under a certain anisotropic metric coming from resistive force theory. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a comprehensive treatment of the PDE theory of immersed rod dynamics. We begin by analyzing the problem without the frame, in which case the evolution is globally well-posed and solutions asymptotically converge to Euler elasticae. Next, in the planar setting, we demonstrate the existence of large time-periodic solutions forced by intrinsic curvature relevant to undulatory swimming. Finally, the majority of the paper is devoted to the evolution of an immersed Kirchhoff rod in 3D, which involves a strong coupling between the curve and frame. Under a physically reasonable assumption on the curvature, solutions exist globally-in-time and asymptotically converge to rod equilibria.</description>
