      <title>An entropy for Boolean independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to define a Boolean entropy notion parallel to the framework of free entropy proposed by Voiculescu. Motivated by the work of Lenczewski and the work of C\'ebron &amp; Gillers, we mainly investigated two random matrix models (the Gaussian Symmetric Block model and the Conditioned GUE model), in which asymptotic Boolean independence appears. We showed a large deviation principle for both models. As a result, the two rate functions coincide up to scaling and are minimized by the Rademacher distribution. Therefore, we refer to the logarithmic integral in the rate function as Boolean entropy. Finally, we proved this logarithmic integral is maximized by the Rademacher distribution and monotone along the Boolean Central Limit Theorem.</description>

      <title>Laws of Large Numbers for Information Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laws of large numbers establish asymptotic guarantees for recovering features of a probability distribution using independent samples. We introduce a framework for proving analogous results for recovery of the $\sigma$-field of a probability space, interpreted as information resolution--the granularity of measurable events given by comparison to our samples. Our main results show that, under iid sampling, the Borel $\sigma$-field in $\mathbb R^d$ and in more general metric spaces can be recovered in the strongest possible mode of convergence. We also derive finite-sample $L^1$ bounds for uniform convergence of $\sigma$-fields on $[0,1]^d$.
  We illustrate the use of our framework with two applications: constructing randomized solutions to the Skorokhod embedding problem, and analyzing the loss of variants of random forests for regression.</description>

      <title>Extreme value theory for geometric Brownian motion and pricing of short maturity barrier options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the limiting distribution of geometric Brownian motion conditional on its running maximum taking large values. We show that the conditional distribution of the geometric Brownian motion converges after a suitable normalization to a deterministic exponential curve. We obtain quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence. Analogous results are shown for the Brownian motion, which converges to a straight line. As an application of our results to financial mathematics, we obtain closed form asymptotic formulae for the fair price of barrier options with general path dependent payoff in the short maturity limit, with quantitative error estimates. We provide exact formulae for European, Asian and lookback style payoffs.</description>

      <title>LDP for the covariance process in fully connected neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study large deviation properties of the covariance process in fully connected Gaussian deep neural networks. More precisely, we establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for the covariance process in a functional framework, viewing it as a process in the space of continuous functions. As key applications of our main results, we obtain posterior LDPs under Gaussian likelihood in both the infinite-width and mean-field regimes. The proof is based on an LDP for the covariance process as a Markov process valued in the space of non-negative, symmetric trace-class operators equipped with the trace norm.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for elephant random walks remembering the recent past, with applications to the Takagi-van der Waerden class functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Takagi-van der Waerden functions $f_r(x)$, a well-known class of continuous but nowhere differentiable functions, from probabilistic point of view. As an application of elephant random walks remembering the recent past (ERWRP, a.k.a. symmetric correlated random walks), we obtain precise estimates for the oscillations of $f_r(x)$. We also establish a result on the necessary and sufficient condition for localization of the ERWRP with variable step length, which can be applied to obtain a complete description of the differentiability properties of the Takagi-van der Waerden class functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the concentration properties of quadratic forms associated with Markov chains using the martingale decomposition method introduced by Atchad\'e and Cattaneo (2014). In particular, we derive concentration inequalities for the overlapped batch mean (OBM) estimators of the asymptotic variance for uniformly geometrically ergodic Markov chains. Our main result provides an explicit control of the $p$-th moment of the difference between the OBM estimator and the asymptotic variance of the Markov chain with explicit dependence upon $p$ and mixing time of the underlying Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the derivative-free global optimization algorithm Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), establishing uniform-in-time propagation of chaos as well as an almost uniform-in-time stability result for the microscopic particle system. The proof of these results is based on a novel stability estimate for the weighted mean and on a quantitative concentration inequality for the microscopic particle system around the empirical mean. Our propagation of chaos result recovers the classical Monte Carlo rate, with a prefactor that depends explicitly on the parameters of the problem. Notably, in the case of CBO with anisotropic noise, this prefactor is independent of the problem dimension.</description>

      <title>On the wave turbulence theory of 2D gravity waves, II: propagation of randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second part of our work initiating the rigorous study of wave turbulence for water waves equations. We combine energy estimates, normal forms, and probabilistic and combinatorial arguments to complete the construction of long-time solutions with random initial data for the 2d (1d interface) gravity water waves system on large tori.
  This is the first long-time regularity result for solutions of water waves systems with large energy (but small local energy), which is the correct setup for applications to wave turbulence. Such a result is only possible in the presence of randomness.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based supervised learning of generative models for efficient sampling of multimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid generative model for efficient sampling of high-dimensional, multimodal probability distributions for Bayesian inference. Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings and Langevin Monte Carlo sampling methods, are effective for sampling from single-mode distributions in high-dimensional spaces. However, these methods struggle to produce samples with the correct proportions for each mode in multimodal distributions, especially for distributions with well separated modes. To address the challenges posed by multimodality, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy. We start by minimizing the energy function with initial guesses uniformly distributed within the prior domain to identify all the modes of the energy function. Then, we train a classifier to segment the domain corresponding to each mode. After the domain decomposition, we train a diffusion-model-assisted generative model for each identified mode within its support. Once each mode is characterized, we employ bridge sampling to estimate the normalizing constant, allowing us to directly adjust the ratios between the modes. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively handle multimodal distributions with varying mode shapes in up to 100 dimensions. An application to Bayesian inverse problem for partial differential equations is also provided.</description>

      <title>Channel Fingerprint Construction for Massive MIMO: A Deep Conditional Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is essential for future mobile communication networks. Channel fingerprint (CF), also referred to as channel knowledge map, is a key enabler for intelligent environment-aware communication and can facilitate CSI acquisition. However, due to the cost limitations of practical sensing nodes and test vehicles, the resulting CF is typically coarse-grained, making it insufficient for wireless transceiver design. In this work, we introduce the concept of CF twins and design a conditional generative diffusion model (CGDM) with strong implicit prior learning capabilities as the computational core of the CF twin to establish the connection between coarse- and fine-grained CFs. Specifically, we employ a variational inference technique to derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the log-marginal distribution of the observed fine-grained CF conditioned on the coarse-grained CF, enabling the CGDM to learn the complicated distribution of the target data. During the denoising neural network optimization, the coarse-grained CF is introduced as side information to accurately guide the conditioned generation of the CGDM. To make the proposed CGDM lightweight, we further leverage the additivity of network layers and introduce a one-shot pruning approach along with a multi-objective knowledge distillation technique. Experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reconstruction performance compared to the baselines. Additionally, zero-shot testing on reconstruction tasks with different magnification factors further demonstrates the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of community detection in noisy stochastic block models. We focus on two types of noise: (1) geometric noise where a latent-space kernel affects edge formation, and (2) Erdos-Renyi model censoring where edges are masked independently. We present a new algorithm DuoSpec that de-noises the network to a pristine stochastic block model structure for better community recovery. We demonstrate on synthetic data that our algorithm outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy models. We test our algorithm on the Amazon metadata dataset and demonstrate strong results on community detection.</description>

      <title>Efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates with Markovian surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08254v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are powerful mathematical models that integrate the biological details of neural systems, but their complexity often makes them computationally expensive and analytically untractable. The firing rate of an SNN is a crucial first-order statistic to characterize network activity. However, estimating firing rates analytically from even simplified SNN models is challenging due to 1) the intricate dependence between the nonlinear network dynamics and parameters, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. In this Letter, we propose a class of computationally efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates. This is based on a hierarchy of Markovian approximations that reduces the complexity of SNN dynamics. We show that while considering firing rates alone is insufficient for accurate estimations of themselves, the information of spiking synchrony dramatically improves the estimator's accuracy. This approach provides a practical tool for brain modelers, directly mapping biological parameters to firing rate.</description>

Abstract: We construct generalized regular representations of the wreath product of a compact group with the infinite symmetric group. The characters of these representations are determined by probability measures on families of partitions called the $z$-measures for the wreath product of a compact group with the symmetric group in the present paper. Our main result is an explicit formula for these $z$-measures which holds true for an arbitrary compact group. The result enables us to describe the spectral measures of the generalized regular representations of big wreath products.</description>

Abstract: We aim to study nonnegative, global solutions to a general class of nonlocal parabolic equations with bounded measurable coefficients. First, we prove a Widder-type theorem. Such a result has previously been studied only for certain translation invariant operators, and new ideas are needed in our general setting. Second, we establish sharp two-sided bounds for the fundamental solution via purely variational techniques, entirely bypassing tools from semigroup theory, Dirichlet forms, and stochastic analysis. Third, we derive sharp Harnack-type estimates that are novel even for the fractional heat equation.</description>

      <title>An Existence Result for a Stochastic Stefan Problem With Mushy Region and Turbulent Transport Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the proof of the existence of a martingale solution for a complex version of the stochastic Stefan problem. This particular formulation incorporates two important features: a mushy region and turbulent transport within the liquid phase. While our approach bears similarities to porous media equations, it differs in a crucial aspect. Instead of using the typical framework for such equations, we have chosen to work within an L2 space. This choice is motivated by the nature of the operator that characterizes the turbulent noise in our model. The L2 space provides a more natural and appropriate setting for handling this specific operator, allowing us to better capture and analyze the turbulent transport phenomena in the liquid phase of the Stefan problem.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Wave Propagation for a System of Branching Rank-Based Interacting Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study a branching particle system of diffusion processes on the real line interacting through their rank in the system. Namely, each particle follows an independent Brownian motion, but only K $\ge$ 1 particles on the far right are allowed to branch with constant rate, whilst the remaining particles have an additional positive drift of intensity $\chi$ &gt; 0. This is the so called Go or Grow hypothesis, which serves as an elementary hypothesis to model cells in a capillary tube moving upwards a chemical gradient. Despite the discontinuous character of the coefficients for the movement of particles and their demographic events, we first obtain the limit behavior of the population as K $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ by weighting the individuals by 1/K. Then, on the microscopic level when K is fixed, we investigate numerically the speed of propagation of the particles and recover a threshold behavior according to the parameter $\chi$ consistent with the already known behavior of the limit. Finally, by studying numerically the ancestral lineages we categorize the traveling fronts as pushed or pulled according to the critical parameter $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Rough Bergomi turns grey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a tractable extension of the rough Bergomi model, replacing the fractional Brownian motion with a generalised grey Brownian motion, which we show to be reminiscent of models with stochastic volatility of volatility. This extension breaks away from the log-Normal assumption of rough Bergomi, thereby making it a viable suggestion for the Equity Holy Grail -- the joint SPX/VIX options calibration. For this new (class of) model(s), we provide semi-closed and asymptotic formulae for SPX and VIX options and show numerically its potential advantages as well as calibration results.</description>

      <title>The number of cultural traits, evolving genealogies, and the descendant process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Moran-type model of cultural evolution, which describes how traits emerge, are transmitted, and get lost in populations. Our analysis focuses on the underlying cultural genealogies; they were first described by Aguilar (2015) and are closely related to the ancestral selection graph of population genetics, wherefore we call them ancestral learning graphs. We investigate their dynamical behaviour, that is, we are concerned with evolving genealogies. In particular, we consider the total length of the genealogy of a sample of individuals from a stationary population as a function of the (forward) time at which the sample is taken. This quantity shows a sawtooth-like dynamics with linear increase interrupted by collapses to near-zero at random times. We relate this to the metastable behaviour of the stochastic logistic model, which describes the evolution of the number of ancestors, or equivalently, the number of descendants of a given sample.
  We assume that new inventions appear independently in every individual, and all traits of the cultural parent are transmitted to the learner in any given learning event. The set of traits of an individual then agrees with the set of innovations along its genealogy. The properties of the genealogy thus translate into the properties of the trait set of a sample. In particular, the moments of the number of traits are obtained from the moments of the total length of the genealogy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the stochastic optimal control problem for the interacting particle system. We obtain the stochastic maximum principle of the optimal control system by introducing a generalized backward stochastic differential equation with interaction. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of this type of equation is proved. We derive the necessary condition that the optimal control should satisfy. As an application, the linear quadratic case is investigated to illustrate the main results.</description>

      <title>On the block size spectrum of a class of exchangeable dynamic random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the dynamic $\Theta$-random graph and the associated $\Theta$-coalescent with momentum. Dynamic $\Theta$-random graphs are a subclass of exchangeable and consistent random graph processes, parametrised by a measure $\Theta$ on $[0,1]\times (0,1]$, inspired by the classic $\Lambda$-coalescent from mathematical population genetics. The $\Theta$-coalescent with momentum accounts for the small connected components of this graph; in contrast to the underlying random graph it is exchangeable but not consistent. Our main results specialise on the case where $\Theta$ is the product of a beta measure and a Dirac mass at $1$. We prove a dynamic law of large numbers for the block size spectrum, which tracks the numbers of blocks containing $1,...,d$ elements. On top of that, we provide a functional limit theorem for the fluctuations. The limit process satisfies a stochastic differential equation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.</description>

      <title>Genus expansion for non-linear random matrix ensembles with applications to neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08459v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to studying certain non-linear random matrix ensembles and associated random neural networks at initialization. This begins with a novel series expansion for neural networks which generalizes Fa\'a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. The role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs, whose edges correspond to random matrices. Crucially, this expansion linearizes the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle and the genus expansion technique. As an application, we prove several results about neural networks with random weights. We first give a new proof of the fact that they converge to Gaussian processes as their width tends to infinity. Secondly, we quantify the rate of convergence of the Neural Tangent Kernel to its deterministic limit in Frobenius norm. Finally, we compute the moments of the limiting spectral distribution of the Jacobian (only the first two of which were previously known), expressing them as sums over non-crossing partitions. All of these results are then generalised to the case of neural networks with sparse and non-Gaussian weights, under moment assumptions.</description>

      <title>Critical percolation on slabs with random columnar disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10927v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a bond percolation model on slabs $\mathbb{S}^+_k=\mathbb{Z}_+\times \mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$ featuring one-dimensional inhomogeneities. In this context, a vertical column on the slab comprises the set of vertical edges projecting to the same vertex on $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\{0,\dots,k\}$. Columns are chosen based on the arrivals of a renewal process, where the tail distributions of inter-arrival times follow a power law with exponent $\phi&gt;1$. Inhomogeneities are introduced as follows: vertical edges on selected columns are open (closed) with probability $q$ (respectively $1-q$), independently. Conversely, vertical edges within unselected columns and all horizontal edges are open (closed) with probability $p$ (respectively $1-p$). We prove that for all sufficiently large $\phi$ (depending solely on $k$), the following assertion holds: if $q&gt;p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$, then $p$ can be taken strictly smaller than $p_c(\mathbb{S}^+_k)$ in a manner that percolation still occurs.</description>

      <title>On the Lyapunov exponent for the random field Ising transfer matrix, in the critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the top Lyapunov exponent of a product of random $2 \times 2$ matrices appearing in the analysis of several statistical mechanical models with disorder, extending a previous treatment of the critical case (Giacomin and Greenblatt, ALEA 19 (2022), 701-728) by significantly weakening the assumptions on the disorder distribution. The argument we give completely revisits and improves the previous proof. As a key novelty we build a probability that is close to the Furstenberg probability, i.e. the invariant probability of the Markov chain corresponding to the evolution of the direction of a vector in ${\mathbb R}^2$ under the action of the random matrices, in terms of the ladder times of a centered random walk which is directly related to the random matrix sequence. We then show that sharp estimates on the ladder times (renewal) process lead to a sharp control on the probability measure we build and, in turn, to the control of its distance from the Furstenberg probability.</description>

      <title>Relaxation equations with stretched non-local operators: renewal and time-changed processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study renewal processes defined by means of extensions of the standard relaxation equation through ``stretched" non-local operators (of order $\alpha$ and with parameter $\gamma$). In a first case we obtain a generalization of the fractional Poisson process, which displays either infinite or finite expected waiting times between arrivals, depending on the parameter $\gamma$. Therefore, the introduction in the operator of the non-homogeneous term driven by $\gamma$ permits us to regulate the transition between different regimes of our renewal process. We then consider a second-order relaxation-type equation involving the same operator, under different sets of conditions on the constants involved; for a particular choice of these constants, we prove that the corresponding renewal process is linked to the first one by convex combination of its distributions. We discuss also alternative models related to the same equations and their time-change representation, in terms of the inverse of a non-decreasing process which generalizes the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy subordinator.</description>

Abstract: The random current representation has been very successful in analyzing the ferromagnetic Ising model. In this article, we extend the method to the non-ferromagnetic case. To show its usefulness, we derive a covariance identity for the heterogeneous one-dimensional Ising model, which recovers the correct rate of exponential decay of covariances in the case of random i.i.d. interaction and external field.</description>

Abstract: We establish new Harnack estimates that defy the waiting-time phenomenon for global solutions to nonlocal parabolic equations. Our technique allows us to consider general nonlocal operators with bounded measurable coefficients. Moreover, we show that a waiting-time is required for the nonlocal parabolic Harnack inequality when local solutions are considered.</description>

      <title>Martingale approach for first-passage problems of time-additive observables in Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method based on martingales to study first-passage problems of time-additive observables exiting an interval of finite width in a Markov process. In the limit that the interval width is large, we derive generic expressions for the splitting probability and the cumulants of the first-passage time. These expressions relate first-passage quantities to the large deviation properties of the time-additive observable. We find that there are three qualitatively different regimes depending on the properties of the large deviation rate function of the time-additive observable. These regimes correspond to exponential, super-exponential, or sub-exponential suppression of events at the unlikely boundary of the interval. Furthermore, we show that the statistics of first-passage times at both interval boundaries are in general different, even for symmetric thresholds and in the limit of large interval widths. While the statistics of the times to reach the likely boundary are determined by the cumulants of the time-additive observables in the original process, those at the unlikely boundary are determined by a dual process. We obtain these results from a one-parameter family of positive martingales that we call Perron martingales, as these are related to the Perron root of a tilted version of the transition rate matrix defining the Markov process. Furthermore, we show that each eigenpair of the tilted matrix has a one-parameter family of martingales. To solve first-passage problems at finite thresholds, we generally require all one-parameter families of martingales, including the non-positive ones. We illustrate this by solving the first-passage problem for run-and-tumble particles exiting an interval of finite width.</description>
