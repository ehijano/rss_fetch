      <title>FRA-DiagSys: A Transformer Winding Fault Diagnosis System for Identifying Fault Types and degrees Using Frequency Response Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric power transformer is a critical component in electrical distribution networks, and the diagnosis of faults in transformers is an important research area. Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) methods are widely used for analyzing winding faults in transformers, particularly in Chinese power stations. However, the current approach relies on manual expertise to interpret FRA curves, which can be both skill-intensive and lacks precision. This study presents a novel approach using a Multilayer perceptron model to directly model and analyze FRA data, simulating various winding fault types and degrees in 12-disc winding and 10-disc winding transformers with different connection configurations, resulting in three distinct datasets. Six different Multilayer perceptron architectures were developed, with optimal models achieving recognition accuracies of over 99.7% for diagnosing fault degrees and more than 90% for fault types. Hence, this paper has yielded a model architecture that exhibits commendable performance in diagnosing various fault types and their severities in different models of transformers when utilizing different FRA connection methods. Additionally, a specialized diagnostic system called FRA-DiagSys with two-stage model utilization was developed, achieving 100% accuracy in diagnosing fault types and degrees for a specific winding-10 power transformer, surpassing other diagnostic methods and strategies.</description>

      <title>Predicting Customer Goals in Financial Institution Services: A Data-Driven LSTM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's competitive financial landscape, understanding and anticipating customer goals is crucial for institutions to deliver a personalized and optimized user experience. This has given rise to the problem of accurately predicting customer goals and actions. Focusing on that problem, we use historical customer traces generated by a realistic simulator and present two simple models for predicting customer goals and future actions -- an LSTM model and an LSTM model enhanced with state-space graph embeddings. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models when it comes to predicting customer goals and actions.</description>

      <title>Temporal distribution of clusters of investors and their application in prediction with expert advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial organisations such as brokers face a significant challenge in servicing the investment needs of thousands of their traders worldwide. This task is further compounded since individual traders will have their own risk appetite and investment goals. Traders may look to capture short-term trends in the market which last only seconds to minutes, or they may have longer-term views which last several days to months. To reduce the complexity of this task, client trades can be clustered. By examining such clusters, we would likely observe many traders following common patterns of investment, but how do these patterns vary through time? Knowledge regarding the temporal distributions of such clusters may help financial institutions manage the overall portfolio of risk that accumulates from underlying trader positions. This study contributes to the field by demonstrating that the distribution of clusters derived from the real-world trades of 20k Foreign Exchange (FX) traders (from 2015 to 2017) is described in accordance with Ewens' Sampling Distribution. Further, we show that the Aggregating Algorithm (AA), an on-line prediction with expert advice algorithm, can be applied to the aforementioned real-world data in order to improve the returns of portfolios of trader risk. However we found that the AA 'struggles' when presented with too many trader ``experts'', especially when there are many trades with similar overall patterns. To help overcome this challenge, we have applied and compared the use of Statistically Validated Networks (SVN) with a hierarchical clustering approach on a subset of the data, demonstrating that both approaches can be used to significantly improve results of the AA in terms of profitability and smoothness of returns.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Approach to Multi-scale Brain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19708v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale differentiable brain modeling workflow utilizing BrainPy, a unique differentiable brain simulator that combines accurate brain simulation with powerful gradient-based optimization. We leverage this capability of BrainPy across different brain scales. At the single-neuron level, we implement differentiable neuron models and employ gradient methods to optimize their fit to electrophysiological data. On the network level, we incorporate connectomic data to construct biologically constrained network models. Finally, to replicate animal behavior, we train these models on cognitive tasks using gradient-based learning rules. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance and speed in fitting generalized leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley single neuron models. Additionally, training a biologically-informed network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons on working memory tasks successfully replicates observed neural activity and synaptic weight distributions. Overall, our differentiable multi-scale simulation approach offers a promising tool to bridge neuroscience data across electrophysiological, anatomical, and behavioral scales.</description>

      <title>Impact of Domain Knowledge and Multi-Modality on Intelligent Molecular Property Prediction: A Systematic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise prediction of molecular properties is essential for advancements in drug development, particularly in virtual screening and compound optimization. The recent introduction of numerous deep learning-based methods has shown remarkable potential in enhancing molecular property prediction (MPP), especially improving accuracy and insights into molecular structures. Yet, two critical questions arise: does the integration of domain knowledge augment the accuracy of molecular property prediction and does employing multi-modal data fusion yield more precise results than unique data source methods? To explore these matters, we comprehensively review and quantitatively analyze recent deep learning methods based on various benchmarks. We discover that integrating molecular information significantly improves molecular property prediction (MPP) for both regression and classification tasks. Specifically, regression improvements, measured by reductions in root mean square error (RMSE), are up to 4.0%, while classification enhancements, measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), are up to 1.7%. We also discover that enriching 2D graphs with 1D SMILES boosts multi-modal learning performance for regression tasks by up to 9.1%, and augmenting 2D graphs with 3D information increases performance for classification tasks by up to 13.2%, with both enhancements measured using ROC-AUC. The two consolidated insights offer crucial guidance for future advancements in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>AIGB: Generative Auto-bidding via Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding plays a crucial role in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for auto-bidding. However, most current RL auto-bidding methods are modeled through the Markovian Decision Process (MDP), which assumes the Markovian state transition. This assumption restricts the ability to perform in long horizon scenarios and makes the model unstable when dealing with highly random online advertising environments. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), a novel paradigm for auto-bidding through generative modeling. In this paradigm, we propose DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for bid generation. DiffBid directly models the correlation between the return and the entire trajectory, effectively avoiding error propagation across time steps in long horizons. Additionally, DiffBid offers a versatile approach for generating trajectories that maximize given targets while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffBid, achieving 2.81% increase in GMV and 3.36% increase in ROI.</description>
