      <title>Noise Modeling and Calibration of a Two-Stage Cryogenic Charge Amplifier for the SPLENDOR Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SPLENDOR Collaboration studies novel narrow-gap semiconductors and engineered a substrate agnostic detector platform to achieve $\mathcal{O}$(meV) energy sensitivity designed for low mass dark matter searches. This was achieved using low-capacitance and low-noise commercial CryoHEMTs in a split-stage topology integrated throughout a dilution refrigerator. Designed with a source-follower HEMT at the base temperature stage and a voltage amplifier at 4\,K, this amplifier has input-limited voltage noise of 10 $\text{nV}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and current noise of 100 $\text{aA}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 1kHz. In agreement with this noise level and a photon calibration, this amplifier has a $\text{19} \pm \text{4} $ electron resolution.</description>

      <title>Study of the response of a large volume TPC prototype for the CYGNO experiment at LNGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical and cosmological evidence strongly supports the existence of Dark Matter (DM), yet no candidate particle is predicted by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Among the most studied and hypotheses are Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMPs), which could account for the observed relic DM density through weak interactions in the early Universe. Direct detection experiments aim to observe low-energy nuclear recoils induced by DM interactions, requiring detectors with very low background levels and high sensitivity. The CYGNO project develops large gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) for directional DM searches. Using a helium- and fluorine-rich gas mixture, a triple GEM amplification system and optical readout via PMTs and scientific CMOS cameras, CYGNO enables 3D track reconstruction and sensitivity to both Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent interactions. Several prototypes have been built, culminating in the Long Imaging ModulE (LIME), a 50 L active volume TPC. Installed underground at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in 2022. LIME represents a milestone toward a full-scale directional DM detector. This thesis reports on the calibration and stability studies of LIME, presenting methods to control environmental effects on detector performance, a novel data equalisation technique and first sensitivity studies for DM detection. The results contribute to validating CYGNO's approach and advancing the roadmap toward large-scale directional Dark Matter searches.</description>

      <title>BabyMOSS stitched sensors: results of characterisation tests for ALICE ITS3 upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the Long Shutdown 3 (LS3, scheduled 2026-2030), the innermost 3 layers (Inner Barrel, or IB) of the present ALICE ITS2 will be replaced with large-area, flexible, stitched CMOS 65 nm sensors, arranged in 2 half-barrels of 3 half-layers each, in the framework of the ITS3 upgrade project. For the first time in a High Energy Physics experiment, such large-scale sensors will be bent into truly half-cylindrical shaped half-layers, requiring little mechanical support. This will also help lower the material budget: a reduction down to an average of 0.09% X$_{0}$ per layer is expected, benefitting ITS tracking and vertexing capabilities especially at low momenta.
  In the wafer yield and stitching assessment stage for ITS3 R&amp;D, test devices from the Engineering Run 1 (ER1) submission were developed, including the MOnolithic Stiched Sensors (MOSS) and smaller variants of them (babyMOSS). In particular, babyMOSS is a single Repeated Sensor Unit (RSU) of a MOSS device: the chip is $\sim14\times30$ mm$^{2}$ in size, and consists of 8 digitally read out pixel matrices (regions) arranged in 2 rows, i.e. half-units (HUs).
  BabyMOSS chip characterisation tests have been performed in laboratory and test beam environments. Laboratory tests include systematic functional scans to study the behaviour of front-end electronics over a range of different settings, whereas test beam measurements, under high-energy charged particle beams, were used to investigate the detection efficiency and spatial resolution.
  In this contribution, we will present the babyMOSS chip characterisation campaign, with a focus on recent test beam results. So far, babyMOSS test beam results have been consistent with full MOSS, and confirmed that babyMOSS devices meet the ITS3 requirements: a detection efficiency $&gt;99\%$, fake hit rate $&lt;10^{-6}$ hits per pixel and event, and a spatial resolution $&lt;6$ $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Dark characterization of Ti/Al LEKIDs for the search of axions in the W-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the electrical (dark) characterization of lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) fabricated from a Titanium/Aluminum bilayer and designed for broadband absorption in the W-band (75-110 GHz). These detectors are prototypes for future QCD axion search experiments within the Canfranc Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx), which demand sub 1e-19 W/Hz^0.5 sensitivities under low optical backgrounds. We combine a Mattis-Bardeen analysis to the temperature dependence of the detector parameters with noise spectroscopy to determine the electrical noise equivalent power (NEP). The minimum measured value for the electrical NEP is 3e-19 W/Hz0.5. Across the measured temperature range, we find that quasiparticle lifetime deviates from the expected BCS recombination law. Our analysis suggests that non-equilibrium relaxation is governed by spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap and phonon diffusion effects. This work sets the road-map to achieve suitable and ultra-sensitive detectors in the W-band for dark matter axion search experiments.</description>

      <title>The Application of VMM3A Readout for Multi-Grid Neutron Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The T-REX neutron spectrometer at the European Spallation Source will use Multi-Grid Technology, which is a voxelised proportional counter relying on\mathrm{^{10}B_{4}C} coatings to detect the scattered neutrons. Measurements of the position dependence of pulse-height and relative detection efficiency of a Multi-Grid prototype of the T-REX spectrometer are presented for two different schemes of signal-processing electronics based on the VMM3A ASIC and CREMAT technology. These measurements, intended to test the suitability of VMM3A for readout of the T-REX Multi-Grid, are compared with Monte Carlo simulations based on the Garfield++ and Geant4 tool kits.</description>

      <title>Gas Electroluminescence in a Dual Phase Xenon-Doped Argon Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noble element detectors using argon or xenon as the detection medium are widely used in the searches for rare neutrino and dark matter interactions. Xenon doping in liquid argon can preserve attractive properties of an argon target while enhancing the detectable signals with properties of xenon. In this work, we deployed a dual-phase liquid argon detector with up to 4% xenon doping in the liquid and studied its gas electroluminescence properties as a function of xenon concentration. At $\sim$2% xenon doping in liquid argon, we measured $\sim$34 ppm of xenon in the gas and observed $\sim$2.5 times larger electroluminescence signals in the detector than those in pure argon. By analyzing signals recorded by photosensors of different wavelength sensitivities, we confirm that the argon gas electroluminescence process is strongly affected by the addition of xenon. We propose an analytical model to describe the underlying energy transfer mechanism in argon-xenon gas mixtures. Lastly, the implications of this measurement for low energy ionization signal detection will be discussed.</description>

      <title>WISPFI Experiment: Prototype Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates that couple to photons in external magnetic fields. The parameter space around $m_a \sim 50~\mu$eV remains largely unexplored by haloscope experiments. We present the first prototype of WISP Searches on a Fiber Interferometer (WISPFI), a table-top, model-independent scheme based on resonant photon-axion conversion in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) integrated into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Operating near a dark fringe with active phase-locking, combined with amplitude modulation, the interferometer converts axion-induced photon disappearance into a measurable signal. A 2 W, 1550 nm laser is coupled into a 1 m-long HC-PCF placed inside a 2 T permanent magnet array, probing a fixed axion mass of $m_a \simeq 49~\mu$eV with a projected sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \gtrsim 1.3 \times 10^{-9}~\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for a measurement time of 30 days. Future upgrades, including pressure tuning of the effective refractive index and implementation of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity, could extend the accessible mass range and improve sensitivity, establishing WISPFI as a scalable platform to explore previously inaccessible regions of the axion parameter space.</description>

      <title>A Drone-mounted Magnetometer System for Automatic Interference Removal and Landmine Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landmines have been extensively used in conflict zones as an indiscriminate weapon to control military movements, often remaining active long after hostilities have ended. Their presence poses a persistent danger to civilians, hindering post-war recovery efforts, causing injuries or death, and restricting access to essential land for agriculture and infrastructure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with magnetometers are commonly used to detect remnant hidden landmines but come with significant technical challenges due to magnetic field interference from UAV electronics such as motors. We propose the use of a frame-mounted UAV-borne two-magnetometer payload to perform a two-step automated interference removal and landmine detection analysis. The first step removes interference via the Wavelet-Adaptive Interference Cancellation for Underdetermined Platform (WAIC-UP) method designed for spaceflight magnetometers. The second method uses the Rapid Unsupervised Detection of Events (RUDE) algorithm to detect landmine signatures. This two-step WAIC-UP/RUDE approach with multiple magnetometers achieves high-fidelity ordinance detection at a low computational cost and simplifies the design of magnetic survey payloads. We validate the method through a Monte Carlo simulation of randomized landmine placements in a 10 x 10 m square grid and drone motor interference. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of the algorithm by varying the drone's altitude, examining its performance at different heights above the ground.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Event Reconstruction in the CMS Phase-2 High Granularity Calorimeter Endcap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-luminosity era of the LHC will offer greatly increased number of events for more precise Standard Model measurements and Beyond Standard Model searches, but will also pose unprecedented challenges to the detectors. To meet these challenges, the CMS detector will undergo several upgrades, including the replacement of the current endcap calorimeters with a novel High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL). To make optimal use of this innovative detector, new and original algorithms are being devised. A dedicated reconstruction framework, The Iterative Clustering (TICL), is being developed within the CMS Software (CMSSW). This new framework is designed to fully exploit the high spatial resolution and precise timing information provided by HGCAL. Several key ingredients of the object reconstruction chain already rely on Machine Learning (ML) techniques and their usage is expected to further develop in the future. The existing reconstruction strategies will be presented stressing the role played by ML techniques to exploit the information provided by the detector. The areas where ML techniques are expected to play a role in the future developments will be also discussed.</description>

      <title>In Situ Observation of Proton-Induced DNA Fragmentation in the Bragg Peak: Evidence for a Protective Role of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report in situ single-molecule measurements of proton-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA immersed in water, using real-time fluorescence tracking along the entire proton path, including the Bragg peak region. By chemically suppressing radical-mediated processes, we isolate direct DNA damage mechanisms and determine DSB cross sections as a function of depth. Near the Bragg peak, we observe a tenfold reduction in DSB cross sections in aqueous DNA compared to dry DNA, providing quantitative evidence for the protective role of water. These findings highlight the importance of intermolecular energy dissipation in mitigating radiation-induced damage in condensed biological matter, with implications for radiobiology and proton therapy modeling.</description>

      <title>Cross-Polarization Reduction in Kinetic Inductance Detectors Based on Quasi-Lumped Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) have emerged as a leading technology for millimeter- and submillimeter-wave astronomy due to their high sensitivity, natural multiplexing capabilities and scalable fabrication. In polarization-sensitive applications-such as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies-cross-polarization, or unintended response to the orthogonal polarization, poses a significant limitation to measurement fidelity. This work investigates the origin of cross-polarization in meandered Lumped Element KIDs (LEKIDs), with particular emphasis on the role of parasitic currents in the interdigitated capacitor. A comparative study between conventional LEKIDs and a quasi-lumped resonator design is presented, demonstrating that removing the capacitive element may improve cross-polarization discrimination, confirming the capacitor's contribution to polarization leakage.</description>

      <title>Predicting the single-site and multi-site event discrimination power of dual-phase time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers (TPCs) are widely used in searches for rare dark matter and neutrino interactions, in part because of their excellent position reconstruction capability in 3D. Despite their millimeter-scale resolution along the charge drift axis, xenon TPCs face challenges in resolving single-site (SS) and multi-site (MS) interactions in the transverse plane. In this paper, we build a generic TPC model with an idealized light-based signal readout, and use Fisher Information (FI) to study its theoretical capability of differentiating SS and MS events. We also demonstrate via simulation that this limit can be approached with conventional reconstruction algorithms like maximum likelihood estimation, and with a convolutional neural network classifier. The implications of this study on future TPC experiments will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of embedded $^{163}$Ho on the performance of the transition-edge sensor microcalorimeters of the HOLMES experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the performance of transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters with $^{163}$Ho atoms embedded by ion implantation, as part of the HOLMES experiment aimed at neutrino mass determination. The inclusion of $^{163}$Ho atoms introduces an excess heat capacity due to a pronounced Schottky anomaly, which can affect the detector's energy resolution, signal height, and response time. We fabricated TES arrays with varying levels of $^{163}$Ho activity and characterized their performance in terms of energy resolution, decay time constants, and heat capacity. The intrinsic energy resolution was found to degrade with increasing $^{163}$Ho activity, consistent with the expected scaling of heat capacity. From the analysis, we determined the specific heat capacity of $^{163}$Ho to be $(2.9 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.7 \mathrm{(sys)})$ J/K/mol at $(94 \pm 1)$\,mK, close to the literature values for metallic holmium. No additional long decay time constants correlated with $^{163}$Ho activity were observed, indicating that the excess heat capacity does not introduce weakly coupled thermodynamic systems. These results suggest that our present TES microcalorimeters can tolerate $^{163}$Ho activities up to approximately 5 Bq without significant performance degradation. For higher activities, reducing the TES transition temperature is necessary to maintain energy resolution. These findings provide critical insights for optimizing TES microcalorimeters for future neutrino mass experiments and other applications requiring embedded radioactive sources. The study also highlights the robustness of TES technology in handling implanted radionuclides while maintaining high-resolution performance.</description>

Abstract: We report the fabrication and optical characterization of an air-suspended photonic crystal nanobeam cavity in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) realized by focused-ion-beam milling. YIG's combination of low optical loss and ferrimagnetism makes it highly attractive for quantum technologies, yet prior work has largely been focused on millimeter-scale spheres and simple microstructures, hindering true on-chip integration. Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance. Finite-element simulations predict that the same structure supports a flapping-type mechanical mode at $\Omega / 2\pi \approx 1.52 \,\text{GHz}$ and a backward-volume spin-wave mode at $\Omega / 2\pi = 11.59 \,\text{GHz}$ under an in-plane bias field. Although we measure only the photonic resonance (intrinsic $Q \sim 2 \times 10^{3}$) in this study, the device lays the groundwork for future exploration of coupled photon-phonon-magnon dynamics once higher optical quality factors are achieved.</description>

      <title>Phase noise measurement of semiconductor optical amplifiers</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel measurement method for the phase noise measurement of optical amplifiers, topologically similar to the Heterodyne Mach-Zehnder Interferometer but governed by different principles, and we report on the measurement of a fibered amplifier at 1.55 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength. The amplifier under test (DUT) is inserted in one arm of a symmetrical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, with an AOM in the other arm. We measure the phase noise of the RF beat detected at the Mach-Zehnder output. The phase noise floor of the amplifier decreases proportionally to the reciprocal of the laser power at the amplifier input, down to $-125$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=100$ $\mathrm{kHz}$. The DUT flicker noise cannot be measured because it is lower than the background of the setup. This sets an upper bound of the amplifier noise at $-32$ $\mathrm{dBrad^2/Hz}$ at $f=1$ $\mathrm{Hz}$, which corresponds to a frequency stability of $5.2{\times}10^{-17}/\tau$ (Allan deviation), where $\tau$ is the integration time. Such noise level is lower than that of most Fabry-Perot cavity-stabilized lasers. These results are of interest in a wide range of applications including metrology, instrumentation, optical communications, or fiber links.</description>
