      <title>Constructive community race: full-density spiking neural network model drives neuromorphic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local circuitry of the mammalian brain is a focus of the search for generic computational principles because it is largely conserved across species and modalities. In 2014 a model was proposed representing all neurons and synapses of the stereotypical cortical microcircuit below $1\,\text{mm}^2$ of brain surface. The model reproduces fundamental features of brain activity but its impact remained limited because of its computational demands. For theory and simulation, however, the model was a breakthrough because it removes uncertainties of downscaling, and larger models are less densely connected. This sparked a race in the neuromorphic computing community and the model became a de facto standard benchmark. Within a few years real-time performance was reached and surpassed at significantly reduced energy consumption. We review how the computational challenge was tackled by different simulation technologies and derive guidelines for the next generation of benchmarks and other domains of science.</description>

      <title>FastCache: Fast Caching for Diffusion Transformer Through Learnable Linear Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are powerful generative models but remain computationally intensive due to their iterative structure and deep transformer stacks. To alleviate this inefficiency, we propose FastCache, a hidden-state-level caching and compression framework that accelerates DiT inference by exploiting redundancy within the model's internal representations. FastCache introduces a dual strategy: (1) a spatial-aware token selection mechanism that adaptively filters redundant tokens based on hidden state saliency, and (2) a transformer-level cache that reuses latent activations across timesteps when changes are statistically insignificant. These modules work jointly to reduce unnecessary computation while preserving generation fidelity through learnable linear approximation. Theoretical analysis shows that FastCache maintains bounded approximation error under a hypothesis-testing-based decision rule. Empirical evaluations across multiple DiT variants demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and memory usage, with best generation output quality compared to other cache methods, as measured by FID and t-FID. Code implementation of FastCache is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NoakLiu/FastCache-xDiT.</description>

      <title>Avoid Forgetting by Preserving Global Knowledge Gradients in Federated Learning with Non-IID Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inevitable presence of data heterogeneity has made federated learning very challenging. There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as local regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though effective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect the global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing an experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example. Our observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer from forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn the perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights, and clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained optimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning framework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its forgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion, we design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further calibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of learned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an episodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to regulate the gradient updates at each step of local training. Experimental results demonstrate that FedProj outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Scheduling with Uncertain Holding Costs and its Application to Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In content moderation for social media platforms, the cost of delaying the review of a content is proportional to its view trajectory, which fluctuates and is apriori unknown. Motivated by such uncertain holding costs, we consider a queueing model where job states evolve based on a Markov chain with state-dependent instantaneous holding costs. We demonstrate that in the presence of such uncertain holding costs, the two canonical algorithmic principles, instantaneous-cost ($c\mu$-rule) and expected-remaining-cost ($c\mu/\theta$-rule), are suboptimal. By viewing each job as a Markovian ski-rental problem, we develop a new index-based algorithm, Opportunity-adjusted Remaining Cost (OaRC), that adjusts to the opportunity of serving jobs in the future when uncertainty partly resolves. We show that the regret of OaRC scales as $\tilde{O}(L^{1.5}\sqrt{N})$, where $L$ is the maximum length of a job's holding cost trajectory and $N$ is the system size. This regret bound shows that OaRC achieves asymptotic optimality when the system size $N$ scales to infinity. Moreover, its regret is independent of the state-space size, which is a desirable property when job states contain contextual information. We corroborate our results with an extensive simulation study based on two holding cost patterns (online ads and user-generated content) that arise in content moderation for social media platforms. Our simulations based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that OaRC consistently outperforms existing practice, which is based on the two canonical algorithmic principles.</description>

      <title>EPIC: Efficient Position-Independent Caching for Serving Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great capabilities in a wide range of applications, but serving them efficiently becomes increasingly challenging as requests (prompts) become more complex. Context caching improves serving performance by reusing Key-Value (KV) vectors, the intermediate representations of tokens that are repeated across requests. However, existing context caching requires exact prefix matches across requests, limiting reuse cases in settings such as few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation, where immutable content (e.g., documents) remains unchanged across requests but is preceded by varying prefixes. Position-Independent Caching (PIC) addresses this issue by enabling modular reuse of the KV vectors regardless of prefixes. We formalize PIC and advance prior work by introducing EPIC, a serving system incorporating our new LegoLink algorithm, which mitigates the inappropriate "attention sink" effect at every document beginning, to maintain accuracy with minimal computation. Experiments show that EPIC achieves up to 8x improvements in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7x throughput gains over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss.</description>
