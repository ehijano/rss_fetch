      <title>Thermodynamic description of world GDP distribution over countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the concept of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of classical fields for a description of the world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) distribution over countries. The thermalization appears due to a variety of interactions between countries with conservation of two integrals being total GDP and probability (norm). In such a case there is an emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans condensation at states with low GDP. This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of the well-known Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations is used to describe surface processes, such as simultaneous adsorption/desorption and surface diffusion. In the present paper we have considered the convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn equation complemented by memory effects. Exact solutions are obtained and the combined action of the applied field, dissipation and memory are discussed.</description>

      <title>Free energy dissipation and a decomposition of general jump diffusions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ without detailed balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamic structure of jump diffusions combining Brownian and Poisson noise, a class of stochastic dynamics relevant to nonequilibrium statistical physics. For such nonlocal dynamics, the free energy admits a full dissipation formula that decomposes into entropy production and housekeeping heat. A central result is a decomposition of the generator into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts with respect to the invariant measure $\rho_{ss}$. The symmetric sector corresponds to a reversible dynamics and yields a nonlocal Fisher information governing free-energy decay, whereas the anti-symmetric sector generates a canonical conservative flow that produces circulation but no dissipation. Several numerical examples demonstrate how this decomposition clarifies the structure of nonequilibrium stationary states in jump-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Geometry protected probabilistic structure in many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insomuch as statistical mechanics circumvents the formidable task of addressing many-body dynamics, it remains a challenge to derive macroscopic properties from a solution to Hamiltonian equations for microscopic motion of an isolated system. Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume. Our findings may have applications in nonlinear optics and cold-atom dynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-organized criticality in complex model ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spatial extensions of many-species population dynamics models, such as the Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions we focus on in this work, generically exhibit scale-free correlation functions of population sizes in the limit of an infinite number of species. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we describe the many-species system in terms of single-species dynamics with demographic and environmental noises. We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Statistical structural properties of many-body chaotic eigenfunctions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a semiperturbative theory to study the statistical structural properties of energy eigenfunctions (EFs) in many-body quantum chaotic systems consisting of a central system coupled to an environment. Under certain assumptions, we derive both the average shape and the statistical fluctuations of EFs on the basis formed by the direct product of the energy eigenbases of the system and the environment. Furthermore, we apply our results to two fundamental questions: (i) the properties of the reduced density matrix of the central system in an eigenstate, and (ii) the structure of the off-diagonal smooth function within the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Numerical results are also presented in support of our main findings.</description>

      <title>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference and prediction are fundamental to the study of complex systems, where network data are often incomplete, inaccurate or obtained indirectly. In this paper, we review recent advances in network sampling and comparison, as well as in link prediction and network reconstruction from time series. We summarise key methodological developments and emerging approaches that integrate statistical and machine learning perspectives. We also outline promising research directions for enhancing the inference and prediction of complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.</description>

      <title>Boundary Criticality of Complex Conformal Field Theory: A Case Study in the Non-Hermitian 5-State Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal fields with boundaries give rise to rich critical phenomena that can reveal information about the underlying conformality. While most existing studies focus on Hermitian systems, here we explore boundary critical phenomena in a non-Hermitian quantum 5-state Potts model which exhibits complex conformality in the bulk. We identify free, fixed and mixed conformal boundary conditions and observe the conformal tower structure of energy spectra, supporting the emergence of conformal boundary criticality. We also studied the duality relation between different conformal boundary conditions under the Kramers-Wannier transformation. These findings should facilitate a comprehensive understanding for complex CFTs and stimulate further exploration on the boundary critical phenomena within non-Hermitian strongly-correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Characterization of Anisotropic Correlations via Mutual Information Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing anisotropic correlations in quantum and statistical systems requires a coordinate-invariant framework. We introduce a geometric map based on the local informational line element, calibrated by the Euclidean benchmark scale $C_{\mathrm{vac}}$: $ds^{2} = C_{\mathrm{vac}}/I(x,x+\epsilon)$. We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \propto \delta_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}\gamma_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $\gamma_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $\gamma_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims.</description>

      <title>Strong zero modes in integrable spin-S chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact strong zero mode (ESZM) operators for integrable spin-S chains with open boundary conditions and a boundary field. Their locality properties are generally weaker than in the previously known cases, but they still imply infinite coherence times in the vicinity of the edges. We explain how such integrable chains possess multiple ground states describing a first-order quantum phase transition, and that the odd number of such states for integer S makes the weaker locality properties necessary. We make contact with more traditional approaches by showing how the ESZM for S=1/2 acts on energy eigenstates given by solutions of the Bethe equations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous coarsening and nonlinear diffusion of kinks in an one-dimensional quasi-classical Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase-ordering dynamics of a quasi-classical Holstein model. At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems.</description>

      <title>Universal bounds on entropy production from fluctuating coarse-grained trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy production is arguably the most universally applicable measure of non-equilibrium behavior, particularly for systems coupled to a heat bath. This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories.</description>

      <title>A dynamical order parameter for the transition to nonergodic dynamics in the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLSE) exhibits a transition from ergodic, delocalized dynamics to a weakly nonergodic regime characterized by breather formation; yet, a precise characterization of this transition has remained elusive. By sampling many microcanonically equivalent initial conditions, we identify the asymptotic ensemble variance of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy as a dynamical order parameter that vanishes in the ergodic phase and becomes finite once ergodicity is broken. The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. This reformulation and reinterpretation goes beyond recent developments that treat Renormalization Group flow equations as conservation laws in field space and also allows to systematically understand and handle the nonconservative contributions in flow equations numerically.
  We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more realistic systems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in unitary system-bath dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</description>

      <title>Maximally Symmetric Boost-Invariant Solutions of the Boltzmann Equation in Foliated Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the relativistic kinetic theory of a boost-invariant conformal gas on a static, maximally symmetric background $dS_3\times \mathbb{R}$, considering all constant-curvature slicings of $dS_3$ - flat, spherical, or hyperbolic- and their associated symmetry groups. Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Entropic Confinement and Mode Connectivity in Overparameterized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern neural networks exhibit a striking property: basins of attraction in the loss landscape are often connected by low-loss paths, yet optimization dynamics generally remain confined to a single convex basin and rarely explore intermediate points. We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations can generate atomically detailed trajectories of complex systems, but analyzing these dynamics can be challenging when systems lack well-established quantitative descriptors (features). Graph neural networks (GNNs) in which messages are passed between nodes that represent atoms that are spatial neighbors promise to obviate manual feature engineering, but the use of GNNs with biomolecular systems of more than a few hundred residues has been limited in the context of analyzing dynamics by both difficulties in capturing the details of long-range interactions with message passing and the memory and runtime requirements associated with large graphs. Here, we show how local information can be aggregated to reduce memory and runtime requirements without sacrificing atomic detail. We demonstrate that this approach opens the door to analyzing simulations of protein-nucleic acid complexes with thousands of residues on single GPUs within minutes. For systems with hundreds of residues, for which there are sufficient data to make quantitative comparisons, we show that the approach improves performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Surface energy-driven crumpling transition in a thin sheet under compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our common experience, crumpling a sheet requires external compressive force and leads to a random network of folds. However, thin sheets have been theoretically predicted to spontaneously transition from a flat to a crumpled state driven by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon that has been elusive in experiments. We report the first observation of a similar crumpling transition driven instead by surface energy. Using a sensitive experimental protocol, when we gently compress a thin polymer sheet weakly adhered to a hydrogel substrate it transitions to a self-crumpling state at a well defined critical compression independent of system details. The transition is marked by the percolation of a fold network, and a power law increase in fold density. Most remarkably, the crumpled state shows a tunable order of folds establishing the phenomenon's potential as a simple and scalable technique to do origami with extremely thin sheets.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Standard Quantum Detailed Balance and Thermodynamically Consistent Entropy Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that if a quantum Markovian semigroup satisfies the standard quantum detailed balance condition, its generator admits a special representation that yields a vanishing entropy production rate. Conversely, if the generator admits a special representation adhering to the condition of thermodynamic consistency and leading to a vanishing entropy production rate, then the corresponding quantum Markovian semigroup must satisfy the standard quantum detailed balance condition. In this context, we adopt the definition of entropy production rate that is motivated by the physics literature and standard for thermodynamically consistent Lindbladians.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical phenomena of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4,5$ and 6 are investigated using the technique of supervised neural network (NN). Unlike the conventional NN approaches, here we train a multilayer perceptron consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer with two artificially made stagger-like configurations. Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Surface-directed spinodal decomposition in binary fluid mixtures on an amorphous wall: A molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present molecular dynamics (MD) results to discuss wetting kinetics in binary fluid mixtures ($A:B=50:50$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition (SDSD) on an amorphous wall. Our simulations show the formation of a wetting layer rich in the preferred $A$-type particles and bicontinuous domain morphology in the bulk. In addition, the mixture maintains connectivity between the bulk and the wetting layer through $A$-rich tubes throughout the depletion region. The wetting layer thickness coarsens as a power law, $R_1(t)\sim t^{\alpha}$, with two distinct growth regimes of $\alpha=1/3$ and $\alpha=1$ active for at least a decade. The computed crossover time for $\alpha=1/3 \to 1$ equaled the reported bulk crossover time, and the corresponding crossover length scale $R_c$ agrees well with the expression $\Lambda = \sqrt{2k/\gamma_0}$ given by Scholten et al.~[\emph{Macromolecules}2005, 38, 3515] for bicontinuous domains in aqueous polymer mixtures in the presence of only one dominant length scale. This agreement supports a hydrodynamic picture of diffusive growth for the interconnected wetting layer and bulk domains, where the bending contribution ($k$) of curvature-dependent $AB$ interfacial tension ($\gamma$) governs small-scale coarsening, producing $t^{1/3}$ growth. For length scales beyond $\Lambda$, capillary flows yield the viscous hydrodynamic regime ($\sim t$). Our results show no orientational effects on the domain coarsening parallel and perpendicular to the wall, contrasting many continuum models, including combinations with Flory-Huggins theory.</description>

      <title>Pauli Master Equation numerical analysis of coherent and incoherent dressed fermions in triplet unconventional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report two types of dressed fermions in a triplet superconductor with an in-situ disorder effective field. They are obtained numerically by analyzing with the Pauli Master Equation, the self-consistent imaginary part data of the elastic-scattering cross-section. We use a two-component irreducible representation of the order parameter with quasi-point nodes and study the quasi-classical effective probabilistic density distribution as function of disorder. We find a stable coherent quantum state of dressed fermions, and slow characteristic decay time for dilute disorder. Also, we find an incoherent quantum state with diffused dressed fermions and enriched disorder with self-consistency increasing decoherence, a fast characteristic decay time, and a diffuse unitary resonance. We conclude that the most stable dressed fermion states are those in which the field has dilute disorder, the threshold zero gap, and some dressed fermions behave like an s-wave superconductor, showing a tiny gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects arise in many complex systems, from protein folding, to the spreading of epidemics and financial decisions. While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gibbs Ensemble from Eigenstate Entanglement Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxed quantum systems with conservation laws are believed to be approximated by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which incorporates the constraints of certain conserved quantities serving as integrals of motion. By drawing an analogy between eigenstate reduced density matrix and GGE, we conjecture that a natural set of conserved quantities for GGE can emerge from the reduced density matrices of properly chosen eigenstates by the entanglement Hamiltonian superdensity matrix (EHSM) framework, and we demonstrate this explicitly for models mappable to free fermions. The framework proposes that such conserved quantities are linear superpositions of eigenstate entanglement Hamiltonians of a larger auxiliary system, where the eigenstates are Fock states occupying what we call the common eigenmodes, which remain eigenmodes when truncated within the physical subsystem. For 1D homogeneous free fermions with (anti-)periodic boundary conditions, which maps to 1D hardcore bosons with nearest neighbor hoppings, these conserved quantities lead to a non-Abelian GGE, which predicts the relaxation of both fermion and boson bilinears more accurately than the conventional Abelian GGE. Generalization of this framework may provide novel numerical insights for quantum integrability.</description>

      <title>The exact mobility edges in SVQL (slowly-varying quasiperiodic ladder) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal two-leg ladder model in which the mobility edge (ME) arises solely due to bond modulation, introduced through a slowly varying quasiperiodic modulation in the inter-leg tunnelling amplitudes. We demonstrate that this bond-modulated ladder naturally hosts two propagation channels, whose symmetric and antisymmetric combinations experience opposite effective onsite potentials, unlike the one-dimensional quasiperiodic models with onsite modulations. Using the adiabatic (slowly varying) limit of the modulation, we derive an exact analytical condition for the single-particle mobility edge, $E_c=\pm|2t-\lambda|,$ where $t$ is the hopping amplitude along both the legs and $\lambda$ is the bond modulation strength. This result directly generalizes the classic ME condition for slowly varying onsite potentials to a multi-leg (two-leg in our case) geometry. Extensive numerical calculations, including inverse participation ratios, Lyapunov exponents, density of states, and participation-ratio scaling, demonstrate excellent agreement with the analytical prediction across a wide range of parameters. We further identify a regime for small modulation exponents $0 &lt; \nu &lt;1$, where localized and weakly delocalized states coexist even beyond the transition point ($\lambda_c=2t$). Our results establish that a deterministic bond modulation can serve as a sufficient ingredient to produce an exact ME in ladder systems, offering experimentally accessible routes toward tuning nonergodic extended phases.</description>

Abstract: Kinetics of biological motors such as kinesin or dynein is notably influenced by viscoelastic intracellular environment. The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of Hilbert space fragmentation, freezing transition, and its effects in the family of quantum East models involving varying range of constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the effect of strong-to-weak fragmentation transition, namely freezing transition, and its rich characteristics in a family of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models involving short-to-long-range facilitated hoppings with an East constraint. Focusing on this family of models with range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding of the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and transfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the freezing transition in this family of models with the help of the generalization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q&gt;1$, further revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the transition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This distinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at multiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality with logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation exemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the thermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which includes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation profiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on the transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up to range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous transport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation through superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation structure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints. In brevity, our paper reveals intriguing possibilities conspired by an intriguing interplay between constraints with varying ranges, fragmentation structure, and freezing transition.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on energy use in quasi-static Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) has brought increasing attention to their energy use during training and inference. Here, we establish the thermodynamic bounds on energy consumption in quasi-static analog DNNs by mapping modern feedforward architectures onto a physical free-energy functional. This framework provides a direct statistical-mechanical interpretation of quasi-static DNNs. As a result, inference can proceed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, with vanishing minimal energy cost, in contrast to the Landauer limit that constrains digital hardware. Importantly, inference corresponds to relaxation to a unique free-energy minimum with F_{\min}=0, allowing all constraints to be satisfied without residual stress. By comparison, training overconstrains the system: simultaneous clamping of inputs and outputs generates stresses that propagate backward through the architecture, reproducing the rules of backpropagation. Parameter annealing then relaxes these stresses, providing a purely physical route to learning without an explicit loss function. We further derive a universal lower bound on training energy, E&lt; 2NDkT, which scales with both the number of trainable parameters and the dataset size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by overdamped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap of the symmetrized time-evolution operator closes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.</description>

      <title>Integrating Macrostate Probability Distributions with Swing Adsorption Modeling for Binary/Ternary Gas Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enables high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.</description>

      <title>An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step, resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. The key idea is that, when trajectories enter the stable states, the times that they enter (stopping times) must be used for estimating the committor and transition rate instead of the lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We show how further accuracy for the transition rate can be achieved by combining results from two lag times. We also relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}&gt;0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Shape dependence of entanglement negativity and mutual information in quantum Hall and critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two entanglement measures in a large family of isotropic many-body states including incompressible quantum Hall liquids and quantum critical systems: the logarithmic negativity (LN), and mutual information (MI). For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting insights from data, but their training is hindered by the slow mixing of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) processes, especially with highly structured datasets. In this study, we build on recent theoretical advances in RBM training and focus on the stepwise encoding of data patterns into singular vectors of the coupling matrix, significantly reducing the cost of generating new samples and evaluating the quality of the model, as well as the training cost in highly clustered datasets. The learning process is analogous to the thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. We leverage the continuous transitions in the training process to define a smooth annealing trajectory that enables reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimates. This approach enables online assessment during training and introduces a novel sampling strategy called Parallel Trajectory Tempering (PTT) that outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. To mitigate the critical slowdown effect in the early stages of training, we propose a pre-training phase. In this phase, the principal components are encoded into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process, facilitating efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. Our results demonstrate that this pre-training strategy allows RBMs to efficiently handle highly structured datasets where conventional methods fail. Additionally, our log-likelihood estimation outperforms computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios, while the PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for subsystem trace distance. This result demonstrates that perturbative quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation.</description>

Abstract: Light-matter systems that exhibit two-photon interactions have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring quantum applications. In this work, we focus on the two-photon Dicke model, a system of significant experimental relevance that displays spectral collapse and undergoes a phase transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.</description>

Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Quantum Turbulence in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate via the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a continuous phase transition driven at a finite rate. We propose the generation of spontaneous quantum turbulence (SQT) via the KZM during Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a thermal quench. Using numerical simulations of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two spatial dimensions, we describe the formation of a newborn Bose-Einstein condensate proliferated by quantum vortices. We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>How to simulate L\'evy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Pontus-Mpemba effects via dynamical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that open quantum systems exhibiting dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) allow for efficient protocols implementing the Pontus-Mpemba effect. The relaxation speed-up toward a predesignated target state is tied to the existence of a long metastable time window preceding the DPT and can be exploited in applications to systematically optimize quantum protocols. As paradigmatic example for the connection between DPTs and quantum Mpemba effects, we study one-dimensional (1D) interacting lattice fermions corresponding to a dissipative variant of the Gross-Neveu (GN) model.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Imaginary-Time Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a novel class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional columnar dimerized Heisenberg model. Notably, the observed transitions do not fall into any previously established universality classes. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional systems. In addition, the representation provides a natural interpretation of the phase transitions in terms of cluster formation within the simulations. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we construct a chiral model mapping overdamped agents to supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the sound radiation of shallow water flows. We show that disorder activates a topological heat pump driving an inverse cascade toward a negative-temperature Onsager dipole, unless arrested into a vortex glass by insufficient dispersion. This mapping identifies a universality class unifying active swarms with the statistical mechanics of classical inviscid fluids.</description>
