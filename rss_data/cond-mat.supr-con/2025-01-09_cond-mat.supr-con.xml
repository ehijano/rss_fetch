      <title>Obstacles to two-line Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obstacles to the two-line Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) designs, aimed at increasing the allowed pump wave energy and, hence, the gain growth through the combination of linear and nonlinear lines as pump and signal lines is discussed. This analysis takes into account both the mutual coupling and the discreteness of the artificial waveguide lines. Significant restrictions arise from the cyclical transfer of the traveling wave's energy from one line to the other one with phase step by $\pi$ every beat cycle. Moreover, the other restrictions result from the phase mismatch between the pump, signal and idler waves due to both the coupling and the discreteness of the artificial lines.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of $p$-wave Magnetism and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open a new avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic generation of superflow in a fermionic ring through phase imprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamic generation of persistent current by phase imprinting fermionic atoms in a ring geometry. Mediated by the pairing interaction, the Fermi condensate dynamically acquires a quantized current by developing azimuthal phase slips, as well as density and pairing-order-parameter depletions. Resorting to the Bogolioubov-de Gennes formalism, we investigate the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized superfluid current throughout the phase-imprinting process. This enables a detailed analysis of the impact of interaction, as well as different initial pairing states, on the superflow formation. In particular, we show that, as the condensate is tuned toward the Bose-Einstein-condensate side of the Feshbach resonance, the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential, leading to smaller quantized current under the same imprinting parameters. Our results offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow in the phase-imprinting process, and are helpful for the ongoing experimental effort.</description>

      <title>Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>
