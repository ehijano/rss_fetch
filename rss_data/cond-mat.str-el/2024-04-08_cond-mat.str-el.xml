      <title>Singlet, triplet, and mixed all-to-all pairings emerging from incoherent fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling in complex materials can be more complicated than simple density-density interactions, involving intertwined dynamics of spin, charge, and spatial symmetries. This motivates studying universal models with complex interactions, and studying whether in this case BCS-type singlet pairing is still the ``natural'' fate of the system. To this end, we construct a Yukawa-SYK model with nonlocal couplings in both spin and charge channels. Furthermore, we provide for time-reversal-symmetry breaking dynamics by averaging over the Gaussian Unitary ensemble rather than the Orthogonal ensemble. We find that the ground state of the system can be an orbitally nonlocal superconducting state arising from incoherent fermions with no BCS-like analog. The superconductivity has an equal tendency to triplet and singlet pairing states separated by a non-Fermi liquid phase. We further study the fate of the system within the superconducting phase and find that the expected ground state, away from the critical point, is a mixed singlet/triplet state. Finally, we find that while at $T_c$ the triplet and singlet transitions are dual to one another, below $T_c$ the duality is broken, with the triplet state more susceptible to orbital fluctuations just by virtue of its symmetry. Our results indicate that such fluctuation-induced mixed states may be an inherent feature of strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics and possible topological magnons in non-stoichiometric pyrochlore iridate Tb$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ studied by RIXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a resonant inelastic X-ray scattering study on a single crystal of a non-stoichiometric pyrochlore iridate Tb$_{2+x}$Ir$_{2-x}$O$_{7-y}$ ($x \simeq 0.25$) that magnetically orders at $T_{\rm{N}}\simeq 50$ K. We find that the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the trigonal distortion of the IrO$_6$ octahedra are comparable with the ones obtained in other pyrochlore iridates. We observe a propagating gapped magnon mode at low energy, and model it using a Hamiltonian consisting of a Heisenberg exchange [$J = 16.2(9)$ meV] and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions [$D = 5.2(3)$ meV], which shows the robustness of interactions despite Tb-stuffing at the Ir-site. Strikingly, the ratio $D/J = 0.32(3)$ supports possible non-trivial topological magnon band crossing. This material may thus host coexisting fermionic and bosonic topology, with potential for manipulating electronic and magnonic topological bands thanks to the $d-f$ interaction.</description>

      <title>Emergent photons and fractionalized excitations in a quantum spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum spin liquid (QSL) arises from a highly entangled superposition of many degenerate classical ground states in a frustrated magnet, and is characterized by emergent gauge fields and deconfined fractionalized excitations (spinons). Because such a novel phase of matter is relevant to high-transition-temperature superconductivity and quantum computation, the microscopic understanding of QSL states is a long-sought goal in condensed matter physics. The 3D pyrochlore lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra can host a QSL with U(1) gauge fields called quantum spin ice (QSI), which is a quantum (with effective $S=1/2$) analog of the classical (with large effective moment) spin ice. A key difference between QSI and classical spin ice is the predicted presence of the linearly dispersing collective excitations near zero energy, dubbed the "photons", arising from emergent quantum electrodynamics, in addition to the spinons at higher energies. Recently, 3D pyrochlore systems Ce2M2O7 (M = Sn, Zr, Hf) have been suggested as effective $S=1/2$ QSI candidates, but there has been no evidence of quasielastic magnetic scattering signals from photons, a key signature for a QSI. Here, we use polarized neutron scattering experiments on single crystals of Ce2Zr2O7 to conclusively demonstrate the presence of magnetic excitations near zero energy at 50 mK in addition to signatures of spinons at higher energies. By comparing the energy (E), wave vector (Q), and polarization dependence of the magnetic excitations with theoretical calculations, we conclude that Ce2Zr2O7 is the first example of a dipolar-octupolar $\pi$ flux QSI with dominant dipolar Ising interactions, therefore identifying a microscopic Hamiltonian responsible for a QSL.</description>

      <title>Zeno physics of the Ising chain with symmetry-breaking boundary dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In few-qubit systems, the quantum Zeno effect arises when measurement occurs sufficiently frequently that the spins are unable to relax between measurements. This can compete with Hamiltonian terms, resulting in interesting relaxation processes which depend non-monotonically on the ratio of measurement rate to coherent oscillations. While Zeno physics for a single qubit is well-understood, an interesting open question is how the Zeno effect is modified by coupling the measured spin to a non-trivial bulk. In this work, we study the effect of coupling a one-dimensional transverse field Ising to a Zeno spin which lives at the boundary. We find that sharp singularities occur in the boundary relaxation dynamics, which can be tied to the emergence or destruction of edge modes that can be found analytically. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that the dynamical singularities are stable in the presence of integrability-breaking interactions.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement.
  We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</description>

      <title>Pymablock: an algorithm and a package for quasi-degenerate perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common technique in the study of complex quantum-mechanical systems is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian by using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. While the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation achieves this and constructs an effective Hamiltonian, its scaling is suboptimal, and implementing it efficiently is both challenging and error-prone. We introduce an algorithm for constructing an equivalent effective Hamiltonian as well as a Python package, Pymablock, that implements it. Our algorithm combines an optimal asymptotic scaling with a range of other improvements. The package supports numerical and analytical calculations of any order and it is designed to be interoperable with any other packages for specifying the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the package handles constructing a k.p model, analyses a superconducting qubit, and computes the low-energy spectrum of a large tight-binding model. We also compare its performance with reference calculations and demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nernst effect of high-mobility Weyl electrons in NdAlSi enhanced by a Fermi surface nesting instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric Nernst effect of solids converts heat flow to beneficial electronic voltages. Here, using a correlated topological semimetal with high carrier mobility $\mu$ in presence of magnetic fluctuations, we demonstrate an enhancement of the Nernst effect close to a magnetic phase transition. A magnetic instability in NdAlSi modifies the carrier relaxation time on 'hotspots' in momentum space, causing a strong band filling dependence of $\mu$. We quantitatively derive electronic band parameters from a novel two-band analysis of the Nernst effect $S_{xy}$, in good agreement with quantum oscillation measurements and band calculations. While the Nernst response of NdAlSi behaves much like conventional semimetals at high temperatures, an additional contribution $\Delta S_{xy}$ from electronic correlations appears just above the magnetic transition. Our work demonstrates the engineering of the relaxation time, or the momentum-dependent self energy, to generate a large Nernst response independent of a material's carrier density, i.e. for metals, semimetals, and semiconductors with large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka Ferromagnetism in $3 \times 3$ Arrays and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite onsite Coulomb repulsion and a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials, and was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a 2 \times 2 array of gated quantum dots. Atomically precise fabrication of dopant arrays in Si allows for engineering highly controllable systems with complex geometries. This makes dopant arrays a good candidate to study NF in different array geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical simulations done for $3 \times 3$ arrays and larger $N \times N $ arrays of quantum dots, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3 \times 3$ arrays, as well as in $N \times N $ arrays for one hole less than half-filling. The ratio of the Hubbard on-site repulsion U to hopping t that defines the onset of NF increases as N increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite U for large N. Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N \times N $ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops, the critical U/t for the onset of ferromagnetism decreases as the loop length increases. We show that this different dependence on size for loops and $N \times N $ arrays can be understood by a scaling argument. Our results show how analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining the quantum magnetism of small systems.</description>

      <title>The polarisation fluctuation length scale shaping the superconducting dome of SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting domes, ubiquitous across a variety of quantum materials, are often understood as a window favorite for pairing opened by the fluctuations of competing orders. Yet, a quantitative understanding of how such a window closes is missing. Here, we show that inelastic neutron scattering, by quantifying a length scale associated with polar fluctuations, $\ell_0$, addresses this issue. We find that the superconducting dome of strontium titanate definitely ends when $\ell_0$ vanishes. Moreover, the product of $\ell_0$ and the Fermi wavevector peaks close to the maximum critical temperature. Thus, this superconducting dome stems from the competition between the increase of the density of states and the unavoidable collapse of the quantum paraelectric phase, both induced by doping. The successful quantitative account of both the peak and the end of the superconducting dome implies a central role in the pairing mechanism played by the soft ferro-electric mode and its hybridisation with the acoustic branch. Such a scenario may also be at work in other quantum paraelectric materials, either bulk or interfaces.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Prethermalization in a Driven Quantum Spin Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and Crossover Phases of Topologically Ordered Graphene Zigzag Nanoribbons: Role of Localization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We computed the phase diagram of the zigzag graphene nanoribbons as a function of on-site repulsion, doping, and disorder strength. The topologically ordered phase undergoes topological phase transitions into crossover phases, which are new disordered phases with a nonuniversal topological entanglement entropy with significant variance. The topological order is destroyed by competition between localization effects and on-site repulsion. We found that strong on-site repulsion and/or doping weakens the nonlocal correlations between the opposite zigzag edges. In one of the crossover phases, both $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges and spin-charge separation were absent; however, charge-transfer correlations between the zigzag edges were possible. Another crossover phase contains $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges, but no charge transfer correlations. In low-doped zigzag ribbons the interplay between electron localization and on-site repulsion contributes to the spatial separation of quasi-degenerate gap-edge states and protects the charge fractionalization against quantum fluctuations. In all these effects, mixed chiral gap-edge states play an important role. The properties of nontopological strongly disordered and strongly repulsive phases are also observed. Each phase of the phase diagram has a different zigzag-edge structure. Additionally, we investigated the tunneling of solitonic fractional charges under an applied voltage between the zigzag edges of undoped topologically ordered zigzag ribbons, and found that it may lead to a zero-bias tunneling anomaly.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Modified-RPA Eliashberg Theory of the nu=1/2+1/2 Quantum Hall Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nu=1/2+1/2 quantum Hall bilayer has been previsously modeled using Chern-Simons-RPA-Eliashberg (CSRPAE) theory to describe pairing between the two layers. However, these approaches are troubled by a number of divergences and ambiguities. By using a "modified" RPA approximation to account for mass renormalization, we can work in a limit where the cyclotron frequency is taken to infinity, effectively projecting to a single Landau level. This, surprisingly, controls the important divergences and removes ambiguities found in prior attempts at CSRPAE. Examining BCS pairing of composite fermions we find that the angular momentum channel l=+1 dominates for all distances d between layers and at all frequency scales. Examining BCS pairing of composite fermion electrons in one layer with composite fermion holes in the opposite layer, we find the l=0 pairing channel dominates for all d and all frequencies. The strength of the pairing in these two different descriptions of the same phase of matter is found to be almost identical. This agrees well with our understanding that these are two different but dual descriptions of the same phase of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of topological insulators induced by correlation effects is one of the main issues of modern condensed matter physics. An intriguing example of the correlated topological insulators is a magnetic Chern insulator induced by a noncoplanar multiple-Q magnetic order. Although the realization of the magnetic Chern insulator has been studied in the classical limit of the Kondo lattice model, research on the magnetic Chern insulator in the original Kondo lattice model is limited. Here, we investigate the possibility of the many-body Chern insulator with the noncoplanar triple-Q magnetic order in the Kondo lattice model on a triangular lattice. Using the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method, we reveal that the triple-Q magnetic order becomes a ground state at quarter filling in an intermediate Kondo coupling region. We also show that the many-body Chern number is quantized to one in the triple-Q magnetic ordered phase utilizing the polarization operators. Our results provide a pathway for the realization of the many-body Chern insulator in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of a Strange Metal in a Quantum Superconductor to Metal Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments with nanopatterned thin films revealed an unusual quantum superconductor to metal phase transition (QSMT) with a linear in temperature resistivity. In contrast, most known examples of such transitions and standard theoretical considerations predict a temperature-independent sheet resistance of order $R_Q = \frac{\hbar}{e^2}$. We propose an effective theory of a disordered superconductor which features a QSMT with robust $T$ linear resistivity at the critical point. The crucial ingredient in our model is spatial disorder in the pairing interaction. Such random pairing mirrors the emergent phase disorder seen in a recent mean field study of a microscopic $d$-wave superconductor subject to potential disorder. We also make the prediction that in such systems the diamagnetic susceptibility diverges as $\log\frac{\Lambda}{T}$, which starkly differs from the power law divergence in standard XY transitions.</description>

Abstract: Planckian behavior has been recently observed in La1.76Sr0.24CuO4 at the pseudogap critical point. The Planckian behavior takes place in an intriguing quantum metallic state at a quantum critical point. Here, the Planckian behavior was simulated with an energy-independent (or flat) and weakly temperature-dependent electron-boson spectral density (EBSD) function by using a generalized Allen's (Shulga's) formula. We obtained various optical quantities from the flat EBSD function, such as the optical scattering rate, the optical effective mass, and the optical conductivity. These quantities are well fitted with the recently observed Planckian behavior. Fermi-liquid behavior was also simulated with an energy-linear and temperature-independent EBSD function. The EBSD functions agree well with the overall doping- and temperature-dependent trends of the EBSD function obtained from the optically measured spectra of cuprate systems, which can be crucial for understanding the microscopic electron-pairing mechanism for high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Neutron Scattering Studies on the High-$T_c$ Superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at Ambient Pressure</title>

Abstract: After several decades of studies of high-temperature superconductivity, there is no compelling theory for the mechanism yet; however, the spin fluctuations have been widely believed to play a crucial role in forming the superconducting Cooper pairs. The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity near 80 K in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure provides a new platform to elucidate the origins of high-temperature superconductivity. We perform elastic and inelastic neutron scattering studies on a polycrystalline sample of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ at ambient pressure. No magnetic order can be identified down to 10 K. The absence of long-range magnetic order in neutron diffraction measurements may be ascribed to the smallness of the magnetic moment. However, we observe a weak flat spin-fluctuation signal at $\sim$ 45 meV in the inelastic scattering spectra. The observed spin excitations could be interpreted as a result of strong interlayer and weak intralayer magnetic couplings for stripe-type antiferromagnetic orders. Our results provide crucial information on the spin dynamics and are thus important for understanding the superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>From Architectures to Applications: A Review of Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>
