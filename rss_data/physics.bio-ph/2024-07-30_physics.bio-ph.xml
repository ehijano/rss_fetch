      <title>New Theoretical Insights Unraveling Color Pattern in the Flowers of Passiflora incarnata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The change in the color pattern of the petals of Passiflora incarnata is studied using the chaos theory in the form of logistic maps and plotted using the corresponding bifurcation diagram. Based on a colorful inspection of the beginning of violet-colored dots along the filament of the flower's bud stage and the emergence of alternating bands of violet and white color in the matured bloom, it is possible to deduce that a two-degree model for polynomial mapping can be used to study color oscillations in the flower.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction and adaptation-development-evolution relation in evolved biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life systems are complex and hierarchical, with diverse components at different scales, yet they sustain themselves, grow, and evolve over time. How can a theory of such complex biological states be developed? Here we note that for a hierarchical biological system to be robust, it must achieve consistency between micro-scale (e.g. molecular) and macro-scale (e.g. cellular) phenomena. This allows for a universal theory of adaptive change in cells based on biological robustness and consistency between cellular growth and molecular replication. Here, we show how adaptive changes in high-dimensional phenotypes (biological states) are constrained to low-dimensional space, leading to the derivation of a macroscopic law for cellular states. The theory is then extended to evolution, leading to proportionality between evolutionary and environmental responses, as well as proportionality between phenotypic variances due to noise and due to genetic changes. The universality of the results across several models and experiments is demonstrated. Then, by further extending the theory of evolutionary dimensional reduction to multicellular systems, the relationship between multicellular development and evolution, in particular the developmental hourglass, is demonstrated. Finally, the possibility of collapse of dimensional reduction under nutrient limitation is discussed.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates emerging from protein chain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers. The cellular functions of the resulting membraneless organelles are closely linked to their physical properties over a wide range of length- and timescales: From the nanosecond dynamics of individual molecules and their interactions, to the microsecond translational diffusion of molecules in the condensates, to their viscoelastic properties at the mesoscopic scale. However, it has remained unclear how to quantitatively link these properties across scales. Here we address this question by combining single-molecule fluorescence, correlation spectroscopy, microrheology, and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on different condensates that are formed by complex coacervation and span about two orders of magnitude in viscosity and their dynamics at the molecular scale. Remarkably, we find that the absolute timescale of protein chain dynamics in the dense phases can be quantitatively and accurately related to translational diffusion and condensate viscosities by Rouse theory of polymer solutions including entanglement. The simulations indicate that the observed wide range of dynamics arises from different contact lifetimes between amino acid residues, which in the mean-field description of the polymer model cause differences in the friction acting on the chains. These results suggest that remarkably simple physical principles can relate the mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates to their dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Progression of Cancerous Tumors in Mice: A Machine and Deep Learning Intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study explores Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered modeling to predict the evolution of cancer tumor cells in mice under different forms of treatment. The AI models are analyzed against varying ambient and systemic parameters, e.g. drug dosage, volume of the cancer cell mass, and time taken to destroy the cancer cell mass. The data required for the analysis have been synthetically extracted from plots available in both published and unpublished literature (primarily using a Matlab architecture called "Grabit"), that are then statistically standardized around the same baseline for comparison. Three forms of treatment are considered - saline (multiple concentrations used), magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) and fluorodeoxyglycose iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mNP-FDGs) - analyzed using three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilinear Regression (MLR), and a Deep Learning (DL) module, the Adaptive Neural Network (ANN). The AI models are trained on 60-80% data, the rest used for validation. Assessed over all three forms of treatment, ANN consistently outperforms other predictive models. Our models predict mNP-FDG as the most potent treatment regime that kills the cancerous tumor completely in ca 13 days from the start of treatment. The models can be generalized to other forms of cancer treatment regimens.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cancer Stem Cell Markers Distribution:A Hypergraph Analysis Across Organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyse the distribution of cancer stem cell markers (CSCMs) across various cancer-affected organs using hypergraphs. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a crucial role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. By employing hypergraphs, we model the relationships between CSCM locations and cancerous organs, providing a comprehensive representation of these interactions. Initially, we utilised an unweighted incidence matrix and its Markov transition matrices to gain a dynamic perspective on CSCM distributions. This method allows us to observe how these markers spread and influence cancer progression in a dynamical context. By calculating mutual information for each node and hyperedge, our analysis uncovers complex interaction patterns between CSCMs and organs, highlighting the critical roles of certain markers in cancer progression and metastasis. Our approach offers a detailed representation of cancer stem cell networks, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms driving cancer heterogeneity and metastasis. By integrating hypergraph theory with cancer biology, this study provides valuable insights for developing targeted cancer therapies.</description>

      <title>Laser patterned diamond electrodes for adhesion and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to form diamond electrodes on insulating polycrystalline diamond substrates using single-step laser patterning, and the use of the electrodes as a substrate that supports the adhesion and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is demonstrated. Laser induced graphitisation results in a conductive amorphous carbon surface, rich in oxygen and nitrogen terminations. This results in an electrode with a high specific capacitance of 182 uF/cm2, a wide water window of 3.25 V, and a low electrochemical impedance of 129 Ohms/cm2 at 1 kHz. The electrodes surface exhibited a good level of biocompatibility with hMSCs, supporting cell adhesion and proliferation. The cells cultured on the electrode displayed significant elongation and alignment along the direction of the laser patterned microgrooves. Because of its favourable electrochemical performance and biocompatibility, the laser-patterned diamond electrodes create a potential for a versatile platform in stem cell therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Criticality enhances the reinforcement of disordered networks by rigid inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of biological materials are spatially heterogeneous. Typical tissues are made up of a spanning fibrous extracellular matrix in which various inclusions, such as living cells, are embedded. While the influence of inclusions on the stiffness of common elastic materials such as rubber has been studied for decades and can be understood in terms of the volume fraction and shape of inclusions, the same is not true for disordered filamentous and fibrous networks. Recent work has shown that, in isolation, such networks exhibit unusual viscoelastic behavior indicative of an underlying mechanical phase transition controlled by network connectivity and strain. How this behavior is modified when inclusions are present is unclear. Here, we present a theoretical and computational study of the influence of rigid inclusions on the mechanics of disordered elastic networks near the connectivity-controlled central force rigidity transition. Combining scaling theory and coarse-grained simulations, we predict and confirm an anomalously strong dependence of the composite stiffness on inclusion volume fraction, beyond that seen in ordinary composites. This stiffening exceeds the well-established volume fraction-dependent stiffening expected in conventional composites, e.g., as an elastic analogue of the classic volume fraction dependent increase in the viscosity of liquids first identified by Einstein. We show that this enhancement is a consequence of the interplay between inter-particle spacing and an emergent correlation length, leading to an effective finite-size scaling imposed by the presence of inclusions. We outline the expected scaling of the shear modulus and strain fluctuations with the inclusion volume fraction and network connectivity, confirm these predictions in simulations, and discuss potential experimental tests and implications for our predictions in real systems.</description>

      <title>Cell Sorting in an Active Nematic Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mixture of extensile and contractile cells using a vertex model extended to include active nematic stresses. The two cell populations phase separate over time. While phase separation strengthens monotonically with an increasing magnitude of contractile activity, the dependence on extensile activity is non-monotonic, so that sufficiently high values reduce the extent of sorting. We interpret this by showing that extensile activity renders the system motile, enabling cells to undergo neighbour exchanges. Contractile cells that come into contact as a result are then more likely to stay connected due to an effective attraction arising from contractile activity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Brain's Dynamic Response to Targeted Stimulation using Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models of brain activity have been instrumental in testing hypothesized mechanisms underlying brain dynamics against experimental datasets. Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain dynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain-stimulation techniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts from dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in such experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those that dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss: (i) the targeted experimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain to novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous dynamics; and (ii) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms using physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight integration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative modeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain dynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings.</description>

      <title>Julian Hirniak, an early proponent of periodic chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present and discuss the work and scientific legacy of Julian Hirniak, the Ukrainian chemist and physicist who published two articles in 1908 and 1911 about periodic chemical reactions. Over the last 110+ years, his theoretical work has often been cited favorably in connection with Alfred Lotka's theoretical model of an oscillating reaction system. Other authors have pointed out thermodynamic problems in Hirniak's reaction scheme. Based on English translations of his 1908 Ukrainian and 1911 German articles, we show that Hirniak's claim (that a cycle of inter-conversions of three chemical isomers in a closed reaction vessel can show damped periodic behavior) violates the \textit{Principle of Detailed Balance} (i.e., the Second Law of Thermodynamics), and that Hirniak was aware of this Principle. We also discuss his results in relation to Lotka's first model of damped oscillations in an open system of chemical reactions involving an auto-catalytic reaction operating far from equilibrium. Taking hints from both Hirniak and Lotka, we show that the mundane case of a kinase enzyme catalyzing the phosphorylation of a sugar can satisfy Hirniak's conditions for damped oscillations to its steady state flux (i.e., the Michaelis--Menten rate law), but that the oscillations are so highly damped as to be unobservable. Finally, we examine historical and factual misunderstandings related to Julian Hirniak and his publications.</description>

      <title>How do particles with complex interactions self-assemble?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In living cells, proteins self-assemble into large functional structures based on specific interactions between molecularly complex patches. Due to this complexity, protein self-assembly results from a competition between a large number of distinct interaction energies, of the order of one per pair of patches. Current self-assembly models however typically ignore this aspect, and the principles by which it determines the large-scale structure of protein assemblies are largely unknown. Here, we use Monte-Carlo simulations and machine learning to start to unravel these principles. We observe that despite widespread geometrical frustration, aggregates of particles with complex interactions fall within only a few categories that often display high degrees of spatial order, including crystals, fibers, and oligomers. We then successfully identify the most relevant aspect of the interaction complexity in predicting these outcomes, namely the particles' ability to form periodic structures. Our results provide a first extensive characterization of the rich design space associated with identical particles with complex interactions, and could inspire engineered self-assembling nanoobjects as well as help understand the emergence of robust functional protein structures.</description>

      <title>Restriction-induced time-dependent transcytolemmal water exchange: Revisiting the K\"arger exchange model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The K\"arger model and its derivatives have been widely used to incorporate transcytolemmal water exchange rate, an essential characteristic of living cells, into analyses of diffusion MRI (dMRI) signals from tissues. The K\"arger model consists of two homogeneous exchanging components coupled by an exchange rate constant and assumes measurements are made with sufficiently long diffusion time and slow water exchange. Despite successful applications, it remains unclear whether these assumptions are generally valid for practical dMRI sequences and biological tissues. In particular, barrier-induced restrictions to diffusion produce inhomogeneous magnetization distributions in relatively large-sized compartments such as cancer cells, violating the above assumptions. The effects of this inhomogeneity are usually overlooked. We performed computer simulations to quantify how restriction effects, which in images produce edge enhancements at compartment boundaries, influence different variants of the K\"arger-model. The results show that the edge enhancement effect will produce larger, time-dependent estimates of exchange rates in e.g., tumors with relatively large cell sizes (&gt;10 {\mu}m), resulting in overestimations of water exchange as previously reported. Moreover, stronger diffusion gradients, longer diffusion gradient durations, and larger cell sizes, all cause more pronounced edge enhancement effects. This helps us to better understand the feasibility of the K\"arger model in estimating water exchange in different tissue types and provides useful guidance on signal acquisition methods that may mitigate the edge enhancement effect. This work also indicates the need to correct the overestimated transcytolemmal water exchange rates obtained assuming the K\"arger-model.</description>
