      <title>InsectSet459: an open dataset of insect sounds for bioacoustic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic recognition of insect sound could help us understand changing biodiversity trends around the world -- but insect sounds are challenging to recognize even for deep learning. We present a new dataset comprised of 26399 audio files, from 459 species of Orthoptera and Cicadidae. It is the first large-scale dataset of insect sound that is easily applicable for developing novel deep-learning methods. Its recordings were made with a variety of audio recorders using varying sample rates to capture the extremely broad range of frequencies that insects produce. We benchmark performance with two state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers, demonstrating good performance but also significant room for improvement in acoustic insect classification. This dataset can serve as a realistic test case for implementing insect monitoring workflows, and as a challenging basis for the development of audio representation methods that can handle highly variable frequencies and/or sample rates.</description>

      <title>PANDORA: Diffusion Policy Learning for Dexterous Robotic Piano Playing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PANDORA, a novel diffusion-based policy learning framework designed specifically for dexterous robotic piano performance. Our approach employs a conditional U-Net architecture enhanced with FiLM-based global conditioning, which iteratively denoises noisy action sequences into smooth, high-dimensional trajectories. To achieve precise key execution coupled with expressive musical performance, we design a composite reward function that integrates task-specific accuracy, audio fidelity, and high-level semantic feedback from a large language model (LLM) oracle. The LLM oracle assesses musical expressiveness and stylistic nuances, enabling dynamic, hand-specific reward adjustments. Further augmented by a residual inverse-kinematics refinement policy, PANDORA achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ROBOPIANIST environment, significantly outperforming baselines in both precision and expressiveness. Ablation studies validate the critical contributions of diffusion-based denoising and LLM-driven semantic feedback in enhancing robotic musicianship.

      <title>Shushing! Let's Imagine an Authentic Speech from the Silent Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-guided speech generation aims to produce authentic speech from facial appearance or lip motions without relying on auditory signals, offering significant potential for applications such as dubbing in filmmaking and assisting individuals with aphonia. Despite recent progress, existing methods struggle to achieve unified cross-modal alignment across semantics, timbre, and emotional prosody from visual cues, prompting us to propose Consistent Video-to-Speech (CV2S) as an extended task to enhance cross-modal consistency. To tackle emerging challenges, we introduce ImaginTalk, a novel cross-modal diffusion framework that generates faithful speech using only visual input, operating within a discrete space. Specifically, we propose a discrete lip aligner that predicts discrete speech tokens from lip videos to capture semantic information, while an error detector identifies misaligned tokens, which are subsequently refined through masked language modeling with BERT. To further enhance the expressiveness of the generated speech, we develop a style diffusion transformer equipped with a face-style adapter that adaptively customizes identity and prosody dynamics across both the channel and temporal dimensions while ensuring synchronization with lip-aware semantic features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImaginTalk can generate high-fidelity speech with more accurate semantic details and greater expressiveness in timbre and emotion compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Demos are shown at our project page: https://imagintalk.github.io.</description>

      <title>Communication Access Real-Time Translation Through Collaborative Correction of Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication access real-time translation (CART) is an essential accessibility service for d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals, but the cost and scarcity of trained personnel limit its availability. While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) offers a cheap and scalable alternative, transcription errors can lead to serious accessibility issues. Real-time correction of ASR by non-professionals presents an under-explored CART workflow that addresses these limitations. We conducted a user study with 75 participants to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of this workflow. Complementary, we held focus groups with 25 DHH individuals to identify acceptable accuracy levels and factors affecting the accessibility of real-time captioning. Results suggest that collaborative editing can improve transcription accuracy to the extent that DHH users rate it positively regarding understandability. Focus groups also showed that human effort to improve captioning is highly valued, supporting a semi-automated approach as an alternative to stand-alone ASR and traditional CART services.</description>

      <title>Evaluating ASR Confidence Scores for Automated Error Detection in User-Assisted Correction Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), transcription errors persist and require manual correction. Confidence scores, which indicate the certainty of ASR results, could assist users in identifying and correcting errors. This study evaluates the reliability of confidence scores for error detection through a comprehensive analysis of end-to-end ASR models and a user study with 36 participants. The results show that while confidence scores correlate with transcription accuracy, their error detection performance is limited. Classifiers frequently miss errors or generate many false positives, undermining their practical utility. Confidence-based error detection neither improved correction efficiency nor was perceived as helpful by participants. These findings highlight the limitations of confidence scores and the need for more sophisticated approaches to improve user interaction and explainability of ASR results.</description>

      <title>Solla: Towards a Speech-Oriented LLM That Hears Acoustic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable ability to process not only text but also multimodal inputs such as speech and audio. However, most existing models primarily focus on analyzing input signals using text instructions, overlooking scenarios in which speech instructions and audio are mixed and serve as inputs to the model. To address these challenges, we introduce Solla, a novel framework designed to understand speech-based questions and hear the acoustic context concurrently. Solla incorporates an audio tagging module to effectively identify and represent audio events, as well as an ASR-assisted prediction method to improve comprehension of spoken content. To rigorously evaluate Solla and other publicly available models, we propose a new benchmark dataset called SA-Eval, which includes three tasks: audio event classification, audio captioning, and audio question answering. SA-Eval has diverse speech instruction with various speaking styles, encompassing two difficulty levels, easy and hard, to capture the range of real-world acoustic conditions. Experimental results show that Solla performs on par with or outperforms baseline models on both the easy and hard test sets, underscoring its effectiveness in jointly understanding speech and audio.</description>

      <title>ChildMandarin: A Comprehensive Mandarin Speech Dataset for Young Children Aged 3-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have advanced significantly with models like Whisper, Conformer, and self-supervised frameworks such as Wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT. However, developing robust ASR models for young children's speech remains challenging due to differences in pronunciation, tone, and pace compared to adult speech. In this paper, we introduce a new Mandarin speech dataset focused on children aged 3 to 5, addressing the scarcity of resources in this area. The dataset comprises 41.25 hours of speech with carefully crafted manual transcriptions, collected from 397 speakers across various provinces in China, with balanced gender representation. We provide a comprehensive analysis of speaker demographics, speech duration distribution and geographic coverage. Additionally, we evaluate ASR performance on models trained from scratch, such as Conformer, as well as fine-tuned pre-trained models like HuBERT and Whisper, where fine-tuning demonstrates significant performance improvements. Furthermore, we assess speaker verification (SV) on our dataset, showing that, despite the challenges posed by the unique vocal characteristics of young children, the dataset effectively supports both ASR and SV tasks. This dataset is a valuable contribution to Mandarin child speech research. The dataset is now open-source and freely available for all academic purposes on https://github.com/flageval-baai/ChildMandarin.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

      <title>MoonCast: High-Quality Zero-Shot Podcast Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis have achieved notable success in generating high-quality short utterances for individual speakers. However, these systems still face challenges when extending their capabilities to long, multi-speaker, and spontaneous dialogues, typical of real-world scenarios such as podcasts. These limitations arise from two primary challenges: 1) long speech: podcasts typically span several minutes, exceeding the upper limit of most existing work; 2) spontaneity: podcasts are marked by their spontaneous, oral nature, which sharply contrasts with formal, written contexts; existing works often fall short in capturing this spontaneity. In this paper, we propose MoonCast, a solution for high-quality zero-shot podcast generation, aiming to synthesize natural podcast-style speech from text-only sources (e.g., stories, technical reports, news in TXT, PDF, or Web URL formats) using the voices of unseen speakers. To generate long audio, we adopt a long-context language model-based audio modeling approach utilizing large-scale long-context speech data. To enhance spontaneity, we utilize a podcast generation module to generate scripts with spontaneous details, which have been empirically shown to be as crucial as the text-to-speech modeling itself. Experiments demonstrate that MoonCast outperforms baselines, with particularly notable improvements in spontaneity and coherence.</description>
