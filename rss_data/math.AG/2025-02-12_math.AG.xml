      <title>Smooth Calabi-Yau varieties with large index and Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A normal variety $X$ is called Calabi-Yau if $K_X \sim_{\mathbb Q} 0$. The index of $X$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ so that $m K_X \sim 0$. We construct smooth, projective Calabi-Yau varieties in every dimension with doubly exponentially growing index, which we conjecture to be maximal in every dimension. We also construct smooth, projective Calabi-Yau varieties with extreme topological invariants; namely, their Euler characteristics and the sums of their Betti numbers grow doubly exponentially. These are conjecturally extremal in every dimension. The varieties we construct are known in small dimensions but we believe them to be new in general. This work builds off of the singular Calabi-Yau varieties found by Esser, Totaro, and Wang in arXiv:2209.04597.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami on broken lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analogy to Nekrasov's theory of gauge origami on intersecting branes, we introduce the gauge origami moduli space on broken lines. We realize this moduli space as a Quot scheme parametrising zero-dimensional quotients of a torsion sheaf on two intersecting affine lines, and describe it as a moduli space of quiver representations. We construct a virtual fundamental class and virtual structure sheaf, by which we define $K$-theoretic invariants. We compute its associated partition function for all ranks, and show that it reproduces the generating series of equivariant $\chi_{y}$-genus when the moduli space is smooth. Finally, we relate our partition function with the virtual invariants of the Quot schemes of the affine plane and Nekrasov's partition function.</description>

      <title>A note on multisecants of the Kummer variety of Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07197v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $C$ is a smooth projective curve and $\mathfrak{d}$ is a $\mathfrak{g}^{n}_{2n}$ on $C$, then we obtain a rational map $\mathrm{Sym}^{n}(C)\dashrightarrow\mathfrak{d}$ whose fibers can be related in an interesting way to Gunning multisecants of the Kummer variety of $JC$. This generalizes previous work done by the first author with Codogni and Salvati Manni.</description>

      <title>Obstructions for Morin and fold maps: Stiefel-Whitney classes and Euler characteristics of singularity loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a singularity type $\eta$, let the $\eta$-avoiding number of an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ be the lowest $k$ for which there is a map $M\to\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ without $\eta$ type singular points. For instance, the case of $\eta=\Sigma^1$ is the case of immersions, which has been extensively studied in the case of real projective spaces. In this paper we study the $\eta$-avoiding number for other singularity types. Our results come in two levels: first we give an abstract reasoning that a non-zero cohomology class is supported on the singularity locus $\eta(f)$, proving that $\eta(f)$ cannot be empty. Second, we interpret this obstruction as a non-zero invariant of the singularity locus $\eta(f)$ for generic $f$. The main technique that we employ is Sullivan's Stiefel-Whitney classes, which are mod 2, real analogues of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson (CSM) classes. We introduce the Segre-Stiefel-Whitney classes of a singularity ${\rm s}^{\rm sw}_\eta$ whose lowest degree term is the mod 2 Thom polynomial of $\eta$. Using these techniques we compute some universal formulas for the Euler characteristic of a singularity locus.</description>

      <title>Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes in the point of view of Obstruction Theory and Lipschitz framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Chern and Grothendieck, Chern's characteristic class theory has made significant progress. In particular with regard to the classes of singular varieties. Conjectured by Grothendieck and Deligne and demonstrated by MacPherson, Chern classes of singular varieties have been defined in several ways, such as using polar varieties, Lagrangian theory... However, the initial definition using obstruction theory, due to Marie-H\'el\`ene Schwartz, has been forgotten. Despite the simple ideas that enabled the obstruction definition, their implementation using Whitney stratifications requires delicate and technical constructions. In the present article, we show that in the Lipschitz framework, the ideas of Marie-H\'el\`ene Schwartz lead to a simplified definition and construction of Chern classes of complex analytic varieties.</description>

      <title>The Difference Kapranov Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper creates a link between \textit{Tropical Geometry} and \textit{Difference Algebra}. The main result is a difference version of \textit{Kapranov's Theorem}. In this theorem, we extend Kapranov's Theorem to the case of a Laurent difference polynomial with coefficients from a multiplicative valued difference field, where the residue field is an algebraically closed field with a generic automorphism (ACFA). A result of this paper that plays a critical role in the proof of the Difference Kapranov Theorem is a difference version of \textit{Newton's Lemma}.</description>

Abstract: A formula for the full nonperturbative topological string free energy was recently proposed by Hattab and Palti \cite{HP24a}. In this work, we extend their result to the refined topological string theory. We demonstrate that the proposed formula for the full nonperturbative refined topological string free energy correctly reproduces the trans-series structure of the refined topological string and captures the Stokes automorphisms associated with its resurgent properties.</description>

      <title>The Batyrev-Manin conjecture for DM stacks II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a sequel to a paper by the authors. We formulate a prototype of a Batyrev-Manin type conjecture for DM stacks in positive characteristic with emphasis on the wild case. The key to doing so is the notion of sectoroids, which plays a role similar to the role played by sectors in characteristic zero. We also check some compatibilities of the proposed prototype and see how it reduces to special cases. In the course of formulating the prototype, we introduce a new type of height functions, which is more general and flexible than the one we considered in the preceding paper. Examples of this new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. In appendices, we generalize construction of a moduli stack by Tonini-Yasuda and construct a morphism between stacks of twisted arcs. These results are closely related to the main text, but also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An Elliptic Curve Based Solution to the Perspective-Three-Point Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Perspective-Three-Point Problem (P3P) is solved by first focusing on determining the directions of the lines through pairs of control points, relative to the camera, rather than the distances from the camera to the control points. The analysis of this produces an efficient, accurate and reasonably simple P3P solver, which is compared with a state-of-the-art P3P solver, "Lambda Twist." Both methods depend on the accurate computation of a single root of a cubic polynomial. They have been implemented and tested for a wide range of control-point triangles, and under certain reasonable restrictions, the new method is noticably more accurate than Lambda Twist, though it is slower. However, the principal value of the present work is not in introducing yet another P3P solver, but lies rather in the discovery of an intimate connection between the P3P problem and a special family of elliptic curves that includes curves utilized in cryptography. This holds the potential for further advances in a number of directions. To make this connection, an interesting spherical analogue of an ancient "sliding" problem is stated and solved.</description>

      <title>Next-to-minimal weight of toric codes defined over hypersimplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toric codes are a type of evaluation codes introduced by J.P. Hansen in 2000. They are produced by evaluating (a vector space composed by) polynomials at the points of $(\mathbb{F}_q^*)^s$, the monomials of these polynomials being related to a certain polytope. Toric codes related to hypersimplices are the result of the evaluation of a vector space of square-free homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$. The dimension and minimum distance of toric codes related to hypersimplices have been determined by Jaramillo et al. in 2021. The next-to-minimal weight in the case $d = 1$ has been determined by Jaramillo-Velez et al. in 2023. In this work we use tools from Gr\"obner basis theory to determine the next-to-minimal weight of these codes for $d$ such that $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d &lt; s$.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of Fano 3-folds and log Bott vanishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kawakami and the author showed that a projective variety with an int-amplified endomorphism of degree invertible in the base field satisfies Bott vanishing. That was a new way to analyze which varieties have nontrivial endomorphisms. In this paper, we extend that result to a logarithmic version of Bott vanishing for an endomorphism with a totally invariant divisor.
  We apply this to Fano 3-folds. Meng-Zhang-Zhong showed that the only smooth complex Fano 3-folds that admit an int-amplified endomorphism are the toric ones. Also, Achinger-Witaszek-Zdanowicz showed that the only smooth complex Fano 3-folds that are images of toric varieties are the toric ones. Using log Bott vanishing, we reprove both results and extend them to characteristic p, for morphisms of degree prime to p.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the orbifold fundamental group $\pi_1^{\rm orb}(X,\Delta)$ of a Calabi--Yau pair $(X,\Delta)$ with log canonical singularities. We conjecture that the orbifold fundamental group $\pi_1^{\rm orb}(X,\Delta)$ of a $n$-dimensional log Calabi--Yau pair admits a normal solvable subgroup of rank at most $2n$ and index at most $c(n)$. We prove this conjecture in the case that $n=2$. More precisely, for a log Calabi--Yau surface pair $(X,\Delta)$ we show that $\pi_1^{\rm orb}(X,\Delta)$ is the extension of a nilpotent group of length at most $2$ and rank at most $4$ by a finite group of order at most $7200$. We also show that the bounds on the nilpotency length, rank, and order of the finite group quotient in this result are sharp. Finally, we provide some necessary criteria for a log Calabi--Yau surface $(X,\Delta)$ to have an infinite, or a non virtually abelian orbifold fundamental group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting tangency as a limit of two transverse intersections, we obtain a concrete formula to enumerate smooth degree d plane curves tangent to a given line at multiple points with arbitrary order of tangency. One nodal curves with multiple tangencies of any order are enumerated. Also, one cuspidal curves, that are tangent to first order to a given line at multiple points, are enumerated.
  We also present a new way to enumerate curves with one node; it is interpreted as a degeneration of a curve tangent to a given line. That method is extended to enumerate curves with two nodes, and also curves with one tacnode are enumerated. In the final part of the paper, it is shown how this idea can be applied in the setting of stable maps and perform a concrete computation to enumerate rational curves with first order tangency. A large number of low degree cases have been worked out explicitly.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first generalize the K-theoretic Ancestor-Descendant (AD) correspondence in \cite{perm7} to allow arbitrary permutative inputs. With this version of AD correspondence, we reconstruct K-theoretical descendant $g=0$ invariants, and $g=1$ invariants with point target space, from $1$-point invariants of the corresponding genus. In the appendix, we show that the graph of big $\mathcal{J}$ function also forms a Lagrangian cone in the permutation equivariant setting.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with a higher-order nonsymplectic automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe Baily-Borel, toroidal, and geometric -- using the KSBA stable pairs -- compactifications of some moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with a nonsymplectic automorphism of order $3$ and $4$ for which the fixed locus of the automorphism contains a curve of genus $\ge2$. For order $3$, we treat all the maximal-dimensional such families. We show that the toroidal and the KSBA compactifications in these cases admit simple descriptions in terms of certain $ADE$ root lattices.</description>

      <title>$K_2$-regularity and normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relationship between $K$-regularity and regularity of schemes, proving two results in this direction. First, we show that $K_2$-regular affine algebras over fields of characteristic zero are normal. Second, we improve on Vorst's $K$-regularity bound in the case of local complete intersections; this is related to recent work on higher du Bois singularities.</description>

      <title>Generators of the algebraic symplectic bordism ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic symplectic cobordism is the universal symplectically oriented cohomology theory for schemes, represented by the motivic commutative ring spectrum $\text{MSp}$ constructed by Panin and Walter. The graded algebraic diagonal $\text{MSp}^*$ of the coefficient ring of $\text{MSp}$ is unknown. Through a symplectic version of the Pontryagin-Thom construction, one can associate any symplectic variety $X$ with a symplectic class $[X]_\text{MSp}$ in $\text{MSp}^{-\text{dim} X}$. Still, the problem in using these classes to study the ring $\text{MSp}^*$ is the paucity of non-trivial examples of symplectic varieties. We modify this construction to obtain elements in $\text{MSp}^*$ from a large family of varieties that are not symplectic but carry a certain "symplectic twist". Then, using a strategy relying on the Adams spectral sequence for $\text{MSp}$, we find a criterion to select generators among these classes, after taking a completion along the motivic Hopf map $\eta$.</description>

      <title>Second moments and the bias conjecture for the family of cubic pencils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a 1-parametric family $E_k$ of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and a prime $p$, consider the second moment sum $M_{2,p}(E_k)=\sum_{k \in \mathbb{F}_p} a_{k,p}^2$, where $a_{k,p}=p+1-\#E_k(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Inspired by Rosen and Silverman's proof of Nagao conjecture which relates the first moment of a rational elliptic surface to the rank of Mordell-Weil group of the corresponding elliptic curve, S. J. Miller initiated the study of the asymptotic expansion of $M_{2,p}(E_k)=p^2+O(p^{3/2})$ (which by the work of Deligne and Michel has cohomological interpretation). He conjectured that, similar to the first moment case, the largest lower-order term that does not average to 0 has a negative bias.
  In this paper, we provide an explicit formula for the second moment $M_{2,p}(\mathcal{E}_{U})$ of $$
  \mathcal{E}_{U}:y^2=P(x)U+Q(x), $$ where $\textrm{deg } P(x), \textrm{deg } Q(x)\leq 3$. For a generic choice of polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ this formula is expressed in terms of the point count of a certain genus two curve. As an application, we prove that the Bias conjecture holds for the pencil of the cubics $\mathcal{E}_U$.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch Mirror Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate here the deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch loop and chain mirrors where the original manifolds are defined in the same weighted projective space. We show that the deformations are equivalent by two methods. First, we map directly the two models to each other and show that the deformations are the same for $79$ "Good" models, but not for the $77$ "Bad" ones. We then investigate the orbifold of the mirror pair by the maximal symmetry group and show that the number of deformations is the same and that they are almost the same, i.e., the first four exponents of the deformations are identical.</description>

      <title>Singular leaning coefficients and efficiency in learning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular learning models with non-positive Fisher information matrices include neural networks, reduced-rank regression, Boltzmann machines, normal mixture models, and others. These models have been widely used in the development of learning machines. However, theoretical analysis is still in its early stages. In this paper, we examine learning coefficients, which indicate the general learning efficiency of deep linear learning models and three-layer neural network models with ReLU units. Finally, we extend the results to include the case of the Softmax function.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Species and Arithmetic Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though Joyal's species are known to categorify generating functions in enumerative combinatorics, they also categorify zeta functions in algebraic geometry. The reason is that any scheme $X$ of finite type over the integers gives a "zeta species" $Z_X$, and any species $F$ gives a Dirichlet series $\widehat{F}$, in such a way that $\widehat{Z}_X$ is the arithmetic zeta function of $X$, a well-known Dirichlet series that encodes the number of points of $X$ over each finite field. Specifically, a $Z_X$-structure on a finite set is a way of making that set into a semisimple commutative ring, say $k$, and then choosing a $k$-point of the scheme $X$. This is an elaboration of joint work with James Dolan.</description>
