      <title>Targeting Without Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the welfare-maximizing allocation of heterogeneous goods when monetary transfers are prohibited. Agents have private cardinal values, and the designer chooses a non-monetary mechanism subject to incentive compatibility and aggregate supply constraints. I characterize implementable allocations and give sufficient conditions under which the optimum coincides with a competitive equilibrium with equal incomes (CEEI). When these conditions fail, I characterize the optimum for two symmetric goods. I show that when narrow preference margins between goods predict greater need, the designer can sometimes benefit from distorting CEEI by offering a menu containing pure options and bundles.</description>

      <title>Social Learning with Endogenous Information and the Countervailing Effects of Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People learn about opportunities and actions by observing the experiences of their friends. We model how homophily -- the tendency to associate with similar others -- affects both the endogenous quality and diversity of the information accessible to decision makers. Homophily provides higher-quality information, since observing the payoffs of another person is more informative the more similar that person is to the decision maker. However, homophily can lead people to take actions that generate less information. We show how network connectivity influences the tradeoff between the endogenous quantity and quality of information. Although homophily hampers learning in sparse networks, it enhances learning in sufficiently dense networks.</description>

      <title>The Domain of RSD Characterization by Efficiency, Symmetry, and Strategy-Proofness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of $n$ individuals with strict preferences over $m$ indivisible objects, the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) mechanism is a method for allocating objects to individuals in a way that is efficient, fair, and incentive-compatible. A random order of individuals is first drawn, and each individual, following this order, selects their most preferred available object. The procedure continues until either all objects have been assigned or all individuals have received an object.
  RSD is widely recognized for its application in fair allocation problems involving indivisible goods, such as school placements and housing assignments. Despite its extensive use, a comprehensive axiomatic characterization has remained incomplete. For the balanced case $n=m=3$, Bogomolnaia and Moulin have shown that RSD is uniquely characterized by Ex-Post Efficiency, Equal Treatment of Equals, and Strategy-Proofness. The possibility of extending this characterization to larger markets had been a long-standing open question, which Basteck and Ehlers recently answered in the negative for all markets with $n,m\geq5$.
  This work completes the picture by identifying exactly for which pairs $\left(n,m\right)$ these three axioms uniquely characterize the RSD mechanism and for which pairs they admit multiple mechanisms. In the latter cases, we construct explicit alternatives satisfying the axioms and examine whether augmenting the set of axioms could rule out these alternatives.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hurwicz: Incentive Compatibility under Informational Decentralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving incentive compatibility under informational decentralization is impossible within the class of direct and revelation-equivalent mechanisms typically studied in economics and computer science. We show that these impossibility results are conditional by identifying a narrow class of non-revelation-equivalent mechanisms that sustain enforcement by inferring preferences indirectly through parallel, uncorrelatable games.</description>

      <title>"Sail Fast, Then Wait" in First-come, First-served Port Queues: Information Sharing for Sustainable Shipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a novel class of queueing game to explain a common practice in cargo shipping "Sail Fast, Then Wait" (SFTW), and demonstrates that resolving information asymmetry among ships can deconcentrate port arrival times. We formulate a competitive navigating environment as an incomplete information game where players strategically decide their arrival time within heterogeneous feasible sets under First-Come, First-Served port policy. Our results show that in incomplete information settings, SFTW emerges as the unique symmetric equilibrium. Conversely, under complete information, the set of equilibria expands, allowing for slower and more environmentally friendly actions without compromising service order. We further quantitatively evaluate the effect of information enrichment based on empirical data. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of technologies enabling ships to infer others' private information can effectively reduce SFTW and enable more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable operations.</description>

      <title>The relationship between R&amp;D spillovers and regional innovation: Licensing patents through royalties and the Stackelberg duopoly with subgame perfect Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper examines the effect of R&amp;D spillovers on regional innovation in Greece over the 2002-2010 period. The approach taken goes beyond a regional knowledge production function and draws possible explanations from a more extensive pool of R&amp;D related and regional structural variables. Having employed game theory techniques in order to describe the licensing of the patents through royalties and derived the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium under a Stackelberg duopoly, the results obtained accord with findings of previous studies when it comes R&amp;D expenditure related variables and further suggest that the role of highly-qualified employment is instrumental in promoting regional innovation. The results also suggest the benefits of synergies between R&amp;D personnel in manufacturing and other measures of highly-qualified employment as well as R&amp;D expenditure of the public sector and employment in manufacturing business R&amp;D for regional innovation.</description>

      <title>Simple and Robust Quality Disclosure: The Power of Quantile Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality information on online platforms is often conveyed through simple, percentile-based badges and tiers that remain stable across different market environments. Motivated by this empirical evidence, we study robust quality disclosure in a market where a platform commits to a public disclosure policy mapping the seller's product quality into a signal, and the seller subsequently sets a downstream monopoly price. Buyers have heterogeneous private types and valuations that are linear in quality. We evaluate a disclosure policy via a minimax competitive ratio: its worst-case revenue relative to the Bayesian-optimal disclosure-and-pricing benchmark, uniformly over all prior quality distributions, type distributions, and admissible valuations.
  Our main results provide a sharp theoretical justification for quantile-partition disclosure. For K-quantile partition policies, we fully characterize the robust optimum: the optimal worst-case ratio is pinned down by a one-dimensional fixed-point equation and the optimal thresholds follow a backward recursion. We also give an explicit formula for the robust ratio of any quantile partition as a simple "max-over-bins" expression, which explains why the robust-optimal partition allocates finer resolution to upper quantiles and yields tight guarantees such as 1 + 1/K for uniform percentile buckets. In contrast, we show a robustness limit for finite-signal monotone (quality-threshold) partitions, which cannot beat a factor-2 approximation. Technically, our analysis reduces the robust quality disclosure to a robust disclosure design program by establishing a tight functional characterization of all feasible indirect revenue functions.</description>

      <title>Shapley-Scarf Markets with Objective Indifferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Top trading cycles with fixed tie-breaking (TTC) has been suggested to deal with indifferences in object allocation problems. Unfortunately, under general indifferences, TTC is neither Pareto efficient nor group strategy-proof. Furthermore, it may not select an allocation in the core of the market, even when the core is non-empty. However, when indifferences are agreed upon by all agents (``objective indifferences''), TTC maintains Pareto efficiency, group strategy-proofness, and core selection. Further, we characterize objective indifferences as the most general setting where TTC maintains these properties.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Monopolies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply marginal analysis \`a la Bulow and Roberts (1989) to characterize revenue-maximizing selling mechanisms for a multiproduct monopoly. We derive marginal revenue from price perturbations over arbitrary sets of bundles and show that optimal mechanisms admit no revenue-increasing perturbation for bundles with positive demand, nor revenue-decreasing perturbations for zero-demand bundles. For any symmetric two-dimensional type distribution under mild regularity, this analysis fully characterizes the optimal mechanism across independence, substitutability, and complementarity. For general type distributions and allocation spaces, our approach identifies bundles that must carry positive demand and provides conditions under which pure bundling or separate selling is suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Real Preferences Under Arbitrary Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether the goal is to analyze voting behavior, locate facilities, or recommend products, the problem of translating between (ordinal) rankings and (numerical) utilities arises naturally in many contexts. This task is commonly approached by representing both the individuals doing the ranking (voters) and the items to be ranked (alternatives) in a shared metric space, where ordinal preferences are translated into relationships between pairwise distances. Prior work has established that any collection of rankings with $n$ voters and $m$ alternatives (preference profile) can be embedded into $d$-dimensional Euclidean space for $d \geq \min\{n,m-1\}$ under the Euclidean norm and the Manhattan norm. We show that this holds for all $p$-norms and establish that any pair of rankings can be embedded into $R^2$ under arbitrary norms, significantly expanding the reach of spatial preference models.</description>

      <title>A multi-self model of self-punishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the choice of a decision maker (DM) who harms herself, by maximizing in each menu some distortion of her true preference, in which the first i alternatives are moved, in reverse order, to the bottom. This pattern has no empirical power, but it allows to define a degree of self-punishment, which measures the extent of the denial of pleasure adopted by the DM. We characterize irrational choices displaying the lowest degree of self-punishment, and we fully identify the preferences that explain the DM's picks by a minimal denial of pleasure. These datasets account for some well known selection biases, such as second-best procedures, and the handicapped avoidance. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the estimation of the degree of self-punishment of a choice are singled out. Moreover the linear orders whose harmful distortions justify choice data are partially elicited. Finally, we offer a simple characterization of the choice behavior that exhibits the highest degree of self-punishment, and we show that this subclass comprises almost all choices.</description>

      <title>Compromise by "multimatum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a solution and a mechanism for two-agent social choice problems with large (infinite) policy spaces. Our solution is an efficient compromise rule between the two agents, built on a common cardinalization of their preferences. Our mechanism, the multimatum, has the two players alternate in proposing sets of alternatives from which the other must choose. Our main result shows that the multimatum fully implements our compromise solution in subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.
  We demonstrate the power and versatility of this approach through applications to political economy, other-regarding preferences, and facility location.</description>
