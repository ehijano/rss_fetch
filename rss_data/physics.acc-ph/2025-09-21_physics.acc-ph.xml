      <title>Advancing 1D thermo-hydraulic tools for large cryogenic facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cryogenic Division at Fermilab develops large-scale cryogenic systems for particle accelerators and superconducting magnet test facilities. To support design and diagnostics, a Python-based code was created to calculate pressure drops in components such as valves and pipes. This paper presents recent enhancements to the code, including new heat transfer functions that improve the accuracy of thermal and hydraulic predictions. The first application models pressure and temperature changes in Proton Improvement Plant PIP-II relief pipes, aiding pipe sizing and protecting relief valves. The second example analyses heat load evolution in a pipe carrying sub-atmospheric helium, helping interpret temperature sensor data and understand gas return behavior to cold compressors. These improvements significantly expand the tool's capabilities, offering a practical resource for designing and troubleshooting cryogenic systems under dynamic thermal and flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of the HFVMTF Double-Bath Cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Field Vertical Magnet Test Facility (HFVMTF) at Fermilab is designed to test superconducting magnets up to 20 tons and 1.3 meters in diameter. Central to the facility is a double-bath superfluid helium cryostat reaching 1.8 K at 1.2 bar. Integrated with a 15 T superconducting dipole from LBNL, HFVMTF supports HTS cable testing for fusion applications. This paper presents the design and fabrication of the cryostat, with a focus on two complex components: the 2 K heat exchanger and the lambda plate. The heat exchanger thermally links sub-atmospheric and pressurized helium baths. The 1.4-meter lambda plate provides thermal isolation and structural support for over 20 tons under 1.3 bar pressure differential. Finite Element Analysis validated the vessel's integrity under maximum load conditions.</description>

      <title>Integration and commissioning plan of Full Flow Purifier at Muon Campus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Full Flow Purifier for Fermilab's Muon Campus uses a charcoal bed surrounded by a liquid nitrogen jacket to purify up to 240 g/s of helium gas. Fabrication by Ability Engineering Technology Inc. has been completed and the purifier delivered to Fermilab. It is the largest purifier to be used at Fermilab based on both capacity and size. A previous paper discussed the design of purifier for various operational conditions and horizontal shipping. The purifier is designed to withstand 5g force in vertical and 2g force in lateral and longitudinal directions. Transportation experience from vendor to Fermilab and within site is discussed. Integration of the purifier involved design and fabrication of a liquid nitrogen transfer line, regeneration system, and helium piping to connect it to Muon Campus cryogenic system. It also involved establishing electrical, instrumentation and controls connections to the system. Integration of the purifier is discussed in detail. The purifier is to be commissioned using up to 4 MYCOM helium compressors to supply helium and liquid nitrogen supplied by a 60,000-liter tank. Actual effectiveness of the 3-stream heat exchanger is to be estimated based on measured temperatures and flow rate. Impurity levels will be monitored at inlet and outlet of the purifier. Theoretical adsorption capacity of the purifier is calculated based on the measured temperatures and flowrates and is compared to actual adsorption capacity over time.</description>

      <title>A novel method of half-life determination for highly charged ions based on isochronous mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of the isomeric state in fully stripped 94Ru44+ ions has been measured using isochronous mass spectrometry (IMS) at the experimental Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe) of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). Previously, the isomeric lifetime was determined by analyzing the decay time points of individual decay events. In this paper, we present a novel approach to determine the isomeric lifetime based on the survival time of ions obtained from IMS. The survival lifetimes of the ground and isomeric states of 94Ru44+ were measured to be s and s in the laboratory, respectively. Given that the ground state of 94Ru44+ has a natural lifetime of approximately 75 min, its survival lifetime in the experimental setup was predominantly determined by the beam-loss lifetime, including interactions with residual gas in the storage ring and carbon foil of the detector. In contrast, the survival lifetime of 94mRu44+ was governed by its intrinsic nuclear lifetime and additional beam-loss effects. The nuclear decay lifetime of 94mRu44+ was extracted through differential survival lifetime analysis between ground and isomeric states, under the assumption that the beam-loss lifetimes for both quantum systems are identical. Using this novel methodology, the lifetime measured in the laboratory frame was s. After relativistic time-dilation corrections, the corresponding rest-frame half-life was calculated to be s. This result demonstrates excellent consistency with previous experimental results, validating the reliability of the new method. This method is suitable for determining half-lives of highly charged ions in the range of several tens of microseconds to milliseconds using IMS.</description>
