      <title>The Epigenetic Tapestry: A Review of DNA Methylation and Non-Coding RNA's Interplay with Genetic Threads, Weaving a Network Impacting Gene Expression and Disease Manifestations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of epigenetics has recently unveiled a dynamic landscape in which gene expression is not determined solely by genetic sequences but also by intricate regulatory mechanisms. This review examines the interactions between these regulatory mechanisms, including DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), that orchestrate gene expression fine-tuning for cellular homeostasis and the pathogenesis of a multitude of diseases. We explore long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and Fendrr, highlighting their role in protein regulation to ensure proper gene activation or silencing. Additionally, we explain the therapeutic potential of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-related microRNA 132, which has shown promise in treating chronic illnesses by restoring BDNF levels. Finally, this review covers the role of DNA methyltransferases and ncRNAs in cancer, focusing on how lncRNAs contribute to X chromosome inactivation and interact with chromatin-modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to reduce cancer cell aggressiveness. By amalgamating the wide array of research in this field, we aim to provide glimpses into the complex entangling of genetics and environment as they control gene expressions.</description>
