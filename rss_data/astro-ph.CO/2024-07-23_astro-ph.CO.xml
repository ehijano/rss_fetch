      <title>Effects of primordial fluctuations on relic neutrino simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decoupling, relic neutrinos traverse the evolving gravitational imhomogeneities along their trajectories. Once they turn non-relativistic, this results in a significant amplification of the anisotropies in the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Past studies have reconstructed the phase-space distribution of relic neutrinos from the local distribution of matter (accounting for the Milky Way halo and the surrounding large-scale structures), but have neglected the C$\nu$B anisotropies in the initial conditions of neutrino trajectories. Using our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework, we show that including these primordial fluctuations in the initial conditions can be important, as it produces similar effects on the abundance and anisotropies of the C$\nu$B as the inclusion of large-scale structures beyond the Milky Way halo. Interpretability of data from future C$\nu$B observatories like PTOLEMY therefore depends on correctly modelling these effects.</description>

      <title>Forecasts and Statistical Insights for Line Intensity Mapping Cross-Correlations: A Case Study with 21cm x [CII]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity mapping -- the large-scale mapping of selected spectral lines without resolving individual sources -- is quickly emerging as an efficient way to conduct large cosmological surveys. Multiple surveys covering a variety of lines (such as the hydrogen 21cm hyperfine line, CO rotational lines, and [CII] fine structure lines, among others) are either observing or will soon be online, promising a panchromatic view of our Universe over a broad redshift range. With multiple lines potentially covering the same volume, cross-correlations have become an attractive prospect, both for probing the underlying astrophysics and for mitigating observational systematics. For example, cross correlating 21cm and [CII] intensity maps during reionization could reveal the characteristic scale of ionized bubbles around the first galaxies, while simultaneously providing a convenient way to reduce independent foreground contaminants between the two surveys. However, many of the desirable properties of cross-correlations in principle emerge only under ideal conditions, such as infinite ensemble averages. In this paper, we construct an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing intensity mapping cross-correlations, enabling instrumental effects, foreground residuals, and analysis choices to be propagated through Monte Carlo simulations to a set of rigorous error properties, including error covariances, window functions, and full probability distributions for power spectrum estimates. We use this framework to critically examine the applicability of simplifying assumptions such as the independence and Gaussianity of power spectrum errors. As worked examples, we forecast the sensitivity of near-term and futuristic 21cm-[CII] cross-correlation measurements, providing recommendations for survey design.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Duet by Resonating Binary Black Holes with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage gravitational wave observations to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on axion-like particles (ALPs). This study investigates the resonant effects of ALPs with binary black hole systems, where their oscillatory nature induces time-dependent forces on the black holes. By employing a detailed Fisher matrix analysis, we not only probe a new parameter space for ALPs, characterized by their mass and decay constants, but also assess how these parameters affect gravitational waveforms during black hole mergers. Our approach is distinct as it does not assume interactions of ALPs with photons or nucleons. We demonstrate that as binary black holes spiral inward and lose energy, their orbital frequencies may resonate with those of ALPs, producing distinct oscillatory patterns in gravitational waves detectable by upcoming experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). This work broadens the potential of gravitational wave astronomy as a tool for dark matter searches, offering a promising avenue for studying elusive components of the universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on interacting dark energy models from the DESI BAO and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent results from the first year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full five-year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM for the IDE model with $Q=\beta H_0\rho_{\rm de}$ reaches the $3\sigma$ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with $Q\propto\rho_{\rm c}$, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient $\Gamma$. The IDE model with $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ yields $\beta=0.0003\pm 0.0011$, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy confronted with multiple CMB missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have played a significant role in understanding the nature of dark energy. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state, utilizing high-precision CMB data from multiple experiments. We begin by examining the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, a commonly used and recognized framework for describing the dark energy equation of state. We then explore the general Exponential parametrization, which incorporates CPL as its first-order approximation, and extensions of this parametrization that incorporate nonlinear terms. We constrain these scenarios using CMB data from various missions, including the Planck 2018 legacy release, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT), as well as combinations with low-redshift cosmological probes such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Pantheon sample. While the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology remains consistent within the 68\% confidence level, we observe that the extensions of the CPL parametrization are indistinguishable for Planck data. However, for ACT and SPT data, the inclusion of additional terms begins to reveal a peak in $w_{\rm a, DE}$ that was previously unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This could be tested via second-order GW signals in future observatories, for instance, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET. %. for sneutrino mass $m_{\phi} \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $\beta \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Strong Observational Support for the R_h=ct Timeline in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST's recent discovery of well-formed galaxies and supermassive black holes only a few hundred Myr after the big bang seriously challenges the timeline predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. Now, the latest identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at $z=6.71$, together with these earlier inconsistencies, makes the time compression problem in this model quite overwhelming. We consider the timeline associated with the formation and growth of PAH grains based on current astrophysical models and argue that their appearance at $z=6.71$ favors the structure formation history in $R_{\rm h}=ct$ rather than that of Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We estimate the time at which they must have started growing in each case, and then trace their history through various critical events, such as the end of the `dark ages,' the beginning of Pop III star formation, and the onset of reionization. Together, these three distinct discoveries by JWST, viz. high-$z$ galaxies, high-$z$ quasars and the surprisingly early appearance of PAHs, all paint a fully consistent picture in which the timeline in $\Lambda$CDM is overly compressed at $z\gtrsim 6$, while strongly supporting the expansion history in the early Universe predicted by $R_{\rm h}=ct$.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Tension Statistics using Neural Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When fits of the same physical model to two different datasets disagree, we call this tension. Several apparent tensions in cosmology have occupied researchers in recent years, and a number of different metrics have been proposed to quantify tension. Many of these metrics suffer from limiting assumptions, and correctly calibrating these is essential if we want to successfully determine whether discrepancies are significant. A commonly used metric of tension is the evidence ratio R. The statistic has been widely adopted by the community as a Bayesian way of quantifying tensions, however, it has a non-trivial dependence on the prior that is not always accounted for properly. We show that this can be calibrated out effectively with Neural Ratio Estimation. We demonstrate our proposed calibration technique with an analytic example, a toy example inspired by 21-cm cosmology, and with observations of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument~(DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey~(SDSS). We find no significant tension between DESI and SDSS.</description>

      <title>Probing the shape of the primordial curvature power spectrum and the energy scale of reheating with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) provides a unique opportunity to probe the early Universe, potentially encoding information about the primordial curvature power spectrum and the energy scale of reheating. Recent observations by collaborations such as NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, and CPTA have detected a stochastic common-spectrum signal, which may originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by primordial curvature perturbations during inflation. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that the NANOGrav signal is sourced by SIGWs and aim to constrain the shape of the primordial curvature power spectrum and the reheating energy scale using the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We model the primordial curvature power spectrum with a lognormal form and focus on the case where the equation of state during reheating is $w=1/6$, corresponding to an inflaton potential $V(\phi) \sim \phi^{14/5}$. Employing Bayesian inference, we obtain posterior distributions for the lognormal power spectrum parameters and the reheating temperature. Our results indicate a narrow peak in the primordial power spectrum ($\Delta &lt; 0.001$ at 90\% confidence) and a lower bound on the reheating temperature ($T_{\rm rh} \geq 0.1 {\rm GeV}$), consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints. The best-fit SIGW energy density spectrum exhibits a distinct turning point around $f \sim 10^{-8.1}\,{\rm Hz}$, corresponding to the transition from reheating to the radiation-dominated era. This feature, combined with the sharp high-frequency decrease due to the narrow primordial power spectrum peak, offers a unique signature for probing early Universe properties.</description>

      <title>Cosmological measurement of the gravitational constant $G$ using the CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have provided numerous new observations with increasing precision that have led to the era of precision cosmology. The exquisite quality of these observations opens new possibilities towards measuring fundamental constants with good precision and at scales which are complementary to the laboratory ones. In particular, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization spectra contain a wealth quantity of information, well beyond the basic cosmological parameters. In this paper, we update the precision on a cosmological determination of $G$ by using the latest Planck data release (PR4) in combination with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 1. We demonstrate a precision of $2.1\%$, corresponding to a $\sim25\%$ improvement compared to the literature. This measurement is compatible with laboratory ones within one standard deviation. Finally, we show that this cosmological measurement of $G$ is robust against several assumptions made on the cosmological model, in particular when considering a non-standard dark energy fluid or non-flat models.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the initial clustering of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) beyond a Poisson distribution can efficiently enhance the matter power spectrum, and thus the halo mass function. As a result, the population of initially clustered SMPBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^9M_\odot$ and the fraction of energy density $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-3}$ (consistent with current constraints on SMPBHs) has the potential to naturally explain high-redshift massive galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled gravity as a physically viable fit to DESI 2024 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the DESI collaboration have presented an indication for dynamical dark energy, when adopting the $(w_0,w_a)$ parametrization of the equation of state. The associated posterior constraints imply a crossing of the phantom divide. The latter, however, has profound theoretical implications because not all models can do so without developing incurable instabilities. Simple quintessence models of dark energy, for instance, would be ruled out if such a crossing is confirmed. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the equation of state, and confirm that crossing of the phantom divide is required by the DESI BAO data. We then explore the theory space of Horndeski gravity employing a reconstruction method based on the effective field theory of dark energy, and show that for most of the models it is still difficult to safely cross the divide. We identify non-minimal coupling to gravity as the key modification which sustains a stable phantom crossing in the general Horndeski theory space and fits DESI observations. Guided by these insights, we propose the \textit{Thawing Gravity} model which has the same number of parameters as $w_0w_a$CDM and naturally realizes non-minimal coupling when dark energy becomes non-negligible. \textit{Thawing Gravity} improves the fit over $\Lambda$CDM for DESI BAO, CMB as well as type Ia Supernovae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that an exactly static black hole event horizon cannot be embedded in a time-dependent geometry. Forcing it to do so results in a naked null singularity at the would-be horizon. Therefore, since the universe is expanding, black holes must couple to the cosmological expansion, which was suggested as the growth mechanism for supermassive black holes in galaxies, with implications for the dark energy puzzle.</description>

      <title>Dark matter core creation depends on the timing of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study feedback-driven cold dark matter core creation in the EDGE suite of radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxy simulations. Understanding this process is crucial when using observed dwarf galaxies to constrain the particle nature of dark matter. While previous studies have shown the stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio $(M_{\star} / M_{200})$ determines the extent of core creation, we find that in low-mass dwarfs there is a crucial additional effect, namely the timing of star formation relative to reionisation. Sustained post-reionisation star formation decreases central dark matter density through potential fluctuations; conversely, pre-reionisation star formation is too short-lived to have such an effect. In fact, large stellar masses accrued prior to reionisation are a strong indicator of early collapse, and therefore indicative of an increased central dark matter density. We parameterise this differentiated effect by considering $M_{\star,\mathrm{post}}/M_{\star,\mathrm{pre}}$, where the numerator and denominator represent the amount of star formation after and before $z\sim6.5$, respectively. Our study covers the halo mass range $10^9 &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{10} M_\odot$ (stellar masses between $10^4 &lt; M_{\star} &lt; 10^8 M_\odot$), spanning both ultra-faint and classical dwarfs. In this regime, $M_{\star,\mathrm{post}}/M_{\star,\mathrm{pre}}$ correlates almost perfectly with the central dark matter density at $z=0$, even when including simulations with a substantially different variant of feedback and cooling. We provide fitting formulae to describe the newfound dependence.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter Production through the Bubble Expansion Mechanism: The Boosting Role of Non-Renormalizable Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bubble Expansion mechanism for the production of scalar dark matter during a first-order phase transition in the early Universe. Seeking for a dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field undergoing the transition. The resulting relic abundance is shown to display a strong dependence on the Lorentz boost factor associated to the bubble wall motion, with this dependence becoming more significant the higher the dimension of the non-renormalizable interaction. This allows for observational compatibility across a wide range of dark matter masses and transition temperatures, typically excluded in renormalizable scenarios. For a transition around the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is also within the reach of future detectors.</description>

      <title>The Non-Relativistic Effective Field Theory Of Dark Matter-Electron Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic excitations in atomic, molecular, and crystal targets are at the forefront of the ongoing search for light, sub-GeV dark matter (DM). In many light DM-electron interactions the energy and momentum deposited is much smaller than the electron mass, motivating a non-relativistic (NR) description of the electron. Thus, for any target, light DM-electron phenomenology relies on understanding the interactions between the DM and electron in the NR limit. In this work we derive the NR effective field theory (EFT) of general DM-electron interactions from a top-down perspective, starting from general high-energy DM-electron interaction Lagrangians. This provides an explicit connection between high-energy theories and their low-energy phenomenology in electron excitation based experiments. Furthermore, we derive Feynman rules for the DM-electron NR EFT, allowing observables to be computed diagrammatically, which can systematically explain the presence of in-medium screening effects in general DM models. We use these Feynman rules to compute absorption, scattering, and dark Thomson scattering rates for a wide variety of high-energy DM models.</description>

      <title>Implications of Sgr A$^\ast$ on the $\gamma$-rays searches of Bino Dark Matter with $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of dark matter density spike around the Milky Way's supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sgr A$^*$, in probing the Bino-dominated neutralino dark matter (DM) $\tilde \chi_1^0$ within the MSSM, which typically produces relatively faint signals in the conventional DM halos. In particular, we explore the indirect search prospects of sub-TeV Bino-Higgsino and Bino-Wino-Higgsino DM in the MSSM, consistent with the supersymmetric predictions required to explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Typical over-abundance of Bino DM is ameliorated with slepton and/or Wino coannihilations. The lightest neutralino, thus, may be associated with a compressed supersymmetric particle spectrum, which, in general, is difficult to probe at conventional LHC searches. Similarly, for a rather tiny Higgsino mixing, $\tilde \chi_1^0$ does not offer much prospect to assess its predictions at dark matter direct detection searches. Accommodating the inclusive effects of density spike, here, we present the requisite boost factor to facilitate $\gamma-$ray searches of Bino-dominated DM in the MSSM, especially focusing on the Fermi-LAT and HESS observations.</description>

      <title>How does the velocity anisotropy of halo stars, dark matter and satellite galaxies depend on host halo properties?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mass ($M_{200}$) and concentration ($c_{200}$) dependencies of the velocity anisotropy ($\beta$) profiles for different components in the dark matter halo, including halo stars, dark matter and subhalos, using systems from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Beyond a critical radius, $\beta$ becomes more radial with the increase of $M_{200}$, reflecting more prominent radial accretion around massive halos. The critical radius is $r\sim r_s$, $0.3~r_s$ and $r_s$ for halo stars, dark matter and subhalos, with $r_s$ the scale radius of host halos. This dependence on $M_{200}$ is the strongest for subhalos, and the weakest for halo stars. In central regions, $\beta$ of halo stars and dark matter particles gets more isotropic with the increase of $M_{200}$ in TNG300 due to baryons. By contrast, $\beta$ of dark matter from the dark matter only TNG300-Dark run shows much weaker dependence on $M_{200}$ within $r_s$. Dark matter in TNG300 is slightly more isotropic than in TNG300-Dark at $0.2~r_s&lt;r&lt;10~r_s$ and $\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\odot&lt;13.8$. Halo stars and dark matter also become more radial with the increase in $c_{200}$, at fixed $M_{200}$. Halo stars are more radial than the $\beta$ profile of dark matter by approximately a constant beyond $r_s$. Dark matter particles are more radial than subhalos. The differences can be understood as subhalos on more radial orbits are easier to get stripped, contributing more stars and dark matter to the diffuse components. We provide a fitting formula to the difference between the $\beta$ of halo stars and of dark matter at $r&gt;r_s$ as $\beta_\mathrm{star}-\beta_\mathrm{DM}=(-0.028 \pm 0.008)\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\odot + (0.690\pm0.010)$.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS I. The Discovery and Star Forming Properties of Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization at $6.5 &lt; z &lt; 18$ with PEARLS and Public JWST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present in this paper the discovery, properties, and a catalog of 1165 high redshift $6.5 &lt; z &lt; 18$ galaxies found in deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the GTO PEARLS survey combined with data from JWST public fields. We describe our bespoke homogeneous reduction process and our analysis of these areas including the NEP, CEERS, GLASS, NGDEEP, JADES, and ERO SMACS-0723 fields with over 214 arcmin$^{2}$ imaged to depths of $\sim 30$ mag. We describe our rigorous methods for identifying these galaxies, involving the use of Lyman-break strength, detection significance criteria, visual inspection, and integrated photometric redshifts probability distributions predominately at high redshift. Our sample is a robust and highly pure collection of distant galaxies from which we also remove brown dwarf stars, and calculate completeness and contamination from simulations. We include a summary of the basic properties of these $z &gt; 6.5$ galaxies, including their redshift distributions, UV absolute magnitudes, and star formation rates. Our study of these young galaxies reveals a wide range of stellar population properties as seen in their colors and SED fits which we compare to stellar population models, indicating a range of star formation histories, dust, AGN and/or nebular emission. We find a strong trend exists between stellar mass and $(U-V)$ color, as well as the existence of the `main-sequence' of star formation for galaxies as early as $z \sim 12$. This indicates that stellar mass, or an underlying variable correlating with stellar mass, is driving galaxy formation, in agreement with simulation predictions. We also discover ultra-high redshift candidates at $z &gt; 12$ in our sample and describe their properties. Finally, we note a significant observed excess of galaxies compared to models at $z &gt; 12$, revealing a tension between predictions and our observations.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal collapse and the diversity of galactic rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotation curves of spiral galaxies exhibit a great diversity that challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. Previous studies showed that in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with a cross section per unit mass of $\sigma/m\approx{\cal O}(1)~{\rm cm^2/g}$, the predicted dark matter central densities are a good match to the observed densities in galaxies. In this work, we explore a regime with a larger cross section of $\sigma/m\approx20-40~{\rm cm^2/g}$ in dwarf galactic halos. We will show that such strong dark matter self-interactions can further amplify the diversity of halo densities inherited from their assembly history. High concentration halos can enter the gravothermal collapse phase within $10~{\rm Gyr}$, resulting in a high density, while low concentration ones remain in the expansion phase and have a low density. We fit the rotation curves of $14$ representative low surface brightness galaxies and demonstrate how the large range of observed central densities are naturally accommodated in the strong SIDM regime of $\sigma/m\approx20-40~{\rm cm^2/g}$. Galaxies that are outliers in the previous studies due to their high halo central densities, are no longer outliers in this SIDM regime as their halos would be in the collapse phase. For galaxies with a low density, the SIDM fits are robust to the variation of the cross section. Our findings open up a new window for testing gravothermal collapse, the unique signature of strong dark matter self-interactions, and exploring broad SIDM model space.</description>

      <title>Dipole Cosmology in $f(Q)$-gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$-gravity allows for the presence of a perfect fluid with a tilted velocity in the Kantowski-Sachs geometry. In this dipole model, we consider an ideal gas and we investigate the evolution of the physical parameters. The tilt parameter is constrained by the nonlinear function $f(Q)$ through the non-diagonal equations of the field equations. We find that the dynamics always reduce to the vacuum solutions of STEGR. This includes the Kasner universe, when no cosmological term is introduced by the $f(Q)$ function, and the isotropic de Sitter universe, where $f\left( Q\right) $ plays the role of the cosmological constant. In the extreme tilt limit, the universe is consistently anisotropic and accelerated. However, the final solution matches that of STEGR.</description>

      <title>Systematic effects induced by half-wave plate differential optical load and TES nonlinearity for LiteBIRD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiteBIRD, a forthcoming satellite mission, aims to measure the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) across the entire sky. The experiment will employ three telescopes, Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers and rotating Half-Wave Plates (HWPs) at cryogenic temperatures to ensure high sensitivity and systematic effects mitigation. This study is focused on the Mid- and High-Frequency Telescopes (MHFT), which will use rotating metal mesh HWPs. We investigate how power variations due to HWP differential emissivity and transmittance combine with TES nonlinear responsivity, resulting in an effective instrumental polarization. We present the results of simulations for the current HWP design, modeling the TES deviation from linearity as a second-order response. We quantify the level of acceptable residual nonlinearity assuming the mission requirement on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $\delta r &lt; 0.001$. Moreover, we provide an accuracy requirement on the measurement of TES responsivity nonlinearity level for MHFT channels. Lastly, we present possible mitigation methods that will be developed in future studies.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects on Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the TNG100 run of the IllustrisTNG project, we characterize the environment of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs) across varying scales, from their associated dark matter halos to their distribution within the broader cosmic structure. We find no significant differences in the halo concentration index $c_{200}$ between LSBGs and their High Surface Brightness (HSBGs) counterparts, with LSBGs residing in halos with higher spin parameter $\lambda$ and slightly more spherical shapes than HSBGs. LSBGs show a stronger alignment between the dark and stellar angular momentum vectors than their high surface brightness counterparts. The relative abundance of LSBGs within groups and clusters displays a central deficit, hinting at potential destruction upon reaching these core regions. Studying the density field, we find a preference for rotation-dominated LSBGs to reside in low-density environments, while dispersion-dominated LSBGs thrive in high-density regions where galaxy interactions govern their evolution, an observation corroborated by our analysis of the two-point correlation function $\xi (r)$. Our examination of the cosmic web reveals no significant differences in the distance to the closest large-scale structure, barring a few exceptions. This suggests a limited impact of large-scale spatial distribution on mechanisms driving LSBG evolution. All together, we conclude that the halo vicinity and local environment at the scale of galaxy clusters, where mechanisms such as galaxy mergers and tidal stripping, as well as stellar and gas accretion take place, is the most likely environment that favour the emergence of LSBGs with different morphologies, mostly driven by the presence or absence of important local interaction phenomena.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on FLRW, Bianchi type I and V brane models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the compatibility of Covariant Extrinsic Gravity (CEG) with current cosmological observations. We employ the chi-square statistic and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the FLRW and Bianchi type-I and V brane models to the latest datasets, including Hubble, Pantheon+ Supernova samples, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the structure growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$. Parameters for FLRW universe consist $\left(\Omega^{\text{(b)}}_0, \Omega^{\text{(cd)}}_0, \Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0, H_0, \gamma, \sigma_8\right)$, while for the Bianchi model are $\left(\Omega^{\text{(b)}}_0, \Omega^{\text{(cd)}}_0, \Omega^{{(\beta)}}_0, H_0, \gamma, \Omega^{(\theta)}_0, \sigma_8\right)$. We determine the best values for cosmological parameters. For the FLRW model, these values depend on the sign of $\gamma$: $\gamma &gt; 0$ yields $\gamma =0.00008^{+0.00015}_{-0.00011}$, and $\Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0=0.014^{+0.024}_{-0.022}$ and $\gamma &lt; 0$ leads to $\gamma =-0.0226^{+0.0054}_{-0.0062}$, and $\Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0=0.023^{+0.039}_{-0.041}$. In both cases $\Omega^{\text{(k)}}_0&gt;0$ represents a closed universe. Similarly, for the Bianchi type-V brane model, the parameter values vary with the sign of $\gamma$, resulting in $\gamma = 0.00084^{+0.00019}_{-0.00021}$, $\Omega^{(\beta)}_0 =0.0258^{+0.0052}_{-0.0063} $, and $\Omega^{\theta}_0(\times 10^{-5} ) = 4.19^{+0.67}_{-0.75}$ (as with the density parameter of stiff matter) for $\gamma &gt; 0$, and $\gamma = -0.00107^{+0.00019}_{-0.00020}$, $\Omega^{(\beta)}_0 = 0.0259^{+0.0050}_{-0.0062} $, and $\Omega^{\theta}_0(\times 10^{-5} ) = 4.17^{+0.91}_{-0.98}$ for $\gamma &lt; 0$. In both cases $\Omega^{(\beta)}_0&gt;0$, which represents the Bianchi type-V, because in the Bianchi type-I, $\beta=0$. Utilizing these obtained best values, we analyze the behavior of key cosmological parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a coupled phantom dark-energy cosmological model in which the coupling term between a phantom scalar field with an exponential potential and a pressureless dark-matter fluid is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm. Using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems, complemented by numerical solutions of the evolution equations, we study the late-time behavior of our model. We show that contrary to the uncoupled scenario, the coupled phantom model admits accelerated scaling solutions. However, they do not correspond to a final state of the universe's evolution and, therefore, cannot be used to solve the cosmological coincidence problem. Furthermore, we show that, for certain coupling parameter values, the total equation-of-state parameter's asymptotic behavior is significantly changed when compared to the uncoupled scenario, allowing for solutions less phantom even for steeper potentials of the phantom scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the velocity and acceleration fluctuations and distributions of cold dark matter particles that involve long-range gravitational interactions. For comparison, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo random elastic collisions involving a short-range interaction, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant that follows a Maxwellian-Boltzmann distribution. Long-range gravity requires a broad size of haloes to be formed. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller haloes to form larger haloes, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small- to large-scale haloes at a constant rate of $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. The velocity fluctuation involves a critical velocity $u_c$, and the acceleration fluctuation involves a critical acceleration $a_c$. The two critical quantities are related by the rate of the energy cascade as $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -{a_c u_c/[2(3\pi)^2]}$, where the factor $3\pi$ is from the angle of incidence during the merging. With a typical velocity dispersion of $u_c$ on the order of 500km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is found to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ at $z=0$ with a redshift dependence $a_{c} \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ that is greater at higher redshift. This suggests that the critical acceleration $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0 \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The redshift evolution of $a_0 \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ is also proposed and validated by this work, Magneticum, and EAGLE simulations. Future work on the high-redshift Tully-Fisher relation will provide more insight. A notable coincidence of dark energy density $\rho_{\Lambda} \propto {a_{c0}^{2}/G}$ might suggest an entropic origin of dark energy from the fluctuations of dark matter accelerations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves: prospects for probing intermediate-mass black holes in galaxy lenses with global minima image</title>

Abstract: This work studies microlensing effects in strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to global minima images in galaxy-scale lenses. We find that stellar microlenses alone are unable to introduce noticeable wave effects in the global minima GW signals at strong lensing magnification $(\mu)&lt;50$ with match value between unlensed and lensed GW signals being above ${\sim}99.5\%$ in ${\sim}90\%$ of systems implying that GW signals corresponding to global minima can be treated as reference signal to determine the amount of microlensing in other strongly lensed counterparts. Since the stellar microlenses introduce negligible wave effects in global minima, they can be used to probe the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) lenses in the galaxy lens. We show that the presence of an IMBH lens with mass in the range $[50,10^3] {\rm M_\odot}$ such that the global minima lies within five Einstein radius of it, the microlensing effects at $f&lt;10^2$Hz are mainly determined by the IMBH lens for $\mu&lt;50$. Assuming that a typical strong lensing magnification of 3.8 and high enough signal-to-noise ratio (in the range ${\simeq}[10, 30]$) to detect the microlensing effect in GW signals corresponding to global minima, with non-detection of IMBH-led microlensing effects in ${\simeq}15\:({\simeq}150)$ lensed GW signals, we can rule out dark matter fraction $&gt;10\%\:(&gt;1\%)$ made of IMBH population inside galaxy lenses with mass values $&gt;150 {\rm M_\odot}$ with ${\sim}90\%$ confidence. Although we have specifically used IMBHs as an example, the same analysis applies to any subhalo (or compact objects) with lensing masses (i.e., the total mass inside Einstein radius) satisfying the above criterion.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearity-Free prediction of the growth-rate $f\sigma_8$ using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth-rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ of the large-scale structure of the Universe is an important dynamic probe of gravity that can be used to test for deviations from General Relativity. However, for galaxy surveys to extract this key quantity from cosmological observations, two important assumptions have to be made: i) a fiducial cosmological model, typically taken to be the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and ii) the modeling of the observed power spectrum, especially at non-linear scales, which is particularly dangerous as most models used in the literature are phenomenological at best. In this work, we propose a novel approach involving convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on the Quijote N-body simulations, to predict $f\sigma_8(z)$ directly and without assuming a model for the non-linear part of the power spectrum, thus avoiding the second of the assumptions above. This could serve as an initial step towards the future development of a method for parameter inference in Stage IV surveys. We find that the predictions for the value of $f\sigma_8$ from the CNN are in excellent agreement with the fiducial values since they outperform a maximum likelihood analysis and the CNN trained on the power spectrum. Therefore, we find that the CNN reconstructions provide a viable alternative to avoid the theoretical modeling of the non-linearities at small scales when extracting the growth rate.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Induced Gravitational Waves from a Smooth Crossover beyond Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial fluctuations can be affected by the modification of the sound speed $c^2_{\rm s}$ and the equation of state parameter $w$ once the curvature fluctuations reenter the cosmological horizon. That softening can also significantly boost the production of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) at the mass scale where the softening arises. In this work, we consider a hypothetical softening of $w$ and $c^2_{\rm s}$ caused by a smooth crossover beyond Standard Model theories, for what we numerically compute the secondary induced GW considering the case of a flat scale-invariant power spectrum. We find that if the amplitude of the power spectrum is sufficiently large, the characteristic feature of the GW signal caused by the smooth crossover can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave interferometers and differentiated from the pure radiation case. At the same time, depending on the mass scale where the crossover occurs, such a scenario can have compatibility with PBHs being all the dark matter when $\mathcal{A} \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, with a mass function very sharply peaked around the horizon mass scale of the minimum of the sound speed. Our results show that the GW signal can be used to resolve the existing degeneracy of sharply peaked mass function caused by peaked power spectrums and broad ones in the presence of softenings of $w$ and $c^2_{\rm s}$.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Hubble tension in Yukawa cosmology?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Yukawa cosmology, a recent discovery revealed a relationship between baryonic matter and the dark sector. The relation is described by the parameter {\alpha} and the long-range interaction parameter {\lambda} - an intrinsic property of the graviton. Applying the uncertainty relation to the graviton raises a compelling question: Is there a quantum mechanical limit to the measurement precision of the Hubble constant (H0)? We argue that the uncertainty relation for the graviton wavelength {\lambda} can be used to explain a running of H0 with redshift. We show that the uncertainty in time has an inverse correlation with the value of the Hubble constant. That means that the measurement of the Hubble constant is intrinsically linked to length scales (redshift) and is connected to the uncertainty in time. On cosmological scales, we found that the uncertainty in time is related to the look-back time quantity. For measurements with a high redshift value, there is more uncertainty in time, which leads to a smaller value for the Hubble constant. Conversely, there is less uncertainty in time for local measurements with a smaller redshift value, resulting in a higher value for the Hubble constant. Therefore, due to the uncertainty relation, the Hubble tension is believed to arise from fundamental limitations inherent in cosmological measurements. Finally, our findings indicate that the mass of the graviton fluctuates with specific scales, suggesting a possible mass-varying mechanism for the graviton.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Tensions: Localising Missing Physics through Consistency Checks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\Lambda$CDM tensions are by definition model dependent; one sees anomalies through the prism of $\Lambda$CDM. Thus, progress towards tension resolution necessitates checking the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model to localise missing physics either in redshift or scale. Since the Universe is dynamical and redshift is a proxy for time, it is imperative to first perform consistency checks involving redshift, then consistency checks involving scale, as the next steps to settle the ``systematics versus new physics" debate and foster informed model building. We present a review of the hierarchy of assumptions underlying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and comment on whether relaxing them can address the tensions. We focus on the lowest lying fruit of identifying missing physics through the identification of redshift dependent $\Lambda$CDM model fitting parameters. We highlight recent progress made on ${S_8:= \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}}$ tension and elucidate how similar progress can be made on $H_0$ tension. Our discussions indicate that $H_0$ tension, equivalently a redshift dependent $H_0$, and a redshift dependent $S_8$ imply a problem with background $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>How open is the asteroid-mass primordial black hole window?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can make up all of the dark matter (DM) if their mass, $m$, is in the so-called 'asteroid-mass window', $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{22} \, {\rm g}$. Observational constraints on the abundance of PBHs are usually calculated assuming they all have the same mass, however this is unlikely to be a good approximation. PBHs formed from the collapse of large density perturbations during radiation domination are expected to have an extended mass function (MF), due to the effects of critical collapse. The PBH MF is often assumed to be lognormal, however it has recently been shown that other functions are a better fit to numerically calculated MFs. We recalculate both current and potential future constraints for these improved fitting functions. We find that for current constraints the asteroid-mass window narrows, but remains open (i.e. all of the DM can be in the form of PBHs) unless the PBH MF is wider than expected. Future evaporation and microlensing constraints may together exclude all of the DM being in PBHs, depending on the width of the PBH MF and also the shape of its low and high mass tails.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Warm Dark Matter Models through 21cm Line Intensity Mapping: A Convolutional Neural Network Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the mock 21cm maps from the post-reionization epoch to show that the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter and warm dark matter (WDM) model can be distinguished for WDM particle masses $m_{FD}&lt;3$\,keV, under the assumption of thermal production of WDM following the Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution. We demonstrate that the CNN is a potent tool in distinguishing the dark matter masses, highlighting its sensitivity to the subtle differences in the 21cm maps produced by varying dark matter masses. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to encompass different WDM production mechanisms, recognizing that the dark matter production mechanism in the early Universe is among the sources of the most significant uncertainty for the dark matter model building.
  In this work, given the mass of the dark matter, we discuss the feasibility of discriminating four different WDM models: Fermi-Dirac (FD) distribution model, neutrino minimal Standard Model ($\nu$MSM), Dodelson-Widrow (DW), and Shi-Fuller (SF) model. For instance, when the WDM mass is 2\,keV, we show that one can differentiate between CDM, FD, $\nu$MSM, and DW models while discerning between the DW and SF models turns out to be challenging. Our results reinforce the viability of the CNN as a robust analysis for 21cm maps and shed light on its potential to unravel the features associated with different dark matter production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Microwave Background Signatures from Current-carrying Cosmic Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the evolution and cosmological consequences of current-carrying cosmic string networks, described by a charge-velocity-dependent one scale (CVOS) model. We present a detailed calculation of the effects of these networks on the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in the context of this model, and specifically discuss how such current-carrying strings may be distinguished from their uncharged (Nambu-Goto) counterparts by current or forthcoming CMB data. We find that, under the CVOS hypothesis, the constraints on current-carrying strings should not differ much from those of their structureless counterparts in that the impact on the CMB can at most be reduced by a factor of ~25%. Nevertheless, the presence of a current and charge affects the distribution of power among scalar, vector and tensor modes, and also its distribution between small and large scales. It should therefore be possible for future high-sensitivity CMB experiments to distinguish between the two types of strings.</description>

      <title>Spherical bispectrum expansion and quadratic estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a general expansion of spherical (full-sky) bispectra into a set of orthogonal modes. For squeezed shapes, the basis separates physically-distinct signals and is dominated by the lowest moments. In terms of reduced bispectra, we identify a set of discrete polynomials that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the relevant Wigner 3j symbol, and reduce to Chebyshev polynomials in the flat-sky (high-momentum) limit for both parity-even and parity-odd cases. For squeezed shapes, the flat-sky limit is equivalent to previous moment expansions used for CMB bispectra and quadratic estimators, but in general reduces to a distinct expansion in the angular dependence of triangles at fixed total side length (momentum). We use the full-sky expansion to construct a tower of orthogonal CMB lensing quadratic estimators and construct estimators that are immune to foregrounds like point sources or noise inhomogeneities. In parity-even combinations (such as the lensing gradient mode from $TT$, or the lensing curl mode from $EB$) the leading two modes can be identified with information from the magnification and shear respectively, whereas the parity-odd combinations are shear-only. Although not directly separable, we show that these estimators can nonetheless be evaluated numerically sufficiently easily.</description>

      <title>The History of Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We overview the history of primordial black hole (PBH) research from the first papers around 50 years ago to the present epoch. The history may be divided into four periods, the dividing lines being marked by three key developments: inflation on the theoretical front and the detection of microlensing events by the MACHO project and gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA project on the observation front. However, they are also characterised by somewhat different focuses of research. The period 1967-1980 covered the groundbreaking work on PBH formation and evaporation. The period 1980-1996 mainly focussed on their formation, while the period 1996-2016 consolidated the work on formation but also collated the constraints on the PBH abundance. In the period 2016-2024 there was a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs and - while opinions about the strength of the purported evidence vary - this has motivated more careful studies of some aspects of the subject. Certainly the soaring number of papers on PBHs in this last period indicates a growing interest in the topic.</description>

      <title>Constraining the parameters of an isolated neutron star using the lensed HI signal at uGMRT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strength of the HI signal originating from a distant galaxy at a cosmological distance is several orders of magnitude lower than the foreground and background noise and hence it is difficult to observe this signal at a given radio telescope. However, a few recent studies reported the detection of that signal at the radio band suggests the strength of this signal is somehow magnified. In this analysis, we study the prospects of detecting this signal at different frequency bands of the uGMRT where this signal is supposed to be amplified through the strong gravitational lensing by an isolated neutron star located in a cosmological distance. Our study shows the effects of the lensing parameters on the observables of that amplified signal and discusses its variation with the frequency bands considered here. We present a method to estimate the position and size of an isolated neutron star using the signal-to-noise ratio of that signal supposed to be detected at different frequency bands of the uGMRT. We discuss the scope of multi-messenger astronomy in the era of HI observation where the estimated lensing parameters can be cross-validated using the pulsar detection at the X-ray band from the same location in the sky. Our analysis is equally applicable to any radio telescope with given specifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tensor clustering fossils as a possible probe to constrain the theory of gravity, in particular the deviation of the sound speed of gravitational waves from the speed of light at high redshifts. We develop the formalism of the effective Poisson equation to include the novel phenomenological model of the scalar-tensor tidal interactions that are expected to be induced by the modification of the theory of gravity. We show that the tensor clustering fossils can arise from the propagation of gravitational waves, the growth of the large-scale structures, and the second-order contributions from the effective Poisson equation. We construct the small-scale effective Lagrangian from the Horndeski scalar-tensor theory and derive the formula applicable to the tensor clustering fossils in the language of the effective field theory of dark energy. As a demonstration, we apply the formalism to the constraint on the sound speed of gravitational waves in the futuristic survey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that next generation Cosmic Microwave Background experiments will be capable of the first ever measurement of the inflaton coupling to other particles, opening a new window to probe the connection between cosmic inflation and particle physics.This sensitivity is based on the impact that the reheating phase after cosmic inflation has on the redshifting of cosmic perturbations. For our analysis we introduce a simple analytic method to estimate the sensitivity of future CMB observations to the reheating temperature and the inflaton coupling. Applying our method to LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 we find that, within a given model of inflation, these missions have the potential to impose both an upper and a lower bound on the inflaton coupling. Further improvement can be achieved if CMB data is combined with optical and 21cm surveys. Our results demonstrate the potential of future observations to constrain microphysical parameters that can provide an important clue to understand how a given model of inflation may be embedded in a more fundamental theory of nature.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray flux limits from brown dwarfs: Implications for dark matter annihilating into long-lived mediators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs (BDs) are celestial objects representing the link between the least massive main-sequence stars and giant gas planets. In the first part of this article, we perform a model-independent search of a gamma-ray signal from the direction of nine nearby BDs in 13 years of \Fermi-LAT data. We find no significant excess of gamma rays, and we, therefore, set 95\% confidence level upper limits on the gamma-ray flux with a binned-likelihood approach. In the second part of the paper, we interpret these bounds within an exotic mechanism proposed for gamma-ray production in BDs: If the dark matter (DM) of the universe is constituted of particles with non-negligible couplings to the standard model, BDs may efficiently accumulate them through scatterings. DM particles eventually thermalise, and can annihilate into light, long-lived, mediators which later decay into photons outside the BD. Within this framework, the current Fermi-LAT stacked upper limits on the gamma-ray flux of the selected BDs do not enable setting a bound on the DM-nucleon cross-section. An improvement of approximately a factor of 9 in the gamma-ray limits is required to obtain bounds on the scattering cross-section $\sigma_{\chi n}$ $\sim 10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$ for DM masses below 10 GeV. This improvement would cover a larger portion of the parameter space in mediator decay length and DM mass. The code and data to reproduce the results of this study are available on GitLab at \github{https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/francesca.calore/brown-dwarfs-gamma}.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Galaxy Properties on the Underlying 3D Matter Density Field at 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5</title>

Abstract: We study the environmental effect of galaxy evolution as a function of the underlying 3D dark matter density for the first time at $z=2-2.5$, in which the underlying matter density is reconstructed from observed galaxies through dynamical forward modeling techniques. Utilizing this map, we investigate the dependence of the star formation activities and galaxy types (mergers, submillimeter galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quiescent galaxies) on the matter overdensity $\Delta_\text{local}$ and stellar mass. For the first time, we are able to probe underdense regions ($\Delta_\text{local}&lt;1$) in addition to overdensities. We find that star formation activity generally depends on the stellar mass, not the matter density. We also find evidence that: (1) an absence of mergers and submillimeter galaxies in higher-density regions but otherwise no trend across lower-density bins, (2) the increase of active galactic nuclei and quiescent galaxy prevalence as a function of matter density, and (3) the increase of all aforementioned categories with the stellar mass. These results indicate that stellar mass is the main driver of galaxy evolution at the cosmic noon. Our novel approach directly using reconstructed dark matter density maps demonstrates the new capability of the environmental effect studies in galaxy evolution at higher redshift.</description>

      <title>Constraints on holographic QCD phase transitions from PTA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The underlying physics of QCD phase transition in the early Universe remains largely unknown due to its strong-coupling nature during the quark-gluon plasma/hadron gas transition, yet a holographic model has been proposed to quantitatively fit the lattice QCD data while with its duration of the first-order phase transition (FoPT) left undetermined. At specific baryon chemical potential, the first-order QCD phase transition agrees with the observational constraint of baryon asymmetry. It, therefore, provides a scenario for phase transition gravitational waves (GWs) within the Standard Model of particle physics. If these background GWs could contribute dominantly to the recently claimed common-spectrum red noise from pulsar timing array (PTA) observations, the duration of this FoPT can be well constrained, and the associated primordial black holes are still allowed by current observations.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from phase transition generated PBH evaporation with gravitational waves signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of generating dark matter (DM) purely from ultra-light primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation with the latter being produced from a first order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe. If such ultra-light PBH leads to an early matter domination, it can give rise to a doubly peaked gravitational wave (GW) spectrum in Hz-kHz ballpark with the low frequency peak generated from PBH density fluctuations being within near future experimental sensitivity. In the sub-dominant PBH regime, the FOPT generated GW spectrum comes within sensitivity due to absence of entropy dilution. In both the regimes, PBH mass from a few kg can be probed by GW experiments like BBO, ET, CE, UDECIGO etc. while DM mass gets restricted to the superheavy ballpark in the PBH dominance case. Apart from distinct DM mass ranges in the two scenarios, GW observations can differentiate by measuring their distinct spectral shapes.</description>

      <title>Stringy constraints on primordial electromagnetic fields in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study primordial electromagnetic fields in effective actions of string theory. In contrast to a conventional scenario of producing primordial electromagnetic fields induced by the axion inflation, we deal with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action as a non-linear generation of Maxwell theory. It turns out that the intensity of generated electromagnetic fields is bounded from above by the string scale which can also be rewritten in terms of supersymmetry breaking scale in the context of type IIB Large Volume Scenario. The instability parameter $\xi$ is constrained by the tadpole cancellation condition of D3-branes and a realization of hierarchy between the string scale and the Hubble scale of inflation. Hence, the magnetogenesis can be realized in the limited corner of the string landscape due to the ${\cal O}(1)$ value of the coefficient of Chern-Simons coupling.</description>
