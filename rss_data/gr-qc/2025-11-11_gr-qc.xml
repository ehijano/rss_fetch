      <title>Quantum-corrected gravitational collapse and multi-messenger signatures: Beyond spherical symmetry in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for multi-messenger signatures arising from quantum-corrected gravitational collapse within an extended Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) loop quantum gravity model incorporating perturbative asymmetries. By developing a consistent perturbation theory for non-spherical modes on the quantum-corrected spherically symmetric background, we resolve the fundamental tension between spherical symmetry assumptions and gravitational wave emission requirements. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum geometric effects naturally seed asymmetric perturbations during the bounce phase, leading to observable gravitational wave bursts with mass-dependent frequencies in the range $f_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-3}$--$10^{3}$ Hz and distinctive electromagnetic counterparts via quantum field effects in curved spacetime. Through self-consistent calculations based on the effective AOS framework, we compute the coupling between quantum bounce dynamics and perturbative modes, yielding gravitational wave strains $h \sim 10^{-23}$--$10^{-21}$ at 100 Mpc for primordial black holes with masses $M \sim 1$--$100$ $M_{\odot}$. The electromagnetic emission mechanism is analyzed through detailed calculations of dynamic Casimir effects and coherent field amplification in time-dependent quantum geometry. Our parameter sensitivity analysis reveals detection prospects that are critically dependent on primordial black hole abundance constraints, with realistic event rates of $\mc{R} \sim 10^{-3}$--$10^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ within current observational limits. These results provide testable predictions for quantum gravity theories while extending previous work beyond spherical symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic MOND Theory from Modified Entropic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a relativistic extension of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) within the framework of entropic gravity by introducing temperature-dependent corrections to the equipartition law on a holographic screen. Starting from a Debye-like modification of the surface degrees of freedom and employing the Unruh relation between acceleration and temperature, we obtain modified Einstein equations in which the geometric sector acquires explicit thermal corrections. Solving these equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime in the weak-field, low-temperature regime yields a corrected metric that smoothly approaches Minkowski space at large radii and naturally contains a characteristic acceleration scale. In the very-low-acceleration regime, the model reproduces MOND-like deviations from Newtonian dynamics while providing a relativistic underpinning for that phenomenology. We confront the theory with rotation-curve data for NGC~3198 and perform a Bayesian parameter inference, comparing our relativistic MOND (RMOND) model with both a baryons-only Newtonian model and a dark-matter halo model. We find that RMOND and the dark-matter model both fit the data significantly better than the baryons-only Newtonian prediction, and that RMOND provides particularly improved agreement at $r\gtrsim 20\,\mathrm{kpc}$. These results suggest that temperature-corrected entropic gravity provides a viable relativistic framework for MOND phenomenology, motivating further observational tests, including gravitational lensing and extended galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>Topologically Stabilized Torsion in Weak-Field Gravity: A Ricci-Flow Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stationary torsional configurations supported by chiral Majorana neutrino currents in linearized gravity. A Ricci-flow-inspired geometric relaxation (with no physical time interpretation) is introduced to drive the metric perturbation toward fixed points sustained by chiral sources while keeping curvature invariants negligible. We show that divergence-free chiral currents can support globally non-trivial torsional holonomy stabilized by topological invariants associated with the fundamental groups pi1(S1) and pi3(S3). Toroidal skyrmionic domains emerge when one chirality dominates, whereas a chiral-flip interference sector enables Moebius-type non-orientable bridges between opposite-chirality regions. In the static limit, a Green-function formulation provides a finite-range Yukawa-type response governed by the neutrino coherence length. These results identify a purely torsional mechanism, independent of local curvature, through which coherent chiral currents may influence effective gravitational behavior in neutrino-rich environments.</description>

      <title>Two-body Dirac equation in DSR: results for fermion-antifermion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a modified two-body Dirac equation in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, inspired by Amelino-Camelia's doubly special relativity (DSR). We begin by deriving a covariant two-body Dirac equation that, in the absence of DSR modifications, reduces to a Bessel-type wave equation. Incorporating corrections from the chosen DSR model modifies this wave equation, yielding solutions consistent with established results in the low-energy regime. We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become particularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled fermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By accounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the fine-structure constant \alpha behaves as an energy-dependent running parameter, given by \(\alpha_{eff(E)}/\alpha \approx 1 - \frac{E}{4E_p}\), where E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a first-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied to positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce shifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified two-body equations have not been previously studied. This model is the first of its kind, opening new avenues for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Quantum enforcement of strong cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the trace anomaly of quantum field theory is sufficient to enforce strong cosmic censorship in any stationary spacetime with an inner horizon of nonzero surface gravity. In the two-dimensional dilaton reduction of four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal fields, the anomaly-induced Polyakov term yields a finite $\langle T_{vv}\rangle \to \frac{N}{48\pi}\kappa_-^2$ near the Cauchy horizon, while the affine-frame energy grows as $T_{kk}\propto e^{2\kappa_- v}$. The resulting tidal blow-up converts the inner horizon into a null, Tipler-strong singularity. The mechanism is local, universal, and state-independent, and extends to Kerr/Kerr-Newman, $\Lambda&gt;0$, and nonsingular interiors. Thus, the trace anomaly is the minimal quantum ingredient restoring strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Primordial observables of explicit diffeomorphism violation in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential for current and future gravitational-wave detectors to observe imprints of explicit diffeomorphism violation in primordial signals. Starting from a simple model with known effects, we derive the strain amplitude and power spectrum for primordial gravitational waves, both of which are affected by the symmetry breaking. Through this, we directly find predictions for the tensor spectral index and tensor-to-scalar which are different from general relativity. By considering the known sensitivity curves for NANOGrav, SKA, THEIA, $\mu$-ARES, ASTROD-GW, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, AION-km, AEDGE, ET, and aLIGO, we place observability limits on the parameters controlling the diffeomorphism violation. For instance, we find that aLIGO could observe signals for \(s_{00} \lesssim -0.1\), while more sensitive future detectors like LISA and DECIGO could probe violations as small as \(s_{00} \approx -5 \times 10^{-4}\) and \(-3 \times 10^{-3}\), respectively. Finally, we consider the existing constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ which is tightly constrained by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis, where we find that $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ only weakly depends on the symmetry breaking but places a lower bound on the coefficients which is consistent with available bounds from the speed of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Cosmologically Viable Solutions in Geometric Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe highlighted General Relativity's inability to naturally account for dark energy without invoking a finely tuned cosmological constant. In response, a wide range of alternative paradigms have been proposed. Among these, Teleparallel Gravity and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity, which depart from the Riemannian framework of General Relativity and instead rely on torsion or non-metricity to describe gravitational interactions, have gained increasing attention in recent years. We explore extensions of these non-Riemannian approaches, aiming to replicate the observed late-time acceleration of the universe by emulating the cosmological constant's role. We also evaluate the consistency of these theories with local gravity constraints by studying their static, spherically symmetric solutions. We show that although some models can reproduce the desired cosmological behavior, they often fail to meet Solar System observational bounds, particularly through deviations in the predicted Eddington parameter. Our findings underscore the need for a unified approach that tests modified gravity theories across both cosmological and local scales.</description>

      <title>A Universal Framework for Horizon-Scale Tests of Gravity with Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we have developed a numerically efficient framework for evaluating parameters in metric theories of gravity, and applied it to constrain the horizon-scale magnetic field in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) spacetime using the latest EHT observations. The method's adaptive ray-tracing strategy achieves near-linear computational efficiency without loss of numerical accuracy. Owing to this efficiency, the framework enables high precision shadow modeling at minimal computational cost and, for the first time, supports statistically robust inference of black hole parameters from horizon-scale observations for arbitrary stationary black holes. The above framework is applied to the recently obtained Kerr-BR black hole, an exact magnetized and rotating solution to the Einstein field equations. We have evaluated the horizon-scale magnetic fields of M87* and Sgr A*, with the latter showing a field strength of $93.3^{+14.7}_{-23.8}G$, consistent with the equipartition estimate of $71G$ from polarized ALMA observations, thereby supporting Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <title>Charged black hole accelerated by spatially homogeneous electric field of Bertotti-Robinson (AdS2 x S2) space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple exact solution of the Einstein - Maxwell field equations for charged non-rotating black hole accelerated by an external electric field is presented. The background space-time, described by the well known Bertotti-Robinson solution, contains a spatially homogeneous electric field and possess the topology AdS2 x S2. The black hole mass m, its charge e and the value of the background electric field E are free parameters of the constructed solution. In the "rigid" (non-inertial) reference frame comoving a black hole, this solution is static. The value of acceleration of a black hole due to its interaction with the external electric field is determined by the condition of vanishing of conical singularities on the axis of symmetry. The dynamics of a charged black hole in the external electric field is compared with the behaviour of a charged test particle with the same charge to mass ratio.</description>

      <title>Constraining Exponential f(Q) Gravity with Cosmic Chronometers and Supernovae: A Data-Driven Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paper reports an investigation of the cosmological implications of symmetric teleparallel gravity within a modified $f(Q)$ theory. We construct a specific exponential $f(Q)$ model as $f(Q) = Q + \eta_1 Q_0\left(1 - e^{-\eta_2 \sqrt{Q/Q_0}}\right)$, designed to smoothly deviate from General Relativity and accommodate both early-time inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. By employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we constrain the model parameters $\eta_1$, $\eta_2$, $H_0$, and $\Omega_{m_0}$ using a combination of cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and Pantheon$^+$ Supernovae datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that the model consistently supports a late-time acceleration scenario and is in good agreement with current cosmological observations. We extensively analyze the dynamical behavior of the model using key cosmological diagnostics, including the deceleration parameter, equation of state, energy density parameters, Statefinder, and Om diagnostics. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and distance modulus $\mu(z)$ show strong consistency with $\Lambda$CDM and observational data, while subtle deviations at higher redshifts highlight the value of multi-probe observations. In addition, the examination of energy conditions shows that, in accordance with cosmic acceleration, the Strong Energy Condition (SEC) is broken at lower redshifts while the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and Null Energy Condition (NEC) are satisfied. Cosmic age estimates from the model are consistently in agreement with Planck constraints. Our results indicate the viability of exponential $f(Q)$ gravity. A comparative statistical analysis reveals that while $\Lambda$CDM remains statistically preferred based on AIC and BIC criteria, the exponential $f(Q)$ model yields comparable fits and remains a theoretically motivated and viable alternative for describing cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>SSFDE Model: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an interacting scalar field dark energy model with an exponential potential and a dark sector coupling \( Q = 3\gamma H\rho_{dm} \), which has been observationally tested using recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 , Unanchored Type Ia Supernovae, and the compressed CMB likelihood. We find that the Interacting model predicts a Hubble constant of $h = 0.659 \pm 0.0063$, deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM value by approximately $2.93\sigma$, while the Non-Interacting model shows a $3.78\sigma$ deviation. The positive coupling parameter (\( \gamma &gt; 0 \)) further suggests a transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy. According to the Jeffreys scale, the Interacting model shows moderate evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas the Non-Interacting model shows only inconclusive evidence. Further, we investigate both models through the lens of dynamical systems analysis. We formulate the cosmological evolution equations with a phenomenological interaction term and recast them into an autonomous system to study the qualitative behavior of cosmic expansion. Critical points of the system are identified and analyzed to study the corresponding cosmological dynamics. In the interacting model, we obtained five critical points, whereas in the non-interacting scenario, four distinct sets of critical points were identified. The obtained critical points, governed by cosmological parameters, represent distinct cosmic epochs, commencing from the early time stiff matter domination to late-time acceleration. Their stability is examined through linear stability analysis under appropriate physical constraints. The evolution of background cosmological parameters are also examined in terms of the dynamical system variable, and the obtained values align with observational results.</description>

      <title>Black holes and black regions, horizons and barriers in Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if S is a time-oriented null hypersurface of a Lorentzian n-manifold (M, g), the causal world-lines, which intersect transversally S and are time-oriented in a compatible way, cross the hypersurface all in the same direction, the other being forbidden. Even if it is known that a smooth event horizon (in the sense of Penrose, Hawking and Ellis) is a null hypersurface and has the above semi-permeability property, at the best of our knowledge, it was not known so far that the latter is a mere consequence of the former. Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers). These objects naturally include (smooth) event horizons and (smoothly bounded) black holes. Since barriers are defined by two simple properties -- the merely local property of "nullity" combined with the global property of "separating the space-time" -- we expect they may be used to simplify computations for locating static and/or dynamic horizons in numerical computations.</description>

      <title>The extended inner shadow of Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole with thin disk flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply numerical backward ray-tracing to study the observational appearance of Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) black holes illuminated by thin accretion disk flows. We obtained the inner shadow, redshift characteristics, and intensity distribution of thin-disk images of the KTN black hole, as observed by a common observer located at different positions. The results show that increasing the spin parameter progressively deforms the critical curve into a "D" shape while simultaneously shrinking and distorting the inner shadow. More importantly, for n = 0.3 at theta_o = 80 degrees, the inner shadow develops a novel "duck-cap-like" morphology with a sharply protruding lower-right edge beyond the critical curve. We term this feature the "extended inner shadow", a structure distinct from the Kerr case. Unlike the standard inner shadow, it consists partly of photons absorbed by the horizon and partly of photons that avoid both absorption and crossing the disk plane, thus receiving no emission. Such deviations from Kerr predictions could be tested by future high-precision astronomical observations, potentially offering new evidence for the existence of NUT charge (or the gravitomagnetic monopole) in black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the cosmological implications of nonminimally coupled $f(Q)$ gravity are examined within the metric-affine formalism, in which the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ couples directly to the matter Lagrangian. Within the symmetric teleparallel framework, a representative $f(Q)$ model is constructed, and the corresponding background cosmological equations are derived. The analysis aims to test whether this geometric formulation yields more consistent realizations of nonminimal matter-geometry couplings. A comprehensive statistical MCMC analysis is performed using cosmic chronometers, DESI BAO DR2, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+, DESY5, and Union3 samples. To complement the statistical study, we employ machine learning methods, such as linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest algorithms, to evaluate the predictive performance and robustness of the data. The results indicate that a partial alleviation of the $H_0$ tension can be achieved for a broad range of parameter choices. Nonetheless, $f(Q)$ gravity emerges as a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, motivating further exploration of extended models consistent with all observations.</description>

      <title>The curvature perturbations and induced gravitational waves induced by the first-order phase transition during reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism where a first-order phase transition modulates the decay rate of a massive field. This modulation, even if the scalar field has negligible energy density, subsequently generates an observable stochastic gravitational-wave background. The stochastic nature of bubble nucleation leads to the asynchrony of phase transitions, generating superhorizon-scale density perturbations through spatial variations in the decay rate $\Gamma$. These perturbations subsequently source second-order gravitational waves with peak amplitudes governed by the phase transition parameter \(\beta/H_*\) and decay rate $\Gamma$.
  We apply this mechanism in the reheating scanario where the decay rate of inflaton are modulated by the scalar field that undergoes a first-order phase transition.
  Numerical calculations reveal that the gravitational wave energy spectrum typically reaches \(\Omega_{\text{GW}} \sim 10^{-10}\), demonstrating prospects for detection by space-based interferometers like LISA, TianQin and Taiji.
  This work establishes a new approach to probe phase transition processes in the early Universe without requiring significant vacuum energy release.</description>

      <title>Inflationary models in $f(R,T)$ gravity: Constraints from $Planck$, BICEP/$Keck$, and Atacama</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of high-precision cosmological observations has challenged many traditional inflationary models. Data from $Planck$ 2018 along with the BICEP/$Keck$ 2018 result have already ruled out most of the established models by placing tight constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Upcoming missions like LiteBIRD &amp; CMB-S4 are expected to impose an even more stringent bound on $r$ , potentially excluding further models from the viable landscape. In this evolving observational context, modified gravity theories offer a promising way to reconcile inflationary models with data. In this work, we explore several inflationary models, namely mutated hilltop inflation, D-brane inflation, and Woods-Saxon inflation, within the framework of $f(R, T)$ gravity. The cosmological observable parameters, viz. scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and running of scalar spectral index $n_{sk}$ are estimated for the three models, and their trajectories are plotted in the $n_s-r$ plane. The model results are evaluated in light of the $Planck$, BICEP/$Keck$, DESI DR2, and ACT DR6 data. We observe that for a certain model parameter space, these potentials are viable within the current observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Constraining Black Hole Horizon Properties Through Long-Duration Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a long-duration Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave data to constrain the near-horizon geometry of black holes formed in binary mergers. Deviations from the Kerr geometry are parameterized by replacing the horizon's absorbing boundary with a reflective surface at a fractional distance epsilon. This modification produces long-lived monochromatic quasinormal modes that can be probed through extended integration times. Building on previous work that set a bound of log10(epsilon) = -23.5 for GW150914, we reproduce and validate those results and extend the analysis to additional events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. By combining posterior samples from multiple detections, we construct a joint posterior yielding a tightened 90 percent upper bound of log10(epsilon) &lt; -27.12, demonstrating the statistical power of population-level inference through cumulative evidence. Finally, analyzing the newly observed high signal-to-noise ratio event GW250114 from the O4b run, we obtain the most stringent single-event constraint to date, log10(epsilon) &lt; -29.58 (90 percent credible region). Our findings provide the strongest observational support to date for the Kerr geometry as the correct description of post-merger black holes, with no detectable horizon-scale deviations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Limit of Growing Gravitational Wave Memory from Sources in the Early Universe and Astrophysical Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt;1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.</description>

      <title>Topological Thermodynamics of Black Holes: Revisiting the methods of winding numbers calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the equivalence between two methods for computing winding numbers is established: the approach of $\phi$-mapping topological current and the residue method. The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of bound timelike geodesic orbits in effective-one-body frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the approximate analytical solutions of the bound timelike geodesic orbits in the effective-one-body (EOB) frame with extreme-mass ratio limit. The analytical solutions are expressed in terms of the elliptic integrals using Mino time $\lambda$ as the independent variable. Since Mino time decouples the $r$ and $\theta$-motion, we also give explicit expressions for three orbital frequencies $\Omega_r, ~\Omega_\theta, ~\Omega_\phi$ using the Fourier series expansion. With these analytical expressions at hand, we can perform Fourier expansions in Mino time $\lambda$ for any function expressed in terms of the coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the observer's time t is decomposed into Mino time $\lambda$, and the frequency-domain description is constructed from the $\lambda$-Fourier expansion and the expansion of t. These analytical expressions are quite simple to implement, and can be applicable for calculating gravitational waves (GWs) from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with the frequency-domain Teukolsky equation.</description>

      <title>Force-free Electrodynamics in Arbitrary Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in extreme astrophysical environments are effectively modeled by Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE), a framework essential for studying objects like neutron stars and accreting black holes. The inherently nonlinear nature of the FFE equations makes finding exact solutions a challenging task. This paper explores an innovative approach to solving these equations by foliating spacetime into two-dimensional surfaces, specifically tailored to the geometry of electromagnetic fields. The foliation approach exploits the fact that the kernel of the force-free field defines an involutive distribution, naturally lending itself to a geometric decomposition. This method has previously been applied with great success in Kerr and FLRW spacetimes. By extending this formalism, we develop new exact solutions to the FFE equations in several distinct spacetimes, including cases where the metric remains partially undetermined. Additionally, we present a novel class of solutions that smoothly transition between magnetically dominated and electrically dominated regimes over time. Finally, we construct a pair of vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes, further demonstrating the utility of the foliation approach. These results offer a new perspective on the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic fields and their geometric underpinnings in various spacetime geometries, broadening the applicability of the framework for understanding the dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in general relativistic astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>A Modified Gravitational Theory of the Matter Sector of the Type $\phi(R,T)\mathcal{L}_{m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a modified gravity framework where the geometric Einstein--Hilbert sector remains untouched while the matter Lagrangian is weighted by a nontrivial function $\phi(T)$ of the energy--momentum trace. Unlike $f(R,T)$ or $f(R,\mathcal L_m)$ theories, this construction alters how matter curves spacetime without introducing extra geometric degrees of freedom, thereby remaining consistent with local tests of gravity. Physically, the factor $\phi(T)\mathcal L_m$ can be interpreted as an effective renormalization of the matter sector, relevant at high densities and smoothly reducing to GR at low densities. Within this setup we identify a robust window in parameter space leading to a smooth and nonsingular cosmological bounce, with bounded density, finite $\dot H&gt;0$ at the bounce, and preservation of the infrared limit where $\Lambda$CDM is recovered. This mechanism provides a natural route to singularity resolution while retaining the empirical successes of standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Exponential $f(R)$ cosmology with massive neutrinos as a dynamical dark energy framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential $f(R)$ gravity model provides a theoretically well-motivated extension of General Relativity, introducing a modified gravitational dynamics at late times consistent with a dynamical dark energy scenario, while recovering the $\Lambda$CDM-like regime at high redshifts with a smooth transition. Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we constrain the parameters of the exponential $f(R)$ model in combination with the total neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$, employing the latest measurements from cosmic chronometers, the DESI DR2 BAO data, the CMB acoustic scale, and the Pantheon+ supernovae compilation, comparing the results with the $\Lambda$CDM and the $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our results show that the exponential $f(R)$ model remains consistent with current observations while slightly alleviating the Hubble tension and the neutrino mass problem relative to $\Lambda$CDM, although the constraints on $\sum m_\nu$ are tighter than those obtained for the phenomenological $w_0w_a$CDM scenario. These results indicate that the interplay between modified gravity and neutrino physics in the late Universe may offer a viable framework for further investigation of cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of distorted gravitational waves by lensing using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be distorted by intervening mass distributions while propagating, leading to frequency-dependent modulations that imprint a distinct signature on the observed waveforms. Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. \texttt{DINGO-lensing} provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.</description>

      <title>On the Validity of the Background Subtraction Method for Black Hole Thermodynamics in Matter-Coupled Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer-Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer-Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.</description>

      <title>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</description>

      <title>Magnusian: Relating the Eikonal Phase, the On-Shell Action, and the Scattering Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two fundamentally distinct quantities are both called "eikonal" in present amplitudes literature. The unitarity of the S-matrix ensures it can be written as the exponential of a Hermitian operator. The eikonal generator or Magnusian, which is the classical limit of the expectation value of that operator, generates all scattering observables. The leading order classical behavior of the phase of S-matrix elements is called the eikonal phase, and it coincides with the classical on-shell action. We demonstrate that the eikonal generator (Magnusian) and the eikonal phase (classical on-shell action) are inequivalent and find the exact general relationship between them. That relationship explains the special case of integrable scattering in which the two do coincide up to a Legendre transformation and explains why such a correspondence fails in general when spin or radiation are included.</description>

      <title>Grand Unification Higgs-$\mathcal{R}^2$ Inflation: Complementarity between Proton Decay and CMB Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a predictive $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework for cosmic inflation in the Palatini $\mathcal{R}^2$ formulation of gravity. In this model, a GUT Higgs field both drives inflation and induces intermediate-scale symmetry breaking, thereby linking primordial cosmology, gauge unification, and topological defect formation. A partial inflationary phase of $N_I \sim 10$--$17$ $e$-folds following monopole formation can dilute magnetic monopoles to abundances $Y_M \sim 10^{-35}$--$10^{-27}$. The model yields Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) predictions of $0.955 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.974$, accommodating the tensions between Planck-BICEP ($n_s \approx 0.965$) and Planck+ACT ($n_s \approx 0.971$) via $\phi &lt; M$ and $\phi &gt; M$ branches repectively. The predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 8\times10^{-4}$ lies within current observational constraints and is accessible to forthcoming experiments, including the Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD. The resulting correlations between the unification scale $M_U$, the inflationary observables $(n_s, r)$, and proton-decay lifetimes highlight a complementarity between CMB measurements and proton-decay searches, with regions of parameter space testable in forthcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |\Phi|^2 \ln \left( |\Phi|^2/\Lambda^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $\Lambda$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity
  $\xi |\Phi|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $\lambda |\Phi|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $\xi \approx 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a limit curve theorem for incomplete metric spaces. Our main application is to Sormani and Vegas' null distance, where our results give strong control on the Lorentzian lengths of limit curves. We also show that regular cosmological time functions and the surface function of a Cauchy surface in a globally hyperbolic manifold define such a null distance.</description>

      <title>Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06018v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.
  One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).
  In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that "similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand".</description>

      <title>AthenaK Simulations of Magnetized Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new numerical-relativity simulations of a magnetized binary neutron star merger performed with AthenaK. The simulations employ a temperature- and composition-dependent tabulated nuclear equation of state, with initially dipolar fields with a maximum initial strength of ${\sim}10^{16}\ {\rm G}$ which extend outside the stars. We employ adaptive mesh refinement and consider three grid resolutions, with grid spacing down to $\Delta x_{\rm min} \simeq 92\ {\rm m}$ in the most refined region. When comparing the two highest resolution simulations, we find orbital dephasing of over 7 orbits until merger of only $0.06$ radians. The magnetic field is amplified during the merger and we observe the formation of a magnetized funnel in the polar region of the remnant. Simulations are continued until about $30$ milliseconds after merger. However, due to significant baryonic pollution, the binary fails to produce a magnetically-dominated outflow. Finally, we discuss possible numerical and physical effects that might alter this outcome.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the spectrum of stationary black hole solutions associated with the first non-trivial member of the Dym family of boundary conditions. The analysis combines the holonomy conditions provided by the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$ gravity with the periodic solutions of the stationary Dym equation. The resulting spacetimes are characterized by two positive real parameters, two positive integers, and a relative phase, generically describing stationary, non-axisymmetric black holes.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky Inflation and the Latest CMB Data: A Subtle Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.</description>

      <title>Turnover detection using the power spectrum and bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The turnover at the peak of the Fourier matter power spectrum encodes a fundamental signature of matter-radiation equality in the early Universe. This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations. These surveys are forecast to detect the turnover at $\sim\! 6\sigma$ (Euclid-like) and $\sim\! 15\sigma$ (MegaMapper-like), with precision on the turnover scale of $\sim\! 4\%$ and $\sim\! 2\%$. The inclusion of the bispectrum delivers a modest improvement of $\sim\! 10-17\%$ in the constraints on the turnover scale.</description>

      <title>The Geometric View of Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the "shape" that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in the Seiberg-Witten theory (Seiberg and Witten, 1994a,b), where the moduli space is the complex plane with three punctures, the states and quantities are in the fibres, and the modular group is the structure group that acts on the fibres. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed derivation of the Schwarzian modes in the full geometry of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole at finite temperature, establishing the precise conditions under which they emerge from the general solution. In addition, we demonstrate that the same modes can be recovered through a purely geometric Kerr-Schild construction. This equivalent approach offers a new geometric understanding of the Schwarzian sector and highlights the correspondence between perturbative and pure geometric approaches, additionally it provides a connection with double copy and double field theory.</description>

      <title>The poltergeist mechanism -- Enhancement of scalar-induced gravitational waves with early matter-dominated era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial density perturbations provide a powerful probe of the Universe's thermal history, which may include an early matter-dominated (eMD) era predicted by well-motivated particle-physics models. The induced GWs can be significantly enhanced when the Universe undergoes a sudden transition from an eMD era to an era with pressure, such as a radiation or kination era. This enhancement arises from the growth of density perturbations during the eMD era and their rapid oscillations during the era with pressure. This phenomenon is called the poltergeist mechanism. In this review, we explain the essence of the poltergeist mechanism and explore concrete scenarios in which such an enhancement can occur.</description>

Abstract: In Nature, 646, 813 (2025), Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantised) gravity produces entanglement. We show that their model does not produce entanglement. Even if the model produced entanglement, it would be mediated by the quantised matter interaction, and not gravity. Hence entanglement mediated by gravity remains an unambiguous witness of gravity's quantum features.</description>

      <title>samsara: A Continuous-Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampler for Trans-Dimensional Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference requires determining the posterior distribution, a task that becomes particularly challenging when the dimension of the parameter space is large and unknown. This limitation arises in many physics problems, such as Mixture Models (MM) with an unknown number of components or the inference of overlapping signals in noisy data, as in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Global Fit problem. Traditional approaches, such as product-space methods or Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), often face efficiency and convergence limitations. This paper presents samsara, a Continuous-Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CTMCMC) framework that models parameter evolution through Poisson-driven birth, death, and mutation processes. samsara is designed to sample models of unknown dimensionality. By requiring detailed balance through adaptive rate definitions, CTMCMC achieves automatic acceptance of trans-dimensional moves and high sampling efficiency. The code features waiting time weighted estimators, optimized memory storage, and a modular design for easy customization. We validate samsara on three benchmark problems: an analytic trans-dimensional distribution, joint inference of sine waves and Lorentzians in time series, and a Gaussian MM with an unknown number of components. In all cases, the code shows excellent agreement with analytical and Nested Sampling results. All these features push samsara as a powerful alternative to RJMCMC for large- and variable-dimensional Bayesian inference problems.</description>

Abstract: We consider scalar perturbations of the Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m family and the Kerr family. We derive a characteristic expression of the radiation field, at any given unit solid angle of future null infinity, and numerically show that its amplitude gets excited only in the extremal case. Our work, therefore, identifies an observational signature for extremal black holes. Moreover, we show that the source of the excitation is the extremal horizon instability and its magnitude is exactly equal to the conserved horizon charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of binary black-hole (BBH) coalescences are expected to address outstanding questions in astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Realizing the full discovery potential of upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing runs and new ground-based facilities hinges on accurate waveform models. Using linear-signal approximation methods and Bayesian analysis, we start to assess our readiness for what lies ahead using two state-of-the-art quasi-circular, spin-precessing models: \texttt{SEOBNRv5PHM} and \texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM}. We ascertain that current waveforms can accurately recover the distribution of masses in the LVK astrophysical population, but not spins. We find that systematic biases increase with detector-frame total mass, binary asymmetry, and spin-precession, with most such binaries incurring parameter biases, extending up to redshifts $\sim3$ in future detectors. Furthermore, we examine three ``golden'' events characterized by large mass ratios, significant spin magnitudes, and high precession, evaluating how systematic biases may affect their scientific outcomes. Our findings reveal that current waveforms fail to enable the unbiased measurement of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter from loud signals, even for current detectors. Moreover, highly asymmetric systems within the lower BH mass-gap exhibit biased measurements of the secondary-companion mass, which impacts the physics of both neutron stars and formation channels. Similarly, we deduce that the primary mass of massive binaries ($ &gt; 60 M_\odot$) will also be biased, affecting supernova physics. Future progress in analytical calculations and numerical-relativity simulations, crucial for calibrating the models, must target regions of the parameter space with significant biases to develop more accurate models. Only then can precision GW astronomy fulfill the promise it holds.</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig formalism for early cosmic inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of fluctuations at the early stage of the universe provides enough confidence to rely on averaging methods. However, the nonlinearity of general relativity makes this process extremely difficult. Several methods have been proposed to study inhomogeneous cosmology and address the averaging problem, such as Buchert's spatial averaging. In this work, early cosmic inflation is investigated using the Buchert equations and the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. The coarse-grained description derived from these approaches acts as a geometrical source of early cosmic inflation through higher-order differential equations. The theoretical results, while not an exact match, exhibit close agreement with observational data, demonstrating the robustness of the model and its potential for further cosmological applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. Interestingly, the solution we find may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby it would be the additional hair. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics or this hair affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>A conservative solution to the Singularity Problem in Classical GR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a conservative approach to the black hole singularity problem that remains within the framework of classical General Relativity (GR) supplemented by semiclassical quantum field theory (QFT). Our construction replaces the singular interior of a black hole with a null characteristic hypersurface that carries the exterior ADM data. The excised singular interior is replaced by a conformally flat bubble manifold. We assume the characteristic data on $\Sigma$ are shear-quiet (vanishing Bondi news and shear to leading order) so that the initial development is conformally flat (Weyl = 0) over an early epoch. We further posit that the ingoing Hawking radiation flux provides statistically isotropic initial conditions on the bubble boundary, seeding a nearly FLRW-like epoch without first undergoing exponential inflation. The overall framework is consistent with the generalized second law of thermodynamics and offers a possible resolution of the singularity problem without invoking a full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Big-Bang nucleosynthesis constraints on (dual) Kaniadakis cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of Kaniadakis entropy and its dual formulation, examining their implications for gravitational dynamics within the framework where gravity emerges as an entropic force resulting from changes in the informational content of a physical system. In this context, we derive a modified form of Newton's law of gravitation that reflects the corrections introduced by both Kaniadakis entropy and its dual state. Furthermore, we apply the emergent gravity scenario at large scales and derive the modified Friedmann equations incorporating corrections from (dual) Kaniadakis entropy. Our results provide deeper insights into the interplay between thermodynamics and gravitational dynamics. In order to constrain the model parameter, we study the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis in the context of (dual) Kaniadakis cosmology. We explore an alternative method to establish limits on the Kaniadakis parameter, denoted as $K$, by examining how (dual) Kaniadakis cosmology influences the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. Our analysis indicates that the obtained ranges for the dual Kaniadakis parameter (unlike the Kaniadakis parameter) exhibit overlap for the aforementioned light elements, and the allowed values fall within the range $ -0.8\times 10^{-78}\lesssim \tilde {K^*}\lesssim 0.8\times 10^{-78}$, which shows that the deviations from the conventional Bekenstein-Hawking formula are minimal, as expected. This consistency between the ranges suggests a potential solution to the well-known \textit{Lithium problem}. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ within the framework of (dual) Kaniadakis cosmology.</description>

      <title>Fully Relativistic Treatment of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Collisionless Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes from EFT of Black Hole Perturbations in Vector-Tensor Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric black hole background with a timelike vector field based on the effective field theory (EFT) approach. We derive the quadratic Lagrangian written in terms of two master variables, corresponding to the tensor and vector gravitons, which are coupled in general, while they can be decoupled on a stealth Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) background. For the stealth Schwarzschild background, we find that the quasinormal mode frequencies for both degrees of freedom are obtained from those in general relativity by simple scaling. Nonetheless, due to the fact that the metric perturbation is a non-trivial linear combination of the two degrees of freedom with different QNM spectra, the ringdown gravitational waves may exhibit characteristic modulation that can in principle be a signature of vector-tensor gravity.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Extended Uncertainty Principle in the context of black hole solutions coming from non-local theories of gravity, focusing, specifically, on Infinite Derivative Gravity. We argue that these modifications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are effective descriptions arising from the non-local features of gravitational interaction. By comparing the predictions of both the modified uncertainty principles and non-local gravity, we find theoretical constraints on otherwise free parameters as well as universal laws for black hole physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Matter-antimatter asymmetry in a rotating universe: Dirac spinors in axisymmetric Bianchi IX cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on a highly symmetric FLRW geometry, successfully explains many observations but faces unresolved issues, motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological frameworks. We investigate the influence of spacetime geometry on the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe within the Bianchi IX cosmological model. Motivated by early-universe dynamics, potential contributions to cosmological angular momentum, and the axisymmetric Bianchi IX model's relevance to certain CMB anomalies, we formulate the Dirac field in this background. Starting with a Lagrangian formalism, we derive the Dirac equation and develop the harmonic analysis of spinor fields, extending previous treatments in the Mixmaster universe. We solve the Dirac equations for non-rotating and rotating axisymmetric Bianchi IX spacetimes using a fixed-background approximation. We find that spatial anisotropy induces spin-dependent energy splittings, while global rotation produces particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the energy spectra, effects absent in FLRW models. These results demonstrate that spacetime geometry alone can imprint nontrivial structure on particle spectra, suggesting that geometric effects may contribute to the matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by $P_{eff}:=-\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}V$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$. In this case, if $\alpha&gt;0$, the effective pressure is always negative, but if $\alpha&lt;0$, it is not always negative and has a minimum. The effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Confronting general relativity with principal component analysis: Simulations and results from GWTC-3 events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using principal component analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational-wave (GW) signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo GW detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects--such as orbital eccentricity--can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider self-gravitating stationary configurations of a charged massive complex Proca field, also known as charged Proca stars, in the particular case of spherical symmetry. We first present a general 3+1 decomposition of the Einstein--Maxwell--Proca system, starting from the action and field equations. We then restrict our system to the case of spherical symmetry and, after imposing a harmonic time dependence ansatz for the Proca field, we construct families of charged Proca stars for different values of the charge parameter $q$, and different values of the central Proca scalar potential $\varphi$. In a similar way to the case of scalar boson stars, one can define a critical charge $q=q_c$ that corresponds to the value for which the Coulomb repulsion of the charged Proca field exactly cancels their newtonian gravitational attraction. We find that supercritical solutions can exist for a limited range of charges above the critical value $q&gt;q_c$. We also consider the binding energy $E_B$ for the different families of solutions, and find that gravitationally bound solutions such that $E_B&lt;0$ can only exist for subcritical charges such that $q&lt;q_c$, indicating that our supercritical solutions are probably dynamically unstable against perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electric Penrose process in ABG(-dS) regular black holes, examining the influence of the black hole charge and the cosmological constant on the negative-energy region and energy extraction efficiency. Compared with RN(-dS) black holes, ABG(-dS) black holes have a larger negative-energy region, which allows this process to occur farther from the horizons, and higher energy extraction efficiency. This is especially true when the splitting point is close to the event horizon, and the difference widens as the black hole charge increases. Even when the black hole charge and cosmological constant take very small values relevant to astrophysics, significant differences still exist, with the maximum efficiency ratio being approximately 23/8. This indicates that in real astrophysical scenarios, ABG(-dS) black holes can accelerate charged particles more efficiently and exhibit superior energy extraction capabilities compared with RN(-dS) black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate exact charged and uncharged black hole solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime within the framework of quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ symmetric teleparallel gravity, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. By adopting spherical symmetry and considering both vanishing and non-vanishing electromagnetic fields, we derive new classes of black hole solutions and analyze their geometric and physical properties. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of quadratic corrections in the gravitational Lagrangian significantly modifies the structure of solutions, producing deviations from the standard BTZ geometry. Invariants such as curvature and non-metricity scalars are calculated to classify the singularity structure and spacetime behavior. Thermodynamic quantities, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, are computed, showing consistency with the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic motion of test particles and derive the effective potential to explore the stability of photon orbits. A notable outcome is the identification of weaker black hole singularities in comparison to General Relativity, attributed to the non-metricity corrections. The possibility of multi-horizon configurations is also explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational, thermodynamic, and dynamical features of lower-dimensional black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlights their distinct characteristics with respect to General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.</description>

      <title>Effective matter sectors from modified entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust parameter estimation within minutes on gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star inspirals contain information on nuclear matter above saturation density. However, extracting this information and conducting parameter estimation remains a computationally challenging and expensive task. Wong et al. introduced Jim arXiv:2302.05333, a parameter estimation pipeline that combines relative binning and jax features such as hardware acceleration and automatic differentiation into a normalizing flow-enhanced sampler for gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In this work, we extend the Jim framework to analyze gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars (BNS) mergers with tidal effects included. We demonstrate that Jim can be used for full Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from BNS mergers within a few tens of minutes, which includes the training of the normalizing flow and computing the reference parameters for relative binning. For instance, Jim can analyze GW170817 in 26 minutes (33 minutes) of total wall time using the TaylorF2 (IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2) waveform, and GW190425 in around 21 minutes for both waveforms. We highlight the importance of such an efficient parameter estimation pipeline for several science cases as well as its ecologically friendly implementation of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic transport from frame-indifferent kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.</description>

      <title>Mutated hilltop inflation in light of Planck/ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated. To constrain the parameter space, we employ the latest $r-n_{\rm s}$ constraints from Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, alongside reheating parameters $N_{\rm{re}}$, $T_{\rm{re}}$, and $\omega_{\rm{re}}$, and the model independent bound on the radiation dominated (RD) era $N_{\rm{rd}}$. Furthermore, the relic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum within the sensitivity domains of future GW detectors are analyzed. By combining CMB, reheating, RD era, and GW constraints, we find for the Planck+BK18 data that the inflationary duration is confined to $46 \leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $48.1 \leq N \leq 56$ (68\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\alpha$ is confined to $0.161 \leq \alpha \leq 0.890$ (95\% CL) and $0.217 \leq \alpha \leq 0.815$ (68\% CL). Inclusion of the ACT data further tighten the constraints to $54 \leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $0.29 \leq \alpha \leq 0.62$ (95\% CL), thereby enhancing the precision and robustness of the model predictions.</description>

      <title>Possible binary neutron star merger history of the primary of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with masses between $\sim 3-5M_{\odot}$, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, can further pair up with a neutron star or BH and merge again within a Hubble time. However, the astrophysical environments in which this can happen and the rate of such mergers are open questions in astrophysics. Gravitational waves may play an important role in answering these questions. In this context, we discuss the possibility that the primary of the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary GW230529_181500 (GW230529, in short) is the product of a previous BNS merger. Invoking numerical relativity (NR)-based fitting formulas that map the binary constituents' masses and tidal deformabilities to the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BH, we investigate the potential parents of GW230529's primary. Our calculations using NR fits based on BNS simulations reveal that the remnant of a high-mass BNS merger similar to GW190425 is consistent with the primary of GW230529. This argument is further strengthened by the gravitational wave-based merger rate estimation of GW190425-like and GW230529-like populations. We show that around 18% (median) of the GW190425-like remnants could become the primary component in GW230529-like mergers. The dimensionless tidal deformability parameter of the heavier neutron star in the parent binary is constrained to $67^{+163}_{-61}$ at 90% credibility. Using estimates of the gravitational-wave kick imparted to the remnant, we also discuss the astrophysical environments in which these types of mergers can take place and the implications for their future observations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy dependence of the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy. We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ can change the bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude, which can affect both the dissipative and the conservative tidal response of neutron stars. This suggests that both conservative and dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.</description>

      <title>Leveraging differentiable programming in the inverse problem of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of two one-form topological matter fields minimally coupled to first-order gravity in three-dimensional spacetime using the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism. Working in the full phase space, we systematically identify the complete set of constraints of the system, classify them into first- and second-class, and compute their Poisson bracket algebra. The constraint analysis confirms the absence of physical degrees of freedom, consistent with the system's topological character. Furthermore, we construct the generating functional for gauge transformations and demonstrate that, with appropriate gauge parameter mappings, these transformations recover the full diffeomorphism and Poincar\'e symmetries of the theory. Finally, we explicitly compute the Dirac brackets, establishing the symplectic structure of the reduced phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present two brane-world-type solutions in a two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity model with singular space-time backgrounds. By employing a first-order superpotential formalism, we first construct the 2D analogues of the thick brane solution previously given by Gremm and analyze the corresponding linear scalar perturbations. We show that for a model with canonical scalar matter fields, the effective potential of the linear perturbation equation is a singular P\"oschl--Teller~II type, which does not admit bound states. However, for a model with non-canonical scalar fields, the effective potential becomes an exactly solvable P\"oschl--Teller~I potential, which has an infinite tower of normalizable bound states. We also present a second analytic solution inspired by the work of Girardello \emph{et al.}, but with non-canonical scalar field. In this case, the linear perturbation equation is a Schr\"odinger equation with the Eckart potential, which is also exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also find an interesting relation between the four dimensional gravitational constant and the Taub-NUT charge. The results are derived from classical field equations in Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our outcome is structured in the following sequence: (1) a general result for indefinite Finslerian manifolds with boundary $(M,L)$ showing the equivalence between local and infinitesimal (time, light or space) convexities for the boundary $\partial M$, (2) for any cone structure $(M,\mathcal{C})$ which is globally hyperbolic with timelike boundary, the equivalence among: (a) the boundary $\partial M$ is lightconvex, (b) the interior $\mathring{M}$ is causally simple and (c) the space of the cone (null) geodesics $\mathcal{N}$ of $(\mathring{M},\mathcal{C})$ is Hausdorff, (3) in this case, the manifold structure of $\mathcal{N}$ is obtained explicitly in terms of elements in $\partial M$ and a smooth Cauchy hypersurface $S$, (4) the known results and examples about Hausdorfness of $\mathcal{N}$ are revisited and extended, leading to the notion of {\em causally simple spacetime with $T_2$-lightspace} as a step in the causal ladder below global hyperbolicity.
  The results are significant for relativistic (Lorentz) spacetimes and the writing allows one either to be introduced in Finslerian technicalities or to skip them. In particular, asymptotically AdS spacetimes become examples where the $C^{1,1}$ conformal extensions at infinity yield totally lightgeodesic boundaries, and all the results above apply.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ``complexity equals anything" proposal with codimension-one and codimension-zero gravitational observables for multi-horizon black holes, using the Bardeen-AdS class black hole as an example. In particular, we compare the results with the ``complexity equals volume" (CV) proposal and find that the ``complexity equals anything" ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{gen}}$) enables the probing of a more complete black hole interior, that is, all spacetime regions where the blackening factor $f(r)&lt;0$. This is the advantage brought by the flexibility of this holographic complexity conjecture. In addition, we compute the complexity derived from various geometric quantities and show that these constructions can effectively differentiate the distinct interior regions of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11758v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed. [abridged]</description>

      <title>A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak</title>

Abstract: One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1&lt;20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical mergers, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a Binary Black Hole Merger with Total Mass 190-265 $M_{\odot}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+23}_{-18}\, M_\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50}\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.40^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$20.7. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.52}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\sim$200 $M_\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present evidence for evolving dark energy using baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), combined with different Type Ia supernova calibrations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5YR, and Union3) and the CMB compressed likelihood. In our analysis, we examined several dark energy models, including the Logarithmic, Exponential, CPL, BA, JBP, Thawing, Mirage, and GEDE parameterizations. We found that the evidence for evolving dark energy in the DESI measurements is primarily driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers, as their combination yields a preferred value of $\omega_0 &gt; -1$. Further extending our analysis by combining other measurements, we find that all evolving dark energy models favor evolving dark energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$ (Quintom-B). Indeed, our results show a departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model at a significance level of up to $3$-$3.6\sigma$, with the DES-SN5YR sample showing the most significant deviation. When we exclude low-$z$ SNe Ia measurements from the DES-SN5YR sample, we find that the preference for evolving dark energy is significantly biased by the low-redshift ($z &lt; 0.01$) supernova sample. The evolution of $\omega(z)$ shows a phantom crossing around $z \sim 0.5$ in most of the dynamical dark energy models, and the evolution of $f_{DE}(z)$ further supports the evolving nature of dark energy. Bayesian analysis of model evidence shows that the inclusion of low-$z$ supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-$z$ data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Mass/Charge Relation and Weak No-hair Theorem Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to two Maxwell fields and one (real) dilaton scalar. We study the electrically-charged spherically-symmetric and static solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. General solutions are described by four independent parameters: mass $M$, two electric charges $(Q_1,Q_2)$ and the scalar charge $\Sigma$. For black holes, the scalar charge is not independent, but a function of $(M,Q_1,Q_2)$. We provide a set of formulae relating the mass to the charges, which allows us to determine $\Sigma(M,Q_1,Q_2)$ without having to solve the black hole equations. Our results confirm the weaker version of the no-hair theorem conjecture involving one real scalar: it can be turned on in a black hole, but it does not have a continuous independent hairy parameter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational implications of black holes in toroidal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and observational implications for the charged torus-like black holes, a class of solutions distinct from the classical Schwarzschild black holes. We explicitly derive the fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, P-V diagram, isothermal compressibility, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy, under different entropy models. We find that only the exponential corrected entropy demonstrates multiple phase transitions, which we validate with the Ricci Scalar divergence obtained from the Ruppeiner formalism. This indicates that exponential corrected entropy is more sensitive to BH's microstructure as compared to the Hawking-Bekenstein and R\`{e}nyi entropy models. In addition, we study the sparsity and emission rates of Hawking radiation, demonstrating that exponential correction entropy yields more consistent and stable behavior. In our observational analysis, we graphically demonstrate the behavior of redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shift, and identify specific conditions where the photon sphere radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which depends on the values of parameters such as electric charge and cosmological constant. The novel insight of this work is that despite this violation, our computed redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shifts fall within the range of the observational data of NGC 4258 and UGC 3789.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic properties in soliton field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface providing surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resembles a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids, providing a field theory description for hydrodynamics with interfaces.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Black hole interiors of homogeneous holographic solids under shear strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</description>

      <title>8D conformal gravity with Einstein sector, and its relation to the Q-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first streamline the construction of the unique six-dimensional conformal gravity action found by L\"u, Pang and Pope, that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations. We then prove that there exists a unique eight-dimensional conformal gravity action that admits Einstein metrics as solutions to the field equations, and explicitly build the corresponding action. Finally, we relate these results to Branson's Q-curvature and the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor, to conclude that on every even-dimensional space there exists a unique -- up to boundary terms -- conformally-invariant gravity theory that is extremised by Einstein metrics.</description>
