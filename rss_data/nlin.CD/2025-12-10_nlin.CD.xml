      <title>Transcript-based estimators for characterizing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of transcripts was introduced in 2009 as a means to characterize various aspects of the functional relationship between time series of interacting systems. Based on this concept that utilizes algebraic relations between ordinal patterns derived from time series, estimators for the strength, direction, and complexity of interactions have been introduced. These estimators, however, have not yet found widespread application in studies of interactions between real-world systems. Here, we revisit the concept of transcripts and showcase the usage of transcript-based estimators for a time-series-based investigation of interactions between coupled paradigmatic dynamical systems of varying complexity. At the example of a time-resolved analysis of multichannel and multiday recordings of ongoing human brain dynamics, we demonstrate the potential of the methods to provide novel insights into the intricate spatial-temporal interactions in the human brain underlying different vigilance states.</description>

      <title>Frequency Locking to Environmental Forcing Suppresses Oscillatory Extinction in Phage-Bacteria Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteriophage-bacteria interactions are central to microbial ecology, influencing evolution, biogeochemical cycles, and pathogen behavior. Most theoretical models assume static environments and passive bacterial hosts, neglecting the joint effects of bacterial traits and environmental fluctuations on coexistence dynamics. This limitation hinders the prediction of microbial persistence in dynamic ecosystems such as soils and oceans.Using a minimal ordinary differential equation framework, we show that the bacterial growth rate and the phage adsorption rate collectively determine three possible ecological outcomes: phage extinction, stable coexistence, or oscillation-induced extinction. Specifically, we demonstrate that environmental fluctuations can suppress destructive oscillations through resonance, promoting coexistence where static models otherwise predict collapse. Counterintuitively, we find that lower bacterial growth rates are helpful in enhancing survival under high infection pressure, elucidating the observed post-infection growth reduction.Our studies reframe bacterial hosts as active builders of ecological dynamics and environmental variation as a potential stabilizing force. Our findings thus bridge a key theory-experiment gap and provide a foundational framework for predicting microbial responses to environmental stress, which might have potential implications for phage therapy, microbiome management, and climate-impacted community resilience.</description>

      <title>Stretching and breaking of particles in compressible random flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key feature of turbulent suspensions that involve floating particles on the surface or inertial particles in the bulk is the compressibility of the effective particle-phase velocity field. Little, however, is known about the effects of small-scale flow compressibility on the stretching and breaking of particles. Here, we gain insight into the nature of these effects by studying the deformation of tiny particles in model fluctuating flows. We consider a generic particle with extensional dynamics that are governed by a vector model, which accounts for elasticity, internal viscosity, and non-affine deformation. Applying the dynamical systems approach of Balkovsky, Fouxon &amp; Lebedev (2000), we first obtain general results for the stationary statistics of particle extension in compressible chaotic flows. We then specialize to a time-decorrelated Gaussian random flow and derive an exact solution for the Batchelor regime of the compressible Kraichnan model. We also perform numerical simulations for a time-correlated renewing flow. While straining is suppressed on the average in compressible flows, our results show that large deviations of the strain rate strongly stretch particles and give rise to a power-law distribution of extensions. Extreme straining events are particularly important for stiff particles and, in the examples considered here, give rise to a counter-intuitive effect: stiff particles stretch more and break faster in flows of increasing compressibility. Highly-elastic particles, whose deformation is dictated by the mean straining, stretch less and break slower. Though based on specific random flows, our work shows how compressibility can affect the extensional dynamics of particles by altering the fluctuations of the strain rate, including its large deviations.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and synthetic Koopman analyses of cat maps onto classical 2-tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical continuous automorphisms of the torus (cat maps) from the viewpoint of the Koopman theory. We find analytical formulae for Koopman modes defined coherently on the whole of the torus, and their decompositions associated with the partition of the torus into ergodic components. The spectrum of the Koopman operator is studied in four cases of cat maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical (transition from quasi-cyclic to chaotic behaviour) and chaotic. The synthetic spectrum associated with the ergodic decomposition is also studied.</description>

      <title>Scaling invariance for the diffusion coefficient in a billiard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the unbounded diffusion observed in a time-dependent oval-shaped billiard and its suppression owing to inelastic collisions with the boundary. The main focus is on the behavior of the diffusion coefficient, which plays a key role in describing the scaling invariance characteristic of this transition. For short times, the low-action regime is characterized by a constant diffusion coefficient, which begins to decay after a crossover iteration, thereby suppressing the unlimited growth of velocity. We demonstrate that this behavior is scaling-invariant concerning the control parameters and can be described by a homogeneous generalized function and its associated scaling laws. The critical exponents are determined both phenomenologically and analytically, including the decay exponent beta = -1, previously identified in the diffusion coefficient of the dissipative standard map.</description>
