      <title>Automatic EEG Independent Component Classification Using ICLabel in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ICLabel is an important plug-in function in EEGLAB, the most widely used software for EEG data processing. A powerful approach to automated processing of EEG data involves decomposing the data by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and then classifying the resulting independent components (ICs) using ICLabel. While EEGLAB pipelines support high-performance computing (HPC) platforms running the open-source Octave interpreter, the ICLabel plug-in is incompatible with Octave because of its specialized neural network architecture. To enhance cross-platform compatibility, we developed a Python version of ICLabel that uses standard EEGLAB data structures. We compared ICLabel MATLAB and Python implementations to data from 14 subjects. ICLabel returns the likelihood of classification in 7 classes of components for each ICA component. The returned IC classifications were virtually identical between Python and MATLAB, with differences in classification percentage below 0.001%.</description>

      <title>Collective decision making by embodied neural agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective decision making using simple social interactions has been studied in many types of multi-agent systems, including robot swarms and human social networks. However, existing multi-agent studies have rarely modeled the neural dynamics that underlie sensorimotor coordination in embodied biological agents. In this study, we investigated collective decisions that resulted from sensorimotor coordination among agents with simple neural dynamics. We equipped our agents with a model of minimal neural dynamics based on the coordination dynamics framework, and embedded them in an environment with a stimulus gradient. In our single-agent setup, the decision between two stimulus sources depends solely on the coordination of the agent's neural dynamics with its environment. In our multi-agent setup, that same decision also depends on the sensorimotor coordination between agents, via their simple social interactions. Our results show that the success of collective decisions depended on a balance of intra-agent, inter-agent, and agent-environment coupling, and we use these results to identify the influences of environmental factors on decision difficulty. More generally, our results demonstrate the impact of intra- and inter-brain coordination dynamics on collective behavior, can contribute to existing knowledge on the functional role of inter-agent synchrony, and are relevant to ongoing developments in neuro-AI and self-organized multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Analysis of Brain Responses in Multi-Modal Human-Robot Interaction: Modulating Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User engagement, cognitive participation, and motivation during task execution in physical human-robot interaction are crucial for motor learning. These factors are especially important in contexts like robotic rehabilitation, where neuroplasticity is targeted. However, traditional robotic rehabilitation systems often face challenges in maintaining user engagement, leading to unpredictable therapeutic outcomes. To address this issue, various techniques, such as assist-as-needed controllers, have been developed to prevent user slacking and encourage active participation. In this paper, we introduce a new direction through a novel multi-modal robotic interaction designed to enhance user engagement by synergistically integrating visual, motor, cognitive, and auditory (speech recognition) tasks into a single, comprehensive activity. To assess engagement quantitatively, we compared multiple electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers between this multi-modal protocol and a traditional motor-only protocol. Fifteen healthy adult participants completed 100 trials of each task type. Our findings revealed that EEG biomarkers, particularly relative alpha power, showed statistically significant improvements in engagement during the multi-modal task compared to the motor-only task. Moreover, while engagement decreased over time in the motor-only task, the multi-modal protocol maintained consistent engagement, suggesting that users could remain engaged for longer therapy sessions. Our observations on neural responses during interaction indicate that the proposed multi-modal approach can effectively enhance user engagement, which is critical for improving outcomes. This is the first time that objective neural response highlights the benefit of a comprehensive robotic intervention combining motor, cognitive, and auditory functions in healthy subjects.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</title>

Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.</description>

      <title>Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN.</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>
