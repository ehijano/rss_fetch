      <title>A note on the sizes of bipartite 1-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is 1-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. Let G be a bipartite 1-planar graph with partite sets X and Y. A 1-disk OX drawing of G is a 1-planar drawing such that all vertices of X lie on the boundary of O and all vertices of Y and all edges of G locate in the interior of O, where O is a disk on the plane. The concept was first proposed by Huang, Ouyang and Dong when they solved a conjecture about the edge density of bipartite 1-planar graphs. Additionally, they presented a problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with a 1-disk OX drawing. In this paper, we solve this problem and prove that every bipartite graph G which has a 1-disk OX drawing has at most 2|V(G)|+|X|-6 edges. Moreover, we demonstrate that this upper bound is tight.</description>

      <title>The number of regular simplices in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extremal function $S^k_d(n)$, defined as the maximum number of regular $(k-1)$-simplices spanned by $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For any fixed $d\geq2k\geq6$, we determine the asymptotic behavior of $S^k_d(n)$ up to a multiplicative constant in the lower-order term. In particular, when $k=3$, we determine the exact value of $S^3_d(n)$, for all even dimensions $d\geq6$ and sufficiently large $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s in a stronger form. The proof leverages techniques from hypergraph Tur\'an theory and linear algebra.</description>

      <title>A Note on Edge Coalitions in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haynes et al. (2020) introduced and investigated the concept of coalition in graphs \cite{hhhmm1}. Their study examined this concept from a vertex-based perspective, whereas in this paper, we extend the investigation to an edge-based perspective of graphs. \\ An edge coalition in a graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of two disjoint sets of edges $E_1$ and $E_2$, neither of which individually forms an edge dominating set, but whose union $E_1\cup E_2$ is an edge dominating set. An edge coalition partition in a graph $G$ of order $n=|V|$ and size $|E|=m$ is an edge partition $\pi=\{E_1,\cdots,E_k\}$ so that every set $E_i$ of $\pi$ either is a singleton edge dominating set, or is not an edge dominating set but forms an edge coalition with another set $E_j$ in $\pi$, which is also not an edge dominating set.
  In this paper, we introduce the concept of an edge coalition and demonstrate its existence in particular graphs and trees. Additionally, we characterize graphs with small number of edge coalitions and analyze edge coalition structures in various special graph classes.</description>

      <title>Finite Interpretations of a Hyper-Catalan Series Solution to Polynomial Equations and Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution to the general univariate polynomial equation has been sought for centuries. It is well known there is no general solution in radicals for degrees five and above.
  The hyper-Catalan numbers $C[m_2,m_3,m_4,\ldots]$ count the ways to subdivide a planar polygon into exactly $m_2$ triangles, $m_3$ quadrilaterals, $m_4$ pentagons, etc. Wildberger and Rubine (2025) show the generating series $\mathbf{S}$ of the hyper-Catalan numbers is a formal series zero of the general geometric polynomial (meaning, general except for a constant of $1$ and a linear coefficient of $-1$).
  Using a variant of the series solution to the geometric polynomial that has the number of vertices, edges, and faces explicitly shown, We prove their infinite series result may be viewed as a finite identity at each level, where a level is a truncation of $\mathbf{S}$ to a given maximum number of vertices, edges, or faces (bounded by degree).
  We illustrate this result, as well as the general correspondence between operations on sets of subdivided polygons and the algebra of polynomials, with figures and animations generated using Python.</description>

      <title>Type R $\lambda$-Permutation Approach to Velleman's Open Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, mathematicians Steven Krantz and Jeffery McNeal studied a type of positive numbers permutation called $\lambda$-permutation. This type of permutation, when applied to the index of terms of a series, is defined to be both convergence-preserving and "fixing" at least one divergent series, that is, rearranging the terms of any convergent series will result in a convergent series, while rearranging the terms of some divergent series will result in a convergent series. In general, if a divergent series can be fixed to converge in some way (it does not need to be by $\lambda$-permutation), it is called a "conditionally divergent series". In 2006, another mathematician Daniel Velleman raised an open problem related to $\lambda$-permutation: for a conditionally divergent series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n,n\in \mathbb{N},a_n\in \mathbb{R}$, let $S=\{L \in \mathbb{R} \colon L = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{a_{\sigma\left(n\right)}}$ $\text{for some } \lambda\text{-permutation } \sigma\}$, can $S$ ever be something between $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}$? This paper is devoted to partially answering this open problem by considering a subset of $\lambda$-permutation constraint by how we can permute, named type R $\lambda$-permutation. Then we answer the analogous question about a subset of S with respect to type R $\lambda$-permutation, named $Z_{R}=\{L \in \mathbb{R} \colon L = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{a_{\sigma\left(n\right)}}$ $\text{for some type R } \lambda \text{-permutation } \sigma\}$. We show that $Z_R$ is either $\emptyset$, a singleton or $\mathbb{R}$. We also provide sufficient conditions on the conditionally divergent series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n$ for $Z_R$ to be a singleton or $\mathbb{R}$, by introducing a "substantial property" on the series.</description>

      <title>Rook decomposition of the Partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rook numbers are fairly well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we study the max-rook number of the Ferrers boards associated to integer partitions. We show its connections with the Durfee triangle of the partitions. The max-rook number gives a new decomposition of the partition function. We derive the generating functions of the partitions with the Durfee triangle of sizes $3$, $4$ and $5$. We obtain their exact formula and further use it to show the periodicity modulo $p$ for any $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p\geq2$. We also establish their parity and parity bias. We give the growth asymptotics of partitions with the Durfee triangle of sizes $3$ and $4$. We obtain a new rook analogue of the recurrence relation of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous substructures in random ordered hyper-matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordered $r$-uniform matching of size $n$ is a collection of $n$ pairwise disjoint $r$-subsets of a linearly ordered set of $rn$ vertices. For $n=2$, such a matching is called an $r$-pattern, as it represents one of $\tfrac12\binom{2r}r$ ways two disjoint edges may intertwine. Given a set $\mathcal{P}$ of $r$-patterns, a $\mathcal{P}$-clique is a matching with all pairs of edges order-isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{P}$.
  In this paper we are interested in the size of a largest $\mathcal{P}$-clique in a random ordered $r$-uniform matching selected uniformly from all such matchings on a fixed vertex set $[rn]$.
  We determine this size (up to multiplicative constants) for several sets $\mathcal{P}$, including all sets of size $|\mathcal{P}|\le2$, the set $\mathcal{R}^{(r)}$ of all $r$-partite patterns, as well as sets $\mathcal{P}$ enjoying a Boolean-like, symmetric structure.</description>

      <title>Structured Sunflowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call an infinite structure $\mathcal{M}$ sunflowerable if whenever $\mathcal{M}'$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$ with underlying set $M'$, consisting of finite sets of bounded size, there is an $M_0 \subseteq M'$ such that $M_0$ is a sunflower and $\mathcal{M}'\!\!\upharpoonright[M_0]$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$. We give sufficient conditions on $\mathcal{M}$ to show that $\mathcal{M}$ is sunflowerable. These conditions allow us to show that several well-known structures are sunflowerable and give a complete characterization of the countable linear orderings which are sunflowerable. We show that a sunflowerable structure must be indivisible. This allows us to show that any Fra\"iss\'e limit which has the 3-disjoint amalgamation property and a single unary type must be indivisible. In addition to studying sunflowerability of infinite structures, we also consider an analogous property of an age which we call the sunflower property. We show that any sunflowerable structure must have an age with the sunflower property. We also give concrete bounds in the case that the age has the hereditary property, the 3-disjoint amalgamation property, and is indivisible.</description>

      <title>Distribution of new statistics of parking functions and their generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present new results on the enumeration of parking functions and labeled forests. We introduce new statistics on parking functions, which are then extended to labeled forests via bijective correspondences. We determine the joint distribution of two statistics on parking functions and their counterparts on labeled forests. Our results on labeled forests also serve to explain the mysterious equidistribution between two seemingly unrelated statistics in parking functions recently identified by Stanley and Yin and give an explicit bijection between the two statistics. Extensions of our techniques are discussed, including joint distribution on further refinement of these new statistics.</description>

      <title>New bounds for linear arboricity and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear forest is a collection of vertex-disjoint paths. The Linear Arboricity Conjecture states that every graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be decomposed into at most $\lceil(\Delta+1)/2\rceil$ linear forests. We prove that $\Delta/2 + \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ linear forests suffice, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the graph. If $\Delta = \Omega(n^\varepsilon)$, this is an exponential improvement over the previous best error term. We achieve this by generalising P\'osa rotations from rotations of one endpoint of a path to simultaneous rotations of multiple endpoints of a linear forest. This method has further applications, including the resolution of a conjecture of Feige and Fuchs on spanning linear forests with few paths and the existence of optimally short tours in connected regular graphs.</description>

      <title>An introduction to the symmetric group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an introduction to the group algebras of the symmetric groups, written for a quarter-long graduate course. After recalling the definition of group algebras (and monoid algebras) in general, as well as basic properties of permutations, we introduce several families of elements in the symmetric group algebras $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ such as the Young--Jucys--Murphy elements, the (sign-)integrals and the conjugacy class sums. Then comes a chapter on group actions and representations in general, followed by the core of this text: a study of the representations of symmetric groups (i.e., of left $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$-modules), including the classical theory of Young tableaux and Young symmetrizers. We prove in detail the main facts including the characterization of irreducible representations (in characteristic $0$), the Garnir relations, the standard basis theorem, the description of duals of Specht modules, and the hook length formula, as well as a number of less known results. Finally, we describe several bases of $\mathbf{k}[S_n]$ that arise from the study of Specht modules, including the Murphy cellular bases.
  The methods used are elementary and computational. We aim to assume as little as possible of the base ring $\mathbf{k}$, and to use as little as possible from representation theory (nothing more advanced than Maschke and Jordan--H\"older).
  Over 100 exercises (without solutions) are scattered through the text.</description>

      <title>Marked multi-colorings and marked chromatic polynomials of hypergraphs and subspace arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concepts of marked multi-colorings, marked chromatic polynomials, and marked (multivariate) independence series for hypergraphs. We show that the coefficients of the q-th power of the marked independence series of a hypergraph coincide with its marked chromatic polynomials in q, thereby generalizing a corresponding result for graphs established in Chaithra et al. 2025 (arXiv:2503.11230). These notions are then naturally extended to subspace arrangements. In particular, we prove that the number of marked multi q-colorings of a subspace arrangement is a polynomial in q. We also define the (marked) independence series for subspace arrangements and prove that the (-q)-th power of the independence series of a hyperplane arrangement has non-negative coefficients. We further conjecture that the (-q)-th power of the independence series of a hypergraph has non-negative coefficients if and only if all its edges have even cardinality.</description>

      <title>A $\sigma$-morphic convex protoset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a tile is $\sigma$-morphic if it tiles the plane in exactly $\aleph_0$ many noncongruent ways (up to an isometry). It is an unsolved problem of whether a $\sigma$-morphic tile exist in the plane. In this note we present a construction of a set of convex tiles that is $\sigma$-morphic. The result is interesting since all the constructions of $\sigma$-morphic sets of tiles that arise in the literature make use of bumps and nicks, which necessarily make the tiles non-convex. We construct our set by cleverly dividing the tiles of the set of tiles discovered by Schmitt into convex tiles so that they behave in the same manner.</description>

      <title>General Strong Bound on the Uncrossed Number which is Tight for the Edge Crossing Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a very recent concept for visualizing various aspects of a graph in the plane using a collection of drawings introduced by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik [GD 2023]. Formally, given a graph $G$, we aim to find an uncrossed collection containing drawings of $G$ in the plane such that each edge of $G$ is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. The uncrossed number of $G$ ($unc(G)$) is the smallest integer $k$ such that an uncrossed collection for $G$ of size $k$ exists. The uncrossed number is lower-bounded by the well-known thickness, which is an edge-decomposition of $G$ into planar graphs. This connection gives a trivial lower-bound $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6}\rceil \le unc(G)$. In a recent paper, Balko, Hlin\v{e}n\'y, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Orthaber, Vogtenhuber, and Wagner [GD 2024] presented the first non-trivial and general lower-bound on the uncrossed number. We summarize it in terms of dense graphs (where $|E(G)|=\epsilon(|V(G)|)^2$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$): $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c_\epsilon|V(G)|}\rceil \le unc(G)$, where $c_\epsilon\ge 2.82$ is a constant depending on $\epsilon$.
  We improve the lower-bound to state that $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6-\sqrt{2|E(G)|}+\sqrt{6(|V(G)|-2)}}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Translated to dense graphs regime, the bound yields a multiplicative constant $c'_\epsilon=3-\sqrt{(2-\epsilon)}$ in the expression $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c'_\epsilon|V(G)|+o(|V(G)|)}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Hence, it is tight (up to low-order terms) for $\epsilon \approx \frac{1}{2}$ as warranted by complete graphs.
  In fact, we formulate our result in the language of the maximum uncrossed subgraph number, that is, the maximum number of edges of $G$ that are not crossed in a drawing of $G$ in the plane. In that case, we also provide a construction certifying that our bound is asymptotically tight (up to low-order terms) on dense graphs for all $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>An identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers with arithmetic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a combinatorial identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers arising from the study of peak algebra that was conjectured by Aliniaeifard and Li. This identity leads to the discovery of the intriguing identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{2n\choose 2k+1}2^{2n-2k}(-1)^{k}E_{2k+1}=2^{2n+1}, $$ where $E_{2k+1}$ denote the tangent numbers. Interestingly, the latter identity can be applied to prove that $(n + 1)E_{2n+1}$ is divisible by $2^{2n}$ and the quotient is an odd number, a fact whose traditional proofs require significant calculations. Moreover, we find a natural $q$-analog of the latter identity with a combinatorial proof.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a technique, based on Angluin's algorithm, for automatically generating finite automata for various kinds of useful first-order logic formulas in B\"uchi arithmetic. Construction in this way can be faster and use much less space than more direct methods. We discuss the theory and we present some empirical data for the free software Walnut.</description>

      <title>Comparing the face rings of a boolean complex and its barycentric subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between the Stanley-Reisner ring (a.k.a. face ring) of a simplicial or boolean complex $\Delta$ and that of its barycentric subdivision. These rings share a distinguished parameter subring. S. Murai asked if they are isomorphic, equivariantly with respect to the automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(\Delta)$, as modules over this parameter subring. We show that, in general, the answer is no, but for Cohen-Macaulay complexes in characteristic coprime to $|\operatorname{Aut}(\Delta)|$, it is yes, and we give an explicit construction of an isomorphism. To give this construction, we adapt and generalize a pair of tools introduced by A. Garsia in 1980. The first one transfers bases from a Stanley-Reisner ring to closely related rings of which it is a Gr\"obner degeneration, and the second identifies bases to transfer.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimate for discrete Schr\"odinger equation on layered King's grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20142v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the sharp \( l^1 \to l^{\infty} \) decay estimate for the discrete Schr\"odinger equation (DS) on the Layered King's Grid (LKG), with a dispersive decay rate of \( \langle t \rangle^{-13/12} \), which is faster than that for $3$-dimensional lattice (\( \langle t \rangle^{-1} \), see \cite{SK05}). This decay estimate enables us to derive the corresponding Strichartz estimate via the standard Keel--Tao argument. Our approach relies on using techniques from Newton polyhedra to analyze singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Latin squares are a generalization of classical Latin squares in quantum field and have wide applications in unitary error bases, mutually unbiased bases, $k$-uniform states and quantum error correcting codes. In this paper, we put forward some new quantum Latin squares with special properties, such as idempotent quantum Latin square, self-orthogonal quantum Latin square, holey quantum Latin square, and the notions of orthogonality on them. We present some forceful construction methods including PBD constructions and filling in holes constructions for non-classical quantum Latin squares. As consequences, we establish the existence of non-classical 2-idempotent MOQLS$(v)$, non-classical 2, 3-MOQLS$(v)$ and non-classical SOQLS$(v)$ except possibly for several definite values.</description>

      <title>Proofs of Two Conjectural Identities on Partial Nahm Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Wang and Zeng investigated modularity of partial Nahm sums and discovered 14 modular families of such sums. They confirmed modularity for 13 families and proposed a conjecture consisting of two Rogers--Ramanujan type identities for the remaining family. We prove these conjectural identities in two steps. First, employing a transformation formula involving two Bailey pairs, we transform the partial Nahm sums into some specific Hecke-type series. Second, using two distinct approaches, we convert these Hecke-type series to the desired modular infinite products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical) limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.</description>

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</description>

      <title>The Coverage Depth Problem in DNA Storage Over Small Alphabets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coverage depth problem in DNA data storage is about minimizing the expected number of reads until all data is recovered. When they exist, MDS codes offer the best performance in this context. This paper focuses on the scenario where the base field is not large enough to allow the existence of MDS codes. We investigate the performance for the coverage depth problem of codes defined over a small finite field, providing closed formulas for the expected number of reads for various code families. We also compare the results with the theoretical bounds in asymptotic regimes. The techniques we apply range from probability, to duality theory and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Potential Theory and the Boundary of Combinatorial Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite, connected graph. We investigate a notion of boundary $\partial G \subseteq V$ and argue that it is well behaved from the point of view of potential theory. This is done by proving a number of discrete analogous of classical results for compact domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. These include (1) an analogue of P\'olya's result that a random walk in $\Omega$ typically hits the boundary $\partial \Omega$ within $\lesssim \mbox{diam}(\Omega)^2$ units of time, (2) an analogue of the Faber-Krahn inequality, (3) an analogue of the Hardy inequality, (4) an analogue of the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate, (5) a stability estimate for hot spots and (6) a Theorem of Bj\"orck stating that probability measures $\mu$ that maximize $\int_{\Omega \times \Omega} \|x-y\|^{\alpha} d\mu(x) d\mu(y)$ are fully supported in the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We first obtain explicit upper bounds for the proportion of elements in a finite classical group G with a given characteristic polynomial. We use this to complete the proof that the proportion of elements of a finite classical group G which lie in a proper irreducible subgroup tends to 0 as the dimension of the natural module goes to infinity. This result is analogous to the result of Luczak and Pyber [15] that the proportion of elements of the symmetric group S_n which are contained in a proper transitive subgroup other than the alternating group goes to 0 as n goes to infinity. We also show that the probability that 3 random elements of SL(n,q) invariably generate goes to 0 as n goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two second order free random variables $a$ and $b$, we study the second order free cumulants of their product $ab$, their commutator $ab-ba$, and their anti-commutator $ab+ba$. Let $(\kappa_n^a)_{n\geq 1}$ and $(\kappa_{n,m}^a)_{n,m\geq 1}$ denote the sequence of free cumulants of first and second order, respectively, of a random variable $a$ in a second order non-commutative probability space $(\mathcal{A},\varphi,\varphi^2)$. Given $a$ and $b$ two second order freely independent random variables, we provide formulas to compute each of the cumulants $(\kappa_{n,m}^{ab})_{n,m\geq 1}$, $(\kappa_{n,m}^{ab-ba})_{n,m\geq 1}$, and $(\kappa_{n,m}^{ab+ba})_{n,m\geq 1}$ in terms of the individual cumulants $(\kappa_{n}^{a})_{n\geq 1}$, $(\kappa_{n,m}^{a})_{n,m\geq 1}$, $(\kappa_{n}^{b})_{n\geq 1}$, and $(\kappa_{n,m}^{b})_{n,m\geq 1}$. For $n=m=1$ our formulas read: \begin{align*} \kappa_{1,1}^{ab} &amp;= \kappa_{2}^{a}\kappa_{2}^{b} +\kappa_{1,1}^{a}(\kappa_{1}^{b})^2+\kappa_{1,1}^{b}(\kappa_{1}^{a})^2,\\ \kappa_{1,1}^{ab-ba} &amp;= 2\kappa_{2}^{a}\kappa_{2}^{b},\\ \kappa_{1,1}^{ab+ba} &amp;= 2\kappa_{2}^{a}\kappa_{2}^{b} +4\kappa_{1,1}^{a}(\kappa_{1}^{b})^2+4\kappa_{1,1}^{b}(\kappa_{1}^{a})^2. \end{align*}
  In general, our formulas express the cumulants $\kappa_{n,m}^{ab}$, $\kappa_{n,m}^{ab-ba}$, and $\kappa_{n,m}^{ab+ba}$ as sums indexed by special subsets of non-crossing partitioned permutations. The formulas for the commutator and anti-commutator where not studied before, while the formula for the product was only known in the case the where the individual second order free cumulants vanish. As an application, we compute explicitly the cumulants of the anti-commutator and product of two second order free semicircular variables.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for obtaining congruences modulo powers of a prime number~$p$ for combinatorial sequences whose generating function satisfies an algebraic differential equation. This method generalises the one by Kauers and the authors [Electron. J. Combin. 8(2) (2012), Art. P37; arXiv:1107.2015] from $p=2$ to arbitrary primes. Our applications include congruences for numbers of non-crossing graphs and numbers of Kreweras walks modulo powers of~$3$, as well as congruences for Fu\ss-Catalan numbers and blossom tree numbers modulo powers of arbitrary primes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and consider a multipartite graph $G$ with maximum degree at most $(1-\varepsilon)n$, parts $V_1,\ldots,V_k$ of the same size $n$, and where every vertex has at most $o(n)$ neighbors in any part $V_i$. Loh and Sudakov proved that any such $G$ has an independent transversal. They further conjectured that the vertex set of $G$ can be decomposed into pairwise disjoint independent transversals. In the present paper, we resolve this conjecture approximately by showing that $G$ contains $(1-\varepsilon)n$ pairwise disjoint independent transversals. As applications, we give approximate answers to questions of Yuster, and of Fischer, K\"uhn, and Osthus.</description>

      <title>Colored Multiset Eulerian Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colored multiset Eulerian polynomials are a common generalization of MacMahon's multiset Eulerian polynomials and the colored Eulerian polynomials, both of which are known to satisfy well-studied distributional properties including real-rootedness, log-concavity and unimodality. The symmetric colored multiset Eulerian polynomials are characterized and used to prove sufficient conditions for a colored multiset Eulerian polynomial to be self-interlacing. The latter property implies the aforementioned distributional properties as well as others, including the alternatingly increasing property and bi-$\gamma$-positivity. To derive these results, multivariate generalizations of an identity due to MacMahon are deduced. The results are applied to a pair of questions, both previously studied in several special cases, that are seen to admit more general answers when framed in the context of colored multiset Eulerian polynomials. The first question pertains to $s$-Eulerian polynomials, and the second to interpretations of $\gamma$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>Desarrangements revisited: statistics and pattern avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A desarrangement is a permutation whose first ascent is even. Desarrangements were introduced in the 1980s by Jacques D\'{e}sarm\'{e}nien, who proved that they are in bijection with derangements. We revisit the study of desarrangements, focusing on two themes: the refined enumeration of desarrangements with respect to permutation statistics, and pattern avoidance in desarrangements. Our main results include generating function formulas for counting desarrangements by the number of descents, peaks, valleys, double ascents, and double descents, as well as a complete enumeration of desarrangements avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. We find new interpretations of the Catalan, Fine, Jacobsthal, and Fibonacci numbers in terms of pattern-avoiding desarrangements.</description>

      <title>Canon Permutation Posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A permutation of the multiset $\{1^m,2^m,\dots,n^m\}$ is a {\em canon permutation} if the subsequence formed by the $j$th copy of each element of $[n]:=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is identical for all $j\in[m]$. Canon permutations were introduced by Elizalde and are motivated by pattern-avoiding concepts such as (quasi-)Stirling permutations. He proved that the descent polynomial of canon permutations exhibits a surprising product structure; as a further consequence, it is palindromic. Our goal is to understand canon permutations from the viewpoint of Stanley's $(P,\omega)$-partitions, along the way generalizing Elizalde's definition and results. We start with a labeled poset $P$ and extend it in a natural way to canon labelings of the product poset $P \times [n]$. The resulting descent polynomial has a product structure which arises naturally from the theory of $(P,\omega)$-partitions and simplifies existing proofs. When $P$ is graded, this theory also implies palindromicity. We include results on weak descent polynomials, an amphibian construction between canon permutations and multiset permutations, giving rise to \emph{dissonant canon permutations}, as well as $\gamma$-positivity and interpretations of descent polynomials of canon permutations.</description>

      <title>New developments on graph sum index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a graph, we assign distinct integers to the vertices, and take the sum of two integers if they are on two adjacent vertices. The minimum possible number of different sums is the \emph{sum index} of this graph. In this paper, we present some new developments on graph sum index. First, we explain the connections between graph sum index and results in additive combinatorics. Then, we determine the sum indices of the complete multipartite graphs, hypercubes, and some cluster graphs. Also, we study the maximum number of edges in a graph with a fixed sum index, which is related to the forbidden subgraph problem.</description>

      <title>Descents and flag major index on conjugacy classes of colored permutation groups without short cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the descent and flag major index statistics on the colored permutation groups, which are wreath products of the form $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}=\mathbb{Z}_r\wr \mathfrak{S}_n$. We show that the $k$-th moments of these statistics on $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$ will coincide with the corresponding moments on all conjugacy classes without cycles of lengths $1,2,\ldots,2k$. Using this, we establish the asymptotic normality of the descent and flag major index statistics on conjugacy classes of $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$ with sufficiently long cycles. Our results generalize prior work of Fulman involving the descent and major index statistics on the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$. Our methods involve an intricate extension of Fulman's work on $\mathfrak{S}_n$ combined with the theory of the degree for a colored permutation statistic, as introduced by Campion Loth, Levet, Liu, Sundaram, and Yin.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <title>Flagged LLT polynomials, nonsymmetric plethysm, and nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plethystic transformation $f[X] \mapsto f[X/(1-t)]$ and LLT polynomials are central to the theory of symmetric Macdonald polynomials. In this work, we introduce and study nonsymmetric flagged LLT polynomials. We show that these admit both an algebraic and a combinatorial description, that they Weyl symmetrize to the usual symmetric LLT polynomials, and we conjecture that they expand positively in terms of Demazure atoms. Additionally, we construct a nonsymmetric plethysm operator $\Pi_{t,x}$ on $\mathfrak{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, which serves as an analogue of $f[X] \mapsto f[X/(1-t)]$. We prove that $\Pi_{t,x}$ remarkably maps flagged LLT polynomials defined over a signed alphabet to ones over an unsigned alphabet.
  Our main application of this theory is to formulate a nonsymmetric version of Macdonald positivity, similar in spirit to conjectures of Knop and Lapointe, but with several new features. To do this, we recast the Haglund-Haiman-Loehr formula for nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials $\mathcal{E}_{\mu }(x;q,t)$ as a positive sum of signed flagged LLT polynomials. Then, after applying a suitable stable limit of $\Pi_{t,x}$ to a stable version of $\mathcal{E}_{\mu }(x;q,t)$, we obtain modified nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials which are positive sums of flagged LLT polynomials and thus are conjecturally atom positive, strengthening the Macdonald positivity conjecture.</description>

      <title>On likelihood of a Condorcet winner for uniformly random and independent voter preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model of voting contest with $m$ voters and $n$ candidates, with each voter ranking the candidates in order of preference, without ties. A Condorcet winner is a candidate who gets more than $m/2$ votes in pairwise contest with every other candidate. An ``impartial culture'' setting is the case when each voter chooses his/her candidate preference list uniformly at random from all $n!$ preferences, and does it independently of all other voters. For impartial culture case, Robert May and Lisa Sauermann showed that when $m=2k-1$ is fixed ($k=2$ and $k&gt;2$ respectively), and $n$ grows indefinitely, the probability of a Condorcet winner is small, of order $n^{-(k-1)/k}$. We show that when $m$ grows indefinitely and $m\gg n^4$, the probability of a Condercet winner is $1-O(n^2/m^{1/2})\to 1$.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Permutation Wordle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a game of permutation wordle in which a player attempts to guess a secret permutation of length $n$ in as few guesses as possible. In each round, the guessing player is told which indices of their guessed permutation are correct. How can we optimize the player's strategy? Samuel Kutin and Lawren Smithline (arXiv:2408.00903) propose a strategy called "cyclic shift" in which all incorrect entries are shifted one index to the right in successive guesses, and they conjecture its optimality. We investigate this conjecture by formalizing what a strategy looks like, performing experimental analysis on inductively constructed strategies, and examining the coefficients of an inductive strategy's generating function.</description>

      <title>Perfect Matchings in Random Sparsifications of Dense Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decision problem of perfect matchings in uniform hypergraphs is famously an NP-complete problem. It has been shown by Keevash--Knox--Mycroft [STOC, 2013] that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, such decision problem restricted to $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ satisfying that every $(k-1)$-set of vertices is in at least $(1/k+\varepsilon)|H|$ edges is tractable, and the quantity $1/k$ is best possible. In this paper we study the existence of perfect matchings in the random $p$-sparsification of such $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, for $p=p(n)\in [0,1]$, every edge is kept with probability $p$ independent of others. As a consequence, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability solves the decision problem; we also derive effective bounds on the number of perfect matchings in such hypergraphs. At last, similar results are obtained for the $F$-factor problem in graphs.
  The key ingredients of the proofs are a strengthened partition lemma for the lattice-based absorption method, and the random redistribution method developed recently by Kelly, M\"uyesser and Pokrovskiy, based on the spread method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07301v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The commuting graph of a group $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$, two distinct vertices joined if they commute.
  Our purpose in this paper is twofold: we discuss the computational problem of deciding whether a given graph is the commuting graph of a finite group; we give a quasipolynomial algorithm, and a polynomial algorithm for the case when the group is an extra\-special p-group for p an odd prime; we give new results on the question of whether the commuting graph of a given group is a cograph or a chordal graph, two classes of graphs defined by forbidden subgraphs.
  The problems are not unrelated, since there are a number of cases where hard computational problems on graphs are easier when restricted to special classes of graphs; we conjecture that the recognition problem is polynomial for cographs and chordal graphs.</description>

We also give some lower bounds for the connectivity of polyhedral joins. We use these results to study the homotopy type of the forest filtration for some lexicographic products of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this paper concerns type C. We present new explicitly defined families of algebro-combinatorial structures of three kinds: combinatorial bases in representations, Newton--Okounkov bodies of flag varieties and toric degenerations of flag varieties. All three families are parametrized by the same family of polytopes: the marked chain-order polytopes of Fang and Fourier which interpolate between the type C Gelfand--Tsetlin and FFLV polytopes. Thus, in each case the obtained structures interpolate between the well-known bases, Newton--Okounkov bodies or degenerations associated with the latter two polytopes. We then obtain similar results for type B after introducing a new family of poset polytopes to be considered in place of marked chain-order polytopes. In both types our constructions and proofs rely crucially on a combinatorial connection between poset polytopes and pipe dreams.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons theories with defects, Rogers-Ramanujan type functions and eta-products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons (CS) theories with (special)unitary, symplectic, orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups. We find that they have several beautiful infinite product $q$-series expressions in terms of Ramanujan's general theta function. For the theories with fundamental chiral multiplets, the pairs of the Neumann half-indices and one-point functions of the fundamental Wilson lines form a basis for the line defect indices in terms of the Rogers-Ramanujan type functions. Furthermore, the theories with an adjoint chiral admit the expressions as the eta-products. In particular, for the $SU(N)_{-2N}$ CS theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the BPS boundary local operators and the $N$-core partitions.</description>

      <title>A superpotential for Grassmannian Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While mirror symmetry for flag varieties and Grassmannians has been extensively studied, Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian are singular, and hence standard mirror symmetry statements are not well-defined. Nevertheless, in this article we introduce a ``superpotential'' $W^{\lambda}$ for each Grassmannian Schubert variety $X_{\lambda}$, generalizing the Marsh-Rietsch superpotential for Grassmannians, and we show that $W^{\lambda}$ governs many toric degenerations of $X_{\lambda}$. We also generalize the ``polytopal mirror theorem'' for Grassmannians from our previous work: namely, for any cluster seed $G$ for $X_{\lambda}$, we construct a corresponding Newton-Okounkov convex body $\Delta_G^{\lambda}$, and show that it coincides with the superpotential polytope $\Gamma_G^{\lambda}$, that is, it is cut out by the inequalities obtained by tropicalizing an associated Laurent expansion of $W^{\lambda}$. This gives us a toric degeneration of the Schubert variety $X_{\lambda}$ to the (singular) toric variety $Y(\mathcal{N}_{\lambda})$ of the Newton-Okounkov body. Finally, for a particular cluster seed $G=G^\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ we show that the toric variety $Y(\mathcal{N}_{\lambda})$ has a small toric desingularisation, and we describe an intermediate partial desingularisation $Y(\mathcal{F}_\lambda)$ that is Gorenstein Fano. Many of our results extend to more general varieties in the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Dimension of Diophantine approximation and some applications in harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of sets via Diophantine approximation, in which the classical examples are endpoints.
  Our first application is on their Hausdorff dimension. We show a recent result of Ren and Wang, known sharp on orthogonal projections in the plane, is also sharp on $A+cB$, $c\in C$, thus completely settle this ABC sum-product problem. Higher dimensional examples are also discussed.
  In addition to Hausdorff dimension, we also consider Fourier dimension. In particular, now for every $0\leq t\leq s\leq 1$ we have an explicit construction in $\mathbb{R}$ of Hausdorff dimension $s$ and Fourier dimension $t$, together with a measure $\mu$ that captures both dimensions.
  In the end we give new sharpness examples for the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem. In particular, to deal with the non-geometric case we construct measures of "Hausdorff dimension" $a$ and Fourier dimension $b$, even if $a&lt;b$. This clarifies some difference between sets and measures.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Preparing graph states forbidding a vertex-minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement based quantum computing is preformed by adding non-Clifford measurements to a prepared stabilizer states. Entangling gates like CZ are likely to have lower fidelities due to the nature of interacting qubits, so when preparing a stabilizer state, we wish to minimize the number of required entangling states. This naturally introduces the notion of CZ-distance.
  Every stabilizer state is local-Clifford equivalent to a graph state, so we may focus on graph states $\left\vert G \right\rangle$. As a lower bound for general graphs, there exist $n$-vertex graphs $G$ such that the CZ-distance of $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ is $\Omega(n^2 / \log n)$. We obtain significantly improved bounds when $G$ is contained within certain proper classes of graphs. For instance, we prove that if $G$ is a $n$-vertex circle graph with clique number $\omega$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $4n \log \omega + 7n$. We prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph of rank-width at most $k$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $(2^{2^{k+1}} + 1) n$. More generally, this is obtained via a bound of $(k+2)n$ that we prove for graphs of twin-width at most $k$.
  We also study how bounded-rank perturbations and low-rank cuts affect the CZ-distance. As a consequence, we prove that Geelen's Weak Structural Conjecture for vertex-minors implies that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph contained in some fixed proper vertex-minor-closed class of graphs, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $O(n\log n)$. Since graph states of locally equivalent graphs are local Clifford equivalent, proper vertex-minor-closed classes of graphs are natural and very general in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-term relations of the form AB+CD=EF arise in multiple mathematical contexts, including the Ptolemy equation for a cyclic quadrilateral, Casey's theorem on bitangents, Penner's relation for lambda lengths, and Pl\"ucker's identity for the maximal minors of a 2x4-matrix. In this note, we explain how these different occurrences of the 3-term relation can be directly obtained from each other.</description>

      <title>Random graphs, expanding families and the construction of noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniform spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a random graph model $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$, which is a configuration model consisting of interior and boundary vertices. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for graphs in $\mathcal{F}_{\chi,n}$ under various growth regimes of $\chi$ and $n$. When $n = o\left(\chi^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$, we prove that almost every graph in the model is connected and forms an expander family. We also establish upper bounds for the first Steklov eigenvalue, identifying scenarios in which expanders cannot be constructed. Furthermore, we explicitly construct an expanding family in the critical regime $n \asymp g$, and apply it to build a sequence of complete, noncompact hyperbolic surfaces with uniformly positive spectral gaps.</description>
