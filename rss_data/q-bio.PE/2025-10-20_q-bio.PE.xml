      <title>Ambush strategy impacts species predominance and coexistence in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the adaptive Ambush strategy in cyclic models following the rules of the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. In our model, individuals of one species possess cognitive abilities to perceive environmental cues and assess the local density of the species they dominate in the spatial competition for natural resources. Based on this assessment, they either initiate a direct attack or, if the local concentration of target individuals does not justify the risk, reposition strategically to prepare an ambush. To quantify the evolutionary consequences of these behavioural strategies, we perform stochastic simulations, analysing emergent spatial patterns and the dependence of species densities on the threshold used by individuals to decide between immediate attack or anticipation. Our findings reveal that, despite being designed to enhance efficiency, cognitive strategies can reduce the abundance of the species due to the constraints of cyclic dominance. We identify an optimal decision threshold: attacking only when the local density of target individuals exceeds 15% provides the best balance between selection risk and long-term persistence. Furthermore, the Ambush strategy benefits low-mobility organisms, increasing coexistence probabilities by up to 53%. These results deepen the understanding of adaptive decision-making in spatial ecology, linking cognitive complexity to ecosystem resilience and extinction risk.</description>

      <title>Mendelian randomization in a multi-ancestry world: reflections and practical advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Mendelian randomization (MR) papers have been conducted only in people of European ancestry, limiting transportability of results to the global population. Expanding MR to diverse ancestry groups is essential to ensure equitable biomedical insights, yet presents analytical and conceptual challenges. This review examines the practical challenges of MR analyses beyond the European only context, including use of data from multi-ancestry, mismatched ancestry, and admixed populations. We explain how apparent heterogeneity in MR estimates between populations can arise from differences in genetic variant frequencies and correlation patterns, as well as from differences in the distribution of phenotypic variables, complicating the detection of true differences in the causal pathway.
  We summarize published strategies for selecting genetic instruments and performing analyses when working with limited ancestry-specific data, discussing the assumptions needed in each case for incorporating external data from different ancestry populations. We conclude that differences in MR estimates by ancestry group should be interpreted cautiously, with consideration of how the identified differences may arise due to social and cultural factors. Corroborating evidence of a biological mechanism altering the causal pathway is needed to support a conclusion of differing causal pathways between ancestry groups.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic reaction networks with entropic control cost and emergence of mode-switching strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing control cost functions based on the f-divergence, which naturally accounts for population-specific factors. If Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted for the cost function, the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is simplified into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.</description>

      <title>Age-Structured Population Dynamics</title>

Abstract: This chapter reviews some aspects of the theory of age-structured models of populations with finite maximum age. We formulate both the renewal equation for the birth rate and the partial differential equation for the age density, and show their equivalence. Next, we define and discuss central concepts in population dynamics, like the basic reproduction number $R_0$, the Malthusian parameter $r$, and the stable age distribution. We briefly review the sun-star theory that turns the birth term into a bounded additive perturbation, thus allowing to develop stability and bifurcation theory along standard lines. Finally, we review the pseudospectral approximation of the infinite-dimensional age-structured models by means of a finite system of ordinary differential equations, which allows to perform numerical bifurcation analysis with existing software tools. Here, Nicholson's blowfly equation serves as a worked example.</description>

      <title>Size-Structured Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on variable maturation delay or, more precisely, on the mathematical description of a size-structured population consuming an unstructured resource. When the resource concentration is a known function of time, we can describe the growth and survival of individuals quasi-explicitly, i.e., in terms of solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODE). Reproduction is captured by a (non-autonomous) renewal equation, which can be solved by generation expansion. After these preparatory steps, a contraction mapping argument is needed to construct the solution of the coupled consumer-resource system with prescribed initial conditions. As we shall show, this interpretation-guided constructive approach does in fact yield weak solutions of a familiar partial differential equation (PDE). A striking difficulty with the PDE approach is that the solution operators are, in general, not differentiable, precluding a linearized stability analysis of steady states. This is a manifestation of the state-dependent delay difficulty. As a (not entirely satisfactory and rather technical) way out, we present a delay equation description in terms of the history of both the $p$-level birth rate of the consumer population and the resource concentration. We end by using pseudospectral approximation to derive a system of ODE and demonstrating its use in a numerical bifurcation analysis. Importantly, the state-dependent delay difficulty dissolves in this approximation.</description>

      <title>A Human-Vector Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Model for Analyzing and Controlling the Spread of Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.</description>
