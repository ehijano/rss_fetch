      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Weighted Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several resource allocation settings involve agents with unequal entitlements represented by weights. We analyze weighted fair division from an asymptotic perspective: if $m$ items are divided among $n$ agents whose utilities are independently sampled from a probability distribution, when is it likely that a fair allocation exist? We show that if the ratio between the weights is bounded, a weighted envy-free allocation exists with high probability provided that $m = \Omega(n\log n/\log\log n)$, generalizing a prior unweighted result. For weighted proportionality, we establish a sharp threshold of $m = n/(1-\mu)$ for the transition from non-existence to existence, where $\mu\in (0,1)$ denotes the mean of the distribution. In addition, we prove that for two agents, a weighted envy-free (and weighted proportional) allocation is likely to exist if $m = \omega(\sqrt{r})$, where $r$ denotes the ratio between the two weights.</description>

      <title>TheraQuest: A Gamified, LLM-Powered Simulation for Massage Therapy Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massage therapy training emphasizes hands-on techniques and effective therapist--patient communication. However, many educational programs struggle to provide realistic practice scenarios. To address this problem, we propose TheraQuest, a gamified, web-based simulation platform that employs large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse virtual patients with varying symptoms and cultural backgrounds. Through interactive dialogue, anatomical decision-making, and immediate assessment, trainees develop both diagnostic reasoning and empathetic communication skills in a low-risk environment. Unlike exclusively VR-based solutions, TheraQuest remains accessible via standard web browsers, mitigating the cost and discomfort associated with extended headset use. Preliminary testing suggests that integrating LLM-driven virtual patients with real-time skill metrics can enhance trainee engagement and help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical proficiency.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the ``Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, bias and the institution bootstrapping problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Institutions play a critical role in enabling communities to manage common-pool resources and avert tragedies of the commons. However, a fundamental issue arises: Individuals typically perceive participation as advantageous only after an institution is established, creating a paradox: How can institutions form if no one will join before a critical mass exists? We term this conundrum the institution bootstrapping problem and propose that misperception, specifically, agents' erroneous belief that an institution already exists, could resolve this paradox. By integrating well-documented psychological phenomena, including cognitive biases, probability distortion, and perceptual noise, into a game-theoretic framework, we demonstrate how these factors collectively mitigate the bootstrapping problem. Notably, unbiased perceptual noise (e.g., noise arising from agents' heterogeneous physical or social contexts) drastically reduces the critical mass of cooperators required for institutional emergence. This effect intensifies with greater diversity of perceptions. We explain this counter-intuitive result through asymmetric boundary conditions: proportional underestimation of low-probability sanctions produces distinct outcomes compared to equivalent overestimation. Furthermore, the type of perceptual distortion, proportional versus absolute, yields qualitatively different evolutionary pathways. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about rationality in institutional design, highlighting how "noisy" cognition can paradoxically enhance cooperation. Finally, we contextualize these insights within broader discussions of multi-agent system design and collective action. Our analysis underscores the importance of incorporating human-like cognitive constraints, not just idealized rationality, into models of institutional emergence and resilience.</description>

      <title>Beyond Winning Strategies: Admissible and Admissible Winning Strategies for Quantitative Reachability Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical reactive synthesis approaches aim to synthesize a reactive system that always satisfies a given specifications. These approaches often reduce to playing a two-player zero-sum game where the goal is to synthesize a winning strategy. However, in many pragmatic domains, such as robotics, a winning strategy does not always exist, yet it is desirable for the system to make an effort to satisfy its requirements instead of "giving up". To this end, this paper investigates the notion of admissible strategies, which formalize "doing-your-best", in quantitative reachability games. We show that, unlike the qualitative case, quantitative admissible strategies are history-dependent even for finite payoff functions, making synthesis a challenging task. In addition, we prove that admissible strategies always exist but may produce undesirable optimistic behaviors. To mitigate this, we propose admissible winning strategies, which enforce the best possible outcome while being admissible. We show that both strategies always exist but are not memoryless. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of both strategies and propose synthesis algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the strategies on gridworld and robot manipulator domains.</description>

      <title>Oh the Prices You'll See: Designing a Fair Exchange System to Mitigate Personalized Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many online marketplaces personalize prices based on consumer attributes. Since these prices are private, consumers may be unaware that they have spent more on a good than the lowest possible price, and cannot easily take action to pay less. In this paper, we introduce a fairness-centered exchange system that takes advantage of personalized pricing, while still allowing consumers to individually benefit. Our system produces a matching of consumers to promote trading; the lower-paying consumer buys the good for the higher-paying consumer for some fee. We explore various modeling choices and fairness targets to determine which schema will leave consumers best off, while also earning revenue for the system itself. We show that when consumers individually negotiate the transaction price, and our fairness objective is to minimize mean net cost, we are able to achieve the most fair outcomes. Conversely, when transaction prices are centrally set, consumers are often unwilling to transact. When price dispersion (or range) is high, the system can reduce the mean net cost to each individual by $66\%$, or the mean net cost to a group by $69\%$. We find that a high dispersion of original prices is necessary for our system to be viable. Higher dispersion can actually lead to decreased net price paid by consumers, and act as a check against extreme personalization, increasing seller accountability. Our results provide theoretical evidence that such a system could improve fairness for consumers while sustaining itself financially.</description>

      <title>Effective Two-Stage Double Auction for Dynamic Resource Provision over Edge Networks via Discovering The Power of Overbooking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To facilitate responsive and cost-effective computing service delivery over edge networks, this paper investigates a novel two-stage double auction methodology via discovering an interesting idea of resource overbooking to overcome dynamic and uncertain nature of supply of edge servers (sellers) and demand generated from mobile devices (as buyers). The proposed auction integrates multiple essential goals such as maximizing social welfare as well as accelerating the decision-making process from both short-term and long-term views, (e.g., the time for determining winning seller-buyer pairs), by introducing a stagewise strategy: an overbooking-driven pre-double auction (OPDAuction) for determining long-term cooperations between sellers and buyers before practical resource transactions as Stage I, and a real-time backup double auction (RBDAuction) for quickly coping with residual resource demands during actual transactions. In particular, by embedding a proper overbooking rate, OPDAuction helps with facilitating trading contracts between appropriate sellers and buyers as guidance for future transactions, by allowing the booked resources to exceed theoretical supply. Then, since pre-auctions may cause risks, our RBDAuction adjusts to real-time market changes, further enhancing the overall social welfare. More importantly, we offer an interesting view to show that our proposed two-stage auction can support significant design properties such as truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget balance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate good performance in social welfare, time efficiency, and computational scalability, outstripping conventional methods in dynamic edge computing settings.</description>
