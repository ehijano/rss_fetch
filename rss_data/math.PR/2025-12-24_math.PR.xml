      <title>Asymptotics of returns to the coordinate hyperplanes for conditioned simple random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the number of returns to the coordinate hyperplanes for multidimensional nearest-neighbour random walks. While one-dimensional results on returns are classical, much less is known in higher dimensions. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of returns under several natural conditionings: the unconditioned walk, bridges, meanders, and non-negative bridges (or excursions). Our main results characterize the limiting distributions under appropriate rescaling. The resulting one-dimensional marginals may be half-normal, Rayleigh, geometric, negative binomial, or certain mixtures thereof. In most situations, the coordinates are asymptotically independent; however, there are notable exceptions for the meander case, depending on the drift. The proofs rely on conditioning on the numbers of horizontal and vertical steps, which restores a form of independence and reduces the problem to one-dimensional estimates via binomial convolution and Bernstein-type approximations.</description>

      <title>On the convoy of the ASEP speed process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the size of the convoy in the speed process in the multi-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). Through a coupling argument, we obtain an exact formula for the expected convoy size by relating it to a combinatorial structure. We prove that the asymptotic expected convoy size is universal for all fixed jump rates $q \in [0,1)$. In the special case $q=0$, we upgrade this to full convergence in distribution. We further establish a critical scaling $q = 1 - \gamma/\sqrt{n}$ that yields a nontrivial limiting regime. Our analysis builds on Martin's construction of the convoy and makes use of an orthogonal-polynomial representation of random-walk transition probabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the multidimensional Skorokhod problem for c\`adl\`ag processes, where the reflection is subject to a minimality condition depending on the law of the solution. We then apply these results to establish existence and uniqueness for multidimensional McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with mean reflection. Finally, we address the existence of optimal relaxed controls for such equations.</description>

      <title>A semicircle law for the normalized Laplacian of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized Laplacian $\mathcal L$ of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $G(n,p)$. To account for the presence of isolated vertices in the sparse regime, we define $\mathcal L$ using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the degree matrix. Under this convention, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of a suitably normalized $\mathcal L$ converges weakly in probability to the semicircle law whenever $np\to\infty$, thereby providing a rigorous justification of a prediction made in (Akara-pipattana and Evnin, 2023). Moreover, if $np&gt;\log n+\omega(1)$, so that $G(n,p)$ has no isolated vertices with high probability, the same conclusion holds for the standard definition of $\mathcal L$. We further strengthen this result to almost sure convergence when $np=\Omega(\log n)$. Finally, we extend our approach to the Chung-Lu random graph model, where we establish a semicircle law for $\mathcal L$ itself, improving upon (Chung, Lu, and Vu 2003), which obtained the semicircle law only for a proxy matrix.</description>

      <title>Up-down chains and scaling limits: application to permuton- and graphon-valued diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An up-down chain is a Markov chain in which each transition is a two-step process that moves up to a larger object and then back down to an object of the original size. The first goal of this paper is to present a general framework for analyzing these chains and computing their scaling limits. This approach unifies much of the existing literature while extending it in several directions. These include explicit conditions for constructing integrable up-down chains and convergence results for families of intertwined processes. The latter contribute to the method of intertwiners of Borodin and Olshanski.
  The second goal is to highlight a notable application of this framework to the settings of permutations and graphs. Here, we identify some integrable up-down chains and construct their scaling limits, a family of permuton- and graphon-valued Feller diffusions. Both the up-down chains and the limiting diffusions exhibit ergodicity, diagonalizable semigroups, and explicit expressions for the maximal separation distance to stationarity. For the diffusions, the stationary measures are the recursive separable permutons and recursive cographons recently introduced by the authors, and the separation distances turn out to be related to the Dedekind eta function.</description>

      <title>From the planar Ising model to quasiconformal mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the scaling limit of full-plane Kadanoff-Ceva fermions on generic, non-degenerate $s$-embeddings. In this broad setting, the scaling limits are described in terms of solutions to conjugate Beltrami equations with prescribed singularities. For the underlying Ising model, this leads to the scaling limit of the energy-energy correlations and reveals a connection between the scaling limits of (near-)critical planar Ising models and quasiconformal mappings. For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another.
  These results confirm the predictions of Chelkak and highlight that the scaling limits of generic (near-)critical Ising models naturally live on a substantially richer conformal structure than the classical Euclidean one.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the number of domino tilings of L-shaped Aztec domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain precise asymptotics for the weighted number of domino tilings of an L-shaped subset of the Aztec diamond, obtained by removing an approximate rectangle in a corner of the Aztec diamond. By tuning the size of the removed corner, we observe different types of asymptotics. For a small removed corner, the number of tilings is close to that of the full Aztec diamond. Enlarging the removed corner to a critical size, a phase transition described in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution occurs. Further increasing the size of the removed region, we observe a sharp decrease of the number of tilings, until it is finally approximated by the number of tilings of two smaller disjoint Aztec diamonds. We obtain uniform asymptotics for the number of domino tilings which fully describe these transitions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limits of collisions and fluxes in the exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the usual hydrodynamic description of the symmetric exclusion process by keeping track of collision events corresponding to jumps into already occupied sites, thereby quantifying the dissipated part of the microscopic activity that is otherwise discarded by the empirical density in the macroscopic limit. In addition to the empirical density and net current, we study unidirectional fluxes and collision counts under flexible joint scalings of the lattice spacing and particle number. These collision and flux observables have regime dependent hydrodynamic limits, with deterministic unidirectional behaviour and a stochastic space time white noise limit for the net collision count. Our results provide a quantitative decomposition of exclusion dynamics into transport and collision effects and clarify how microscopic blocking manifests at the macroscopic and fluctuation levels.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approximation of a Keller--Segel PDE by a branching moderately interacting particle system and suppression of blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keller--Segel PDE is a model for chemotaxis known to exhibit possible finite-time blow-up. Following a seminal work by Tello and Winkler, a logistic damping term is added in this PDE and local well-posedness of mild solutions is proven. When the space dimension is $2$ or when the damping is strong enough, the solution is global in time. In the second part of this work, a microscopic description of this model is introduced in terms of a system of stochastic moderately interacting particles. This system features two main characteristics: the interaction between particles happens through a singular (Coulomb-type) kernel which is attractive; and the particles are subject to demographic events, birth and death due to local competition with other particles. The latter induces a branching structure of the particle system. Then the main result of this work is the convergence of the empirical measure of the particle system towards the Keller--Segel PDE with logistic damping, with a rate of order $N^{-\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}$.</description>

      <title>Uniform spanning trees and random matrix statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a uniform spanning tree in a $\delta$-square grid approximation of a planar domain $\Omega$. For given integer $n\ge 2$, we condition the tree on the following $n$-arm event: we pick $n$ branches, emanating from $n$ points microscopically close to a given interior point, and condition them to connect to the boundary $\partial \Omega$ without intersecting. What can be said about the geometry of these branches?
  We derive an exact formula for the characteristic function of the total winding of the branches. A surprising consequence of this formula is that in the scaling limit, the behaviour of this function depends on the total number of branches $n$ only through its parity.
  We also describe the scaling limit of the branches. If $\Omega $ is the unit disc, then they hit the boundary (i.e., the unit circle) at random positions which coincide exactly with the eigenvalues of a random matrix of size $n$ drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE, also called C$\beta$E with $\beta =1$). Furthermore, the branches converge to Loewner evolution driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motion with parameter $\beta = 4$ (i.e., $n$-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with $\kappa=2$). We thus verify a prediction made by Cardy in this setting.
  Along the way, we develop a flow-line (imaginary geometry) coupling of $n$-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with the Gaussian free field, which may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that the variance of the corresponding field near the singularity also does not depend on the number $n\ge 2$ of curves. In contrast, the variance of the the winding of the curves behaves as $\kappa/n^2$, which agrees with the predictions from the physics literature made by Wieland and Wilson numerically, and by Duplantier and Binder using Coulomb gas methods -- but disagrees with a result of Kenyon.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation of stabilizing Poisson pair functionals with column-type dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two specific types of $d$-dimensional Poisson functionals: a double-sum type and a sum-log-sum type, both over pairs of Poisson points. On these functionals, we impose column-type dependence, i.e., local behavior in the first $k$ directions and allow non-local, yet stabilizing behavior in the remaining $d-k$ directions.
  The main contribution of the paper is to establish sufficient conditions for Normal approximation for sequences of such functionals over growing regions. Specifically, for any fixed region, we provide an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between each functional and the standard Normal distribution.
  We then apply these results to several examples. Inspired by problems in computer science, we prove a Normal approximation for the rectilinear crossing number, arising from projections of certain random graphs onto a 2-dimensional plane. From the field of topological data analysis, we examine two types of barcode summaries, the inversion count and the tree realization number, and establish Normal approximations for both summaries under suitable models of the topological lifetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Airy wanderer line ensembles are infinite-parameter generalizations of the classical Airy line ensemble that arise naturally as scaling limits of inhomogeneous (spiked) models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. In this paper, we establish several structural properties of these ensembles. Our results show their laws depend continuously on the parameters, which encode the asymptotic slopes of the ensemble's curves near positive and negative infinity. We further prove that these ensembles admit multiple monotone couplings with respect to their parameters. Finally, we show that the Airy wanderer line ensembles are extreme points in the space of all Brownian Gibbsian line ensembles on the real line.</description>

      <title>Composable, unconditional security without a Quantum secret key: public broadcast channels and their conceptualizations, adaptive bit transmission rates, fidelity pruning under wiretaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine public broadcast, forward conceptual, and backward conceptual, Quantum channels in the context of communication protocols that are independent of secret keys. Given research directions of interest previously identified in arXiv: 1804.01797, besides converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate obtained by the author in recent work (arXiv: 2507.03035), additional possibilities remain, including: (1) determining whether aspects of QKD dependent protocols can be incorporated into steps of QKD independent protocols; (2) whether there would be any amplification to the Quantum-classical performance gap that Alice and Bob can exploit towards prospective Quantum advantage; (3) formulating the conditions under which secrecy and authentication can be simultaneously achieved. To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds.</description>

      <title>Towards a Statistical Validation of the Critical Wave Groups Method for Free-Running Vessels in Beam Seas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the statistics of extreme events using deterministic wave group methods has largely been simplified to vessels at zero or constant speed and heading. In contrast, free-running vessels move with six degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF), leading to more complex and varied extreme response events. This paper details the extension of the Critical Wave Groups (CWG) method to free-running vessels and demonstrates that the method produces probability calculations comparable to those from a limited Monte Carlo dataset for a vessel in beam seas. This research is a critical first step in the formal validation of this free-running implementation of the CWG method.</description>

      <title>Stability of mathematical quasicrystals under statistical convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19854</link>

Abstract: In this work, we prove that if a uniformly separated sequence in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is uniformly quasicrystalline and converges rapidly enough to a discrete set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ having the same separation radius as the sequence, then $X$ is also a quasicrystal. The convergence is addressed for a distance that quantifies the statistical closeness between two uniformly discrete point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, motivated by the robustness of quasicrystals under random perturbations, we establish the continuity, for this distance, of the Fourier Transform of quasicrystals. This continuity result, in turn, allows us to rigorously demonstrate that established robustness properties of quasicrystals against random errors remain stable under the statistical convergence considered.</description>

      <title>Critical Hermitian matrix model with external source and Boussinesq hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random Hermitian matrix model of dimension $2n$, with external source, defined by the probability density function \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{Z_{2n}} \lvert \det(M) \rvert^{\alpha} e^{-2n\mathrm{Tr} (V(M) - AM)}, \quad V(x) = \frac{x^4}{4} - t\frac{x^2}{2}, \end{equation*} where the external source $A$ has two eigenvalues $\pm a$ of equal multiplicity. We investigate the limiting local statistics of the eigenvalues of $M$ around $0$ in certain critical regimes as $n \to \infty$. When the parameters $t$ and $a$ lie on a critical curve along which the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes as $|x|^{1/3}$, the double scaling limit of the correlation kernel is constructed from functions associated with the Boussinesq equation. This new limiting kernel reduces to the classical Pearcey kernel when $\alpha = 0$. Furthermore, in the multi-critical case where the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes as $|x|^{5/3}$, the limiting kernel is built from the second member of the Boussinesq hierarchy. We derive the results by transforming the random matrix model into biorthogonal ensembles that are analogous to the Muttalib-Borodin ensemble, and then analyzing its asymptotic behavior via a vector Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of optimal control problems governed by nonlinear stochastic equations of monotone type under certain coercivity and linear growth conditions. We give first order necessary conditions of optimality. A stochastic Pontryagin principle can be recovered in the case that the diffusion doesn't depend on the control. We give several applications, most notably for stochastic porous media equations in the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>Boundary Toda Conformal Field Theory from the path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toda Conformal Field Theories (CFTs hereafter) are generalizations of Liouville CFT where the underlying field is no longer scalar but takes values in a finite-dimensional vector space induced by a complex simple Lie algebra. The goal of this document is to provide a probabilistic construction of such models on all compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces with or without boundary. To do so, we rely on a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian Free Fields and Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos.
  In the presence of a boundary, one major difference with Liouville CFT is the existence of non-trivial outer automorphisms of the underlying Lie algebra. The main novelty of our construction is to associate to such an outer automorphism a type of boundary conditions for the field of the theory, leading to the definition of two different classes of models, with either Neumann or Cardy boundary conditions. This in turn has implications on the algebra of symmetry of the models, which are given by $W$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Approach to Hyperuniformity in the One-Dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</description>

Abstract: For Poisson particle processes in hyperbolic space we introduce and study concepts analogous to the intersection density and the mean visible volume, which were originally considered in the analysis of Boolean models in Euclidean space. In particular, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the finiteness of the mean visible volume of a Boolean model in terms of the intensity and the mean surface area of the typical grain.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for small data in a 3D temperature-velocity model with Dirichlet boundary noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a three-dimensional Boussinesq-type temperature-velocity system on a bounded smooth domain $\mathcal D\subset\mathbb R^3$, where the velocity $u^\varepsilon$ solves the Navier-Stokes equations and the temperature $\theta^\varepsilon$ is driven by Dirichlet boundary noise of intensity $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$. The boundary forcing produces a stochastic convolution $Z^\varepsilon$ which is, in general, only continuous in time with values in $H^{-\frac12-\delta_\theta}(\mathcal D)$. To handle this roughness together with initial data $\theta_0\in W^{s,6/5}(\mathcal D)$, we work in the ambient space $H^{-\frac12-\delta_u}(\mathcal D)$ with $\delta_u\ge \max\{\delta_\theta,\frac12-s\}$.
  Given a finite time $T&gt;0$, for any $p&gt;4$ and sufficiently small initial data, we prove existence and uniqueness of a mild solution $(u^\varepsilon,\theta^\varepsilon)$ up to a stopping time $\tau^\varepsilon\le T$ such that $$ u^\varepsilon \in W^{1,p}(0,\tau^\varepsilon;H^{-\frac12-\delta_u}(\mathcal D)) \cap L^p (0,\tau^\varepsilon;H^{\frac32-\delta_u}(\mathcal D)), \quad \theta^\varepsilon \in C(0,\tau^\varepsilon;H^{-\frac12-\delta_u}(\mathcal D)). $$ Moreover, we obtain a high-probability global existence estimate of the form $\mathbb P(\tau^\varepsilon=T)\geq 1- C\varepsilon $, with $C= C( \delta_\theta, T)&gt;0.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study biased variable-speed random walks in dynamical random conductances. Assuming that the conductances are upper-bounded, we prove that the walk has strictly positive speed for every bias $\lambda&gt;0$. We then give an explicit asymptotic formula for the speed for $\lambda \to + \infty$, and prove two monotonicity properties for the speed. Finally, we provide an example showing that, even for conductances that are bounded and bounded away from zero, the speed can be asymptotically decreasing in the bias.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the martingale characterizations of non-homogeneous counting processes and their fractional generalizations. We show that the weighted sum of non-homogeneous Poisson processes (NPPs) is the non-homogeneous generalized counting process (NGCP). Both the compensated and exponential forms of martingale characterization for NGCP are obtained, and are shown to be equivalent. Moreover, we provide martingale characterizations for various time-changed variants of the NGCP and their Skellam versions using stable and/or inverse stable subordinators.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Aspects of the Log-Laplace Transform and a Non-Euclidean Proximal Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient sampling algorithms catering to non-Euclidean geometries has been a challenging endeavor, as discretization techniques which succeed in the Euclidean setting do not readily carry over to more general settings. We develop a non-Euclidean analog of the recent proximal sampler of [LST21], which naturally induces regularization by an object known as the log-Laplace transform (LLT) of a density. We prove new mathematical properties (with an algorithmic flavor) of the LLT, such as strong convexity-smoothness duality and an isoperimetric inequality, which are used to prove a mixing time on our proximal sampler matching [LST21] under a warm start. As our main application, we show our warm-started sampler improves the value oracle complexity of differentially private convex optimization in $\ell_p$ and Schatten-$p$ norms for $p \in [1, 2]$ to match the Euclidean setting [GLL22], while retaining state-of-the-art excess risk bounds [GLLST23]. We find our investigation of the LLT to be a promising proof-of-concept of its utility as a tool for designing samplers, and outline directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Iterated sampling importance resampling with adaptive number of proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iterated sampling importance resampling (i-SIR) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm which is based on $N$ independent proposals. As $N$ grows, its samples become nearly independent, but with an increased computational cost. We discuss a method which finds an approximately optimal number of proposals $N$ in terms of the asymptotic efficiency. The optimal $N$ depends on both the mixing properties of the i-SIR chain and the (parallel) computing costs. Our method for finding an appropriate $N$ is based on an approximate asymptotic variance of the i-SIR, which has similar properties as the i-SIR asymptotic variance, and a generalised i-SIR transition having fractional `number of proposals.' These lead to an adaptive i-SIR algorithm, which tunes the number of proposals automatically during sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that our approximate efficiency and the adaptive i-SIR algorithm have promising empirical behaviour. We also present new theoretical results regarding the i-SIR, such as the convexity of asymptotic variance in the number of proposals, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Misinformation Propagation in Complex Networks: Topology-Dependent Distortion and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation is pervasive in natural, biological, social, and engineered systems, yet its quantitative characterization remains challenging. We develop a general mathematical framework for quantifying information distortion in distributed systems by modeling how local transmission errors accumulate along network geodesics and reshape each agent's perceived global state. Through a drift-fluctuation decomposition of pathwise binomial noise, we derive closed-form expressions for node-level perception distributions and show that directional bias induces only a uniform shift in the mean, preserving the fluctuation structure. Applying the framework to canonical graph ensembles, we uncover strong topological signatures of misinformation: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs exhibit a double-peaked distortion profile driven by connectivity transitions and geodesic-length fluctuations, scale-free networks suppress misinformation through hub-mediated integration, and optimally rewired small-world networks achieve comparable suppression by balancing clustering with short paths. A direct comparison across regular lattices, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, and Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks reveals a connectivity-dependent crossover. In the extremely sparse regime, scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks behave similarly. At intermediate sparsity, Watts-Strogatz small-world networks exhibit the lowest misinformation. In contrast, Barab\'as-Albert scale-free networks maintain low misinformation in sparse and dense regimes, while regular lattices produce the highest distortion across connectivities. We additionally show how sparsity constraints, structural organization, and connection costs delineate regimes of minimal misinformation.</description>
