      <title>Robust Utility Optimization via a GAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust utility optimization enables an investor to deal with market uncertainty in a structured way, with the goal of maximizing the worst-case outcome. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to (approximately) solve robust utility optimization problems in general and realistic settings. In particular, we model both the investor and the market by neural networks (NN) and train them in a mini-max zero-sum game. This approach is applicable for any continuous utility function and in realistic market settings with trading costs, where only observable information of the market can be used. A large empirical study shows the versatile usability of our method. Whenever an optimal reference strategy is available, our method performs on par with it and in the (many) settings without known optimal strategy, our method outperforms all other reference strategies. Moreover, we can conclude from our study that the trained path-dependent strategies do not outperform Markovian ones. Lastly, we uncover that our generative approach for learning optimal, (non-) robust investments under trading costs generates universally applicable alternatives to well known asymptotic strategies of idealized settings.</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDEs for large portfolios with general mean-reverting volatility processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.05898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a structural stochastic volatility model for the loss from a large portfolio of credit risky assets. Both the asset value and the volatility processes are correlated through systemic Brownian motions, with default determined by the asset value reaching a lower boundary. We prove that if our volatility models are picked from a class of mean-reverting diffusions, the system converges as the portfolio becomes large and, when the vol-of-vol function satisfies certain regularity and boundedness conditions, the limit of the empirical measure process has a density given in terms of a solution to a stochastic initial-boundary value problem on a half-space. The problem is defined in a special weighted Sobolev space. Regularity results are established for solutions to this problem, and then we show that there exists a unique solution. In contrast to the CIR volatility setting covered by the existing literature, our results hold even when the systemic Brownian motions are taken to be correlated.</description>

      <title>Can a GPT4-Powered AI Agent Be a Good Enough Performance Attribution Analyst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performance attribution analysis, defined as the process of explaining the drivers of the excess performance of an investment portfolio against a benchmark, stands as a significant feature of portfolio management and plays a crucial role in the investment decision-making process, particularly within the fund management industry. Rooted in a solid financial and mathematical framework, the importance and methodologies of this analytical technique are extensively documented across numerous academic research papers and books. The integration of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents marks a groundbreaking development in this field. These agents are designed to automate and enhance the performance attribution analysis by accurately calculating and analyzing portfolio performances against benchmarks. In this study, we introduce the application of an AI Agent for a variety of essential performance attribution tasks, including the analysis of performance drivers and utilizing LLMs as calculation engine for multi-level attribution analysis and question-answering (QA) tasks. Leveraging advanced prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Plan and Solve (PS), and employing a standard agent framework from LangChain, the research achieves promising results: it achieves accuracy rates exceeding 93% in analyzing performance drivers, attains 100% in multi-level attribution calculations, and surpasses 84% accuracy in QA exercises that simulate official examination standards. These findings affirm the impactful role of AI agents, prompt engineering and evaluation in advancing portfolio management processes, highlighting a significant development in the practical application and evaluation of Generative AI technologies within the domain.</description>
