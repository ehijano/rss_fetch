      <title>Optimizing PyTorch Inference with LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems. Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.</description>

      <title>A segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm for agricultural multi-robot task allocation with energy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot systems have emerged as a key technology for addressing the efficiency and cost challenges in labor-intensive industries. In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity. This research provides a novel theoretical perspective and an effective solution for the multi-robot task allocation problem under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Code Verification with Compound Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs generate buggy code: 29.6% of SWE-bench "solved" patches fail, 62% of BaxBench solutions have vulnerabilities, and existing tools only catch 65% of bugs with 35% false positives. We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution. We tested 15 different agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with gains of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4. The best two-agent combination reaches 79.3% accuracy. Testing on 300 real patches from Claude Sonnet 4.5 runs in under 200ms per sample, making this practical for production use.</description>

      <title>Multi-UAV Swarm Obstacle Avoidance Based on Potential Field Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi UAV scenarios,the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method often leads to redundant flight paths and frequent abrupt heading changes due to unreasonable obstacle avoidance path planning,and is highly prone to inter UAV collisions during the obstacle avoidance process.To address these issues,this study proposes a novel hybrid algorithm that combines the improved Multi-Robot Formation Obstacle Avoidance (MRF IAPF) algorithm with an enhanced APF optimized for single UAV path planning.Its core ideas are as follows:first,integrating three types of interaction forces from MRF IAPF obstacle repulsion force,inter UAV interaction force,and target attraction force;second,incorporating a refined single UAV path optimization mechanism,including collision risk assessment and an auxiliary sub goal strategy.When a UAV faces a high collision threat,temporary waypoints are generated to guide obstacle avoidance,ensuring eventual precise arrival at the actual target.Simulation results demonstrate that compared with traditional APF based formation algorithms,the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvements in path length optimization and heading stability,can effectively avoid obstacles and quickly restore the formation configuration,thus verifying its applicability and effectiveness in static environments with unknown obstacles.</description>

      <title>Agentifying Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Latency on a Progressive Second-Price Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The progressive second-price auction of Lazar and Semret is a decentralized mechanism for the allocation and real-time pricing of a divisible resource. Our focus is on how delays in the receipt of bid messages, asynchronous analysis by buyers of the market and randomness in the initial bids affect the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria obtained by the method of truthful $\varepsilon$-best reply. We introduce an algorithm for finding minimal-revenue equilibrium states and then show that setting a reserve price just below clearing stabilizes seller revenue while maintaining efficiency. Utility is of primary interest given the assumption of elastic demand. Although some buyers experienced unpredictability in the value and cost of their individual allocations, their respective utilities were predictable.</description>

      <title>MDG: Masked Denoising Generation for Multi-Agent Behavior Modeling in Traffic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling realistic and interactive multi-agent behavior is critical to autonomous driving and traffic simulation. However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.</description>

      <title>Area-Optimal Control Strategies for Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel strategy for a multi-agent pursuit-evasion game involving multiple faster pursuers with heterogenous speeds and a single slower evader. We define a geometric region, the evader's safe-reachable set, as the intersection of Apollonius circles derived from each pursuer-evader pair. The capture strategy is formulated as a zero-sum game where the pursuers cooperatively minimize the area of this set, while the evader seeks to maximize it, effectively playing a game of spatial containment. By deriving the analytical gradients of the safe-reachable set's area with respect to agent positions, we obtain closed-form, instantaneous optimal control laws for the heading of each agent. These strategies are computationally efficient, allowing for real-time implementation. Simulations demonstrate that the gradient-based controls effectively steer the pursuers to systematically shrink the evader's safe region, leading to guaranteed capture. This area-minimization approach provides a clear geometric objective for cooperative capture.</description>

      <title>LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Design of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agent Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era where vast amounts of data are collected and processed from diverse sources, there is a growing demand for sophisticated AI systems capable of intelligently fusing and analyzing this information. To address these challenges, researchers have turned towards integrating tools into LLM-powered agents to enhance the overall information fusion process. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture, resulting in a lack of modularity and terminological inconsistencies among researchers. To address these issues, we propose a novel LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework (LLM-Agent-UMF) that establishes a clear foundation for agent development from both functional and software architectural perspectives, developed and evaluated using the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF). Our framework clearly distinguishes between the different components of an LLM-based agent, setting LLMs and tools apart from a new element, the core-agent, which plays the role of central coordinator. This pivotal entity comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security -- the latter often neglected in previous works. By classifying core-agents into passive and active types based on their authoritative natures, we propose various multi-core agent architectures that combine unique characteristics of distinctive agents to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. We evaluate our framework by applying it to thirteen state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assess five architecture variants of our framework by designing new agent architectures that combine characteristics of state-of-the-art agents to address specific goals. ...</description>

      <title>Steering Noncooperative Games Through Conjecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dynamic noncooperative games, each player makes conjectures about other players' reactions before choosing a strategy. However, resulting equilibria may be multiple and do not always lead to desirable outcomes. These issues are typically addressed separately, for example, through opponent modelling and incentive design. Drawing inspiration from conjectural variations games, we propose an incentive design framework in which a coordinator first computes an equilibrium by optimizing a predefined objective function, then communicates this equilibrium as a target for the players to reach. In a centralized setting, the coordinator also optimizes the conjectures to steer the players towards the target. In decentralized settings, players independently compute conjectures and update their strategies based on individual targets. We provide a guarantee of equilibrium existence in both cases. This framework uses conjectures not only to guide the system towards desirable outcomes but also to decouple the game into independent optimization problems, enabling efficient computation and parallelization in large-scale settings. We illustrate our theoretical results on classical representative noncooperative games, demonstrating its application potential.</description>
