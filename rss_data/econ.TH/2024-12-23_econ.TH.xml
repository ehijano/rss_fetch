      <title>Prudence and higher-order risk attitudes in the rank-dependent utility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a full characterization of consistency with respect to higher-order stochastic dominance within the rank-dependent utility model. Different from the results in the literature, we do not assume any conditions on the utility functions and the probability weighting function, such as differentiability or continuity. It turns out that the level of generality that we offer leads to models that do not have a continuous probability weighting function and yet they satisfy prudence. In particular, the corresponding probability weighting function can only have a jump at 1, and must be linear on [0,1).</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Mechanism Design: Jointly Eliciting Preferences and Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mechanism design when agents hold private information about both their preferences and a common payoff-relevant state. We show that standard message-driven mechanisms cannot implement socially efficient allocations when agents have multidimensional types, even under favorable conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose data-driven mechanisms that leverage additional post-allocation information, modeled as an estimator of the payoff-relevant state. Our data-driven mechanisms extend the classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves class. We show that they achieve exact implementation in posterior equilibrium when the state is either fully revealed or the utility is linear in an unbiased estimator. We also show that they achieve approximate implementation with a consistent estimator, converging to exact implementation as the estimator converges, and present bounds on the convergence rate. We demonstrate applications to digital advertising auctions and large language model (LLM)-based mechanisms, where user engagement naturally reveals relevant information.</description>

      <title>On the Fairness of Additive Welfarist Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allocating indivisible goods is a ubiquitous task in fair division. We study additive welfarist rules, an important class of rules which choose an allocation that maximizes the sum of some function of the agents' utilities. Prior work has shown that the maximum Nash welfare (MNW) rule is the unique additive welfarist rule that guarantees envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). We strengthen this result by showing that MNW remains the only additive welfarist rule that ensures EF1 for identical-good instances, two-value instances, as well as normalized instances with three or more agents. On the other hand, if the agents' utilities are integers, we demonstrate that several other rules offer the EF1 guarantee, and provide characterizations of these rules for various classes of instances.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework of mass transport between vector-valued measures, which will be called simultaneous optimal transport (SOT). The new framework is motivated by the need to transport resources of different types simultaneously, i.e., in single trips, from specified origins to destinations; similarly, in economic matching, one needs to couple two groups, e.g., buyers and sellers, by equating supplies and demands of different goods at the same time. The mathematical structure of simultaneous transport is very different from the classic setting of optimal transport, leading to many new challenges. The Monge and Kantorovich formulations are contrasted and connected. Existence conditions and duality formulas are established. More interestingly, by connecting SOT to a natural relaxation of martingale optimal transport (MOT), we introduce the MOT-SOT parity, which allows for explicit solutions of SOT in many interesting cases.</description>

      <title>On Monotone Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study monotone persuasion in the linear case, where posterior distributions over states are summarized by their mean. We solve the two leading cases where optimal unrestricted signals can be nonmonotone. First, if the objective is s-shaped and the state is discrete, then optimal monotone signals are upper censorship, whereas optimal unrestricted signals may require randomization. Second, if the objective is m-shaped and the state is continuous, then optimal monotone signals are interval disclosure, whereas optimal unrestricted signals may require nonmonotone pooling. We illustrate our results with an application to media censorship.</description>
