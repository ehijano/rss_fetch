      <title>Scientific judgment drifts over time in AI ideation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery begins with ideas, yet evaluating early-stage research concepts is a subtle and subjective human judgment. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating scientific hypotheses, most systems assume that scientists' evaluations form a fixed gold standard, and that scientists' judgments do not change. Here we challenge this assumption. In a two-wave study with 7,182 ratings from 57 active researchers across six scientific departments, each participant repeatedly evaluated a constant "control" research idea alongside AI-generated ideas. We show that scientists' ratings of the very same idea systematically drift over time: overall quality scores increased by 0.61 points on a 0-10 scale (P = 0.005), and test-retest reliability was only moderate across core dimensions of scientific value, revealing systematic temporal drift in perceived idea quality. Yet the internal structure of judgment remained stable, such as the relative importance placed on originality, feasibility, clarity. We then aligned an LLM-based ideation system to first-wave human ratings and used it to select new ideas. Although alignment improved agreement with Wave-1 evaluations, its apparent gains disappeared once drift in human standards was accounted for. Thus, tuning to a fixed human snapshot produced improvements that were transient rather than persistent. These findings reveal that human evaluation of scientific ideas is not static but a dynamic process with stable priorities and requires shifting calibration. Treating one-time human ratings as immutable ground truth risks overstating progress in AI-assisted ideation and obscuring the challenge of co-evolving with changing expert standards. Drift-aware evaluation protocols and longitudinal benchmarks may therefore be essential for building AI systems that reliably augment, rather than overfit to, human scientific judgment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Public Speaking Skills in Engineering Students Through AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research-to-practice full paper was inspired by the persistent challenge in effective communication among engineering students. Public speaking is a necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication.</description>

      <title>Do intelligent tutoring systems benefit K-12 students? A meta-analysis and evaluation of heterogeneity of treatment effects in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To expand the use of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) in K-12 schools, it is essential to understand the conditions under which their use is most beneficial. This meta-analysis evaluated the heterogeneity of ITS effects across studies focusing on elementary, middle, and high schools in the U.S. It included 18 studies with 77 effect sizes across 11 ITS. Overall, there was a significant positive effect size of ITS on U.S. K-12 students' learning outcomes (g=0.271, SE=0.011, p=0.001). Furthermore, effect sizes were similar across elementary and middle schools, and for low-achieving students, but were lower in studies including rural schools. A MetaForest analysis showed that providing worked-out examples, intervention duration, intervention condition, type of learning outcome, and immediate measurement were the most important moderators of treatment effects.</description>

      <title>8bit-GPT: Exploring Human-AI Interaction on Obsolete Macintosh Operating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of assistive chatbots offering efficient, personalized communication has driven widespread over-reliance on them for decision-making, information-seeking and everyday tasks. This dependence was found to have adverse consequences on information retention as well as lead to superficial emotional attachment. As such, this work introduces 8bit-GPT; a language model simulated on a legacy Macintosh Operating System, to evoke reflection on the nature of Human-AI interaction and the consequences of anthropomorphic rhetoric. Drawing on reflective design principles such as slow-technology and counterfunctionality, this work aims to foreground the presence of chatbots as a tool by defamiliarizing the interface and prioritizing inefficient interaction, creating a friction between the familiar and not.</description>

      <title>VEIL: Reading Control Flow Graphs Like Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control flow graphs (CFGs) are essential tools for understanding program behavior, yet the size of real-world CFGs makes them difficult to interpret. With thousands of nodes and edges, sophisticated graph drawing algorithms are required to present them on screens in ways that make them readable and understandable. However, being designed for general graphs, these algorithms frequently break the natural flow of execution, placing later instructions before earlier ones and obscuring critical program structures. In this paper, we introduce a set of criteria specifically tailored for CFG visualization, focusing on preserving execution order and making complex structures easier to follow. Building on these criteria, we present VEIL, a new layout algorithm that uses dominator analysis to produce clearer, more intuitive CFG layouts. Through a study of CFGs from real-world applications, we show how our method improves readability and provides improved layout performance compared to state of the art graph drawing techniques.</description>

      <title>FM4Com: Foundation Model for Scene-Adaptive Communication Strategy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks heralds an intelligent communication ecosystem driven by AI-native air interfaces. However, current physical-layer designs-typically following modular and isolated optimization paradigms-fail to achieve global end-to-end optimality due to neglected inter-module dependencies. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to communication tasks such as beam prediction and resource allocation, existing studies remain limited to single-task or single-modality scenarios and lack the ability to jointly reason over communication states and user intents for personalized strategy adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multimodal communication decision-making model based on reinforcement learning. The proposed model semantically aligns channel state information (CSI) and textual user instructions, enabling comprehensive understanding of both physical-layer conditions and communication intents. It then generates physically realizable, user-customized link construction strategies that dynamically adapt to changing environments and preference tendencies. A two-stage reinforcement learning framework is employed: the first stage expands the experience pool via heuristic exploration and behavior cloning to obtain a near-optimal initialization, while the second stage fine-tunes the model through multi-objective reinforcement learning considering bit error rate, throughput, and complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms conventional planning-based algorithms under challenging channel conditions, achieving robust, efficient, and personalized 6G link construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ACCADIL is a project that led to the development of software tools for the identification of coin die links from coin photographs. It provides a computational algorithm based on computer vision and classification techniques, along with an online interface for the interactive verification of results. This guide briefly describes the algorithmic principles, the preparation of data prior to analysis, and the features offered by the interface: dataset addition, visualization modes (overlay, side-by-side, magnifier, transparency), result export, and distance visualization. ACCADIL thus provides numismatists with a comprehensive tool for the analysis of die links within a coin collection.</description>

      <title>psiUnity: A Platform for Multimodal Data-Driven XR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) research increasingly relies on the ability to stream and synchronize multimodal data between headsets and immersive applications for data-driven interaction and experimentation. However, developers face a critical gap: the Platform for Situated Intelligence (psi), which excels at deterministic temporal alignment and multimodal data management, has been largely inaccessible to the dominant Unity/MRTK ecosystem used for HoloLens development. We introduce psiUnity, an open-source C# integration that bridges psi's .NET libraries with Unity 2022.3 and MRTK3 for HoloLens 2. psiUnity enables bidirectional, real-time streaming of head pose, hand tracking, gaze, IMU, audio, and depth sensor data (AHAT and long-throw) with microsecond-level temporal precision, allowing Unity applications to both consume and produce synchronized multimodal data streams. By embedding psi's native serialization, logging, and temporal coordination directly within Unity's architecture, psiUnity extends psi beyond its previous StereoKit limitations and empowers the HRI, HCI, and embodied-AI communities to develop reproducible, data-driven XR interactions and experiments within the familiar Unity environment. The integration is available at https://github.com/sailgt/psiUnity.</description>

      <title>Semantic Interactivity: leveraging NLP to enable a shared interaction approach for joint activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collocated collaboration, where individuals work together in the same physical space and time, remains a cornerstone of effective teamwork. However, most collaborative systems are designed to support individual tasks rather than joint activities; they enable interactions for users to complete tasks rather than interactivity to engage in shared experiences. In this work, we introduce an NLP-driven mechanism that enables semantic interactivity through a shared interaction mechanism. This mechanism was developed as part of CollEagle, an interactive tabletop system that supports shared externalisation practices by offering a low-effort way for users to create, curate, organise, and structure information to capture the essence of collaborative discussions. Our preliminary study highlights the potential for semantic interactivity to mediate group interactions, suggesting that the interaction approach paves the way for designing novel collaborative interfaces. We contribute our implementation and offer insights for future research to enable semantic interactivity in systems that support joint activities.</description>

      <title>Designing Hierarchical Exploratory Experiences for Ethnic Costumes: A Cultural Gene-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ethnic clothing is a vital carrier of cultural identity, yet its digital preservation often results in static displays that fail to convey deep cultural meaning or foster user engagement. Existing practices lack a systematic design framework for translating the hierarchical cultural connotations of these garments into dynamic, personalized, and identity-promoting digital experiences. To address this gap, this paper proposes a Three-Layer Cultural Gene Framework that systematically decodes ethnic costumes from their surface-level visual symbols, through their mid-level socio-cultural contexts, to their inner-layer spiritual core. Based on this framework, we designed and implemented an interactive digital platform featuring two key innovations: a "gene-first" exploratory path that encourages curiosity-driven discovery, and an AI-powered co-creation experience. This generative feature allows users to co-create personalized narratives and images based on their understanding of the "inner-layer" genes, transforming them from passive observers into active co-creators. A mixed-methods user study (N=24) was conducted to evaluate the platform. The findings demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances users' cultural cognition, deepens their affective connection, and significantly promotes their sense of cultural identity. This research contributes a validated framework and a practical exemplar for designing generative, identity-building digital experiences for cultural heritage, offering a new pathway for its preservation and revitalization in the digital age.</description>

Abstract: What better way to understand the impact of AI on software engineering than to ask AI itself? We constructed Story Arena, a multi-agent "writer's room" in which multiple AI agents, independently imbued with a position statement on the future of software engineering, converse with each other to develop a shared vision. They then use this shared vision to collaboratively construct a design fiction that depicts this vision in narrative form. We present "The Code of Trust," a short fiction that investigates themes of human comprehension, trust, content ownership, augmentation vs. replacement, and uncertain futures in human-AI co-creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore whether neural networks can decode brain activity into speech by mapping EEG recordings to audio representations. Using EEG data recorded as subjects listened to natural speech, we train a model with a contrastive CLIP loss to align EEG-derived embeddings with embeddings from a pre-trained transformer-based speech model. Building on the state-of-the-art EEG decoder from Meta, we introduce three architectural modifications: (i) subject-specific attention layers (+0.15% WER improvement), (ii) personalized spatial attention (+0.45%), and (iii) a dual-path RNN with attention (-1.87%). Two of the three modifications improved performance, highlighting the promise of personalized architectures for brain-to-speech decoding and applications in brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>Prioritize Economy or Climate Action? Investigating ChatGPT Response Differences Based on Inferred Political Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) distinguish themselves by quickly delivering information and providing personalized responses through natural language prompts. However, they also infer user demographics, which can raise ethical concerns about bias and implicit personalization and create an echo chamber effect. This study aims to explore how inferred political views impact the responses of ChatGPT globally, regardless of the chat session. We also investigate how custom instruction and memory features alter responses in ChatGPT, considering the influence of political orientation. We developed three personas (two politically oriented and one neutral), each with four statements reflecting their viewpoints on DEI programs, abortion, gun rights, and vaccination. We convey the personas' remarks to ChatGPT using memory and custom instructions, allowing it to infer their political perspectives without directly stating them. We then ask eight questions to reveal differences in worldview among the personas and conduct a qualitative analysis of the responses. Our findings indicate that responses are aligned with the inferred political views of the personas, showing varied reasoning and vocabulary, even when discussing similar topics. We also find the inference happening with explicit custom instructions and the implicit memory feature in similar ways. Analyzing response similarities reveals that the closest matches occur between the democratic persona with custom instruction and the neutral persona, supporting the observation that ChatGPT's outputs lean left.</description>

      <title>Accurate online action and gesture recognition system using detectors and Deep SPD Siamese Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network. The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO sculptures.</description>

      <title>Iceberg Sensemaking: A Process Model for Critical Data Analysis and Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04758v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer a new model of the sensemaking process for data analysis and visualization. Whereas past sensemaking models have been grounded in positivist assumptions about the nature of knowledge, we reframe data sensemaking in critical, humanistic terms by approaching it through an interpretivist lens. Our three-phase process model uses the analogy of an iceberg, where data is the visible tip of underlying schemas. In the Add phase, the analyst acquires data, incorporates explicit schemas from the data, and absorbs the tacit schemas of both data and people. In the Check phase, the analyst interprets the data with respect to the current schemas and evaluates whether the schemas match the data. In the Refine phase, the analyst considers the role of power, articulates what was tacit into explicitly stated schemas, updates data, and formulates findings. Our model has four important distinguishing features: Tacit and Explicit Schemas, Schemas First and Always, Data as a Schematic Artifact, and Schematic Multiplicity. We compare the roles of schemas in past sensemaking models and draw conceptual distinctions based on a historical review of schemas in different academic traditions. We validate the descriptive and prescriptive power of our model through four analysis scenarios: noticing uncollected data, learning to wrangle data, downplaying inconvenient data, and measuring with sensors. We conclude by discussing the value of interpretivism, the virtue of epistemic humility, and the pluralism this sensemaking model can foster.</description>

      <title>Do Vision-Language Models See Visualizations Like Humans? Alignment in Chart Categorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) hold promise for enhancing visualization tools, but effective human-AI collaboration hinges on a shared perceptual understanding of visual content. Prior studies assessed VLM visualization literacy through interpretive tasks, revealing an over-reliance on textual cues rather than genuine visual analysis. Our study investigates a more foundational skill underpinning such literacy: the ability of VLMs to recognize a chart's core visual properties as humans do. We task 13 diverse VLMs with classifying scientific visualizations based solely on visual stimuli, according to three criteria: purpose (e.g., schematic, GUI, visualization), encoding (e.g., bar, point, node-link), and dimensionality (e.g., 2D, 3D). Using expert labels from the human-centric VisType typology as ground truth, we find that VLMs often identify purpose and dimensionality accurately but struggle with specific encoding types. Our preliminary results show that larger models do not always equate to superior performance and highlight the need for careful integration of VLMs in visualization tasks, with human supervision to ensure reliable outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Composable Agentic System for Automated Visual Data Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the brittleness of monolithic AI agents, our prototype for automated visual data reporting explores a Human-AI Partnership model. Its hybrid, multi-agent architecture strategically externalizes logic from LLMs to deterministic modules, leveraging the rule-based system Draco for principled visualization design. The system delivers a dual-output: an interactive Observable report with Mosaic for reader exploration, and executable Marimo notebooks for deep, analyst-facing traceability. This granular architecture yields a fully automatic yet auditable and steerable system, charting a path toward a more synergistic partnership between human experts and AI. For reproducibility, our implementation and examples are available at https://peter-gy.github.io/VISxGenAI-2025/.</description>

      <title>AURA: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for AI-Driven Adaptive Conversational Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.076 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.</description>

      <title>InterFeedback: Unveiling Interactive Intelligence of Large Multimodal Models via Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks do not test Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on their interactive intelligence with human users, which is vital for developing general-purpose AI assistants. We design InterFeedback, an interactive framework, which can be applied to any LMM and dataset to assess this ability autonomously. On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-Sonnet-4. Our evaluation results indicate that even the state-of-the-art LMM, OpenAI-o1, struggles to refine its responses based on human feedback, achieving an average score of less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance LMMs' capabilities to interpret and benefit from feedback.</description>

      <title>AIRepr: An Analyst-Inspector Framework for Evaluating Reproducibility of LLMs in Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate data analysis through executable code generation. Yet, data science tasks often admit multiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies, making it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their outcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical soundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable approach is to evaluate the underlying workflows-the logical plans guiding code generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether an LLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations.
  To address this, we present AIRepr, an Analyst-Inspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the reproducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework is grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated assessment. We introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies and benchmark them against standard prompting across 15 analyst-inspector LLM pairs and 1,032 tasks from three public benchmarks. Our findings show that workflows with higher reproducibility also yield more accurate analyses, and that reproducibility-enhancing prompts substantially improve both metrics. This work provides a foundation for transparent, reliable, and efficient human-AI collaboration in data science. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>GAITEX: Human motion dataset of impaired gait and rehabilitation exercises using inertial and optical sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide a cost-effective approach to assessing human movement in clinical and everyday environments. However, developing the associated classification models for robust assessment of physiotherapeutic exercise and gait analysis requires large, diverse datasets that are costly and time-consuming to collect. We present a multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic and gait-related exercises, including correct and clinically relevant variants, recorded from 19 healthy subjects using synchronized IMUs and optical marker-based motion capture (MoCap). It contains data from nine IMUs and 68 markers tracking full-body kinematics. Four markers per IMU allow direct comparison between IMU- and MoCap-derived orientations. We additionally provide processed IMU orientations aligned to common segment coordinate systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics outputs, and visualization tools for IMU-derived orientations. The dataset is fully annotated with movement quality ratings and timestamped segmentations. It supports various machine learning tasks such as exercise evaluation, gait classification, temporal segmentation, and biomechanical parameter estimation. Code for postprocessing, alignment, inverse kinematics, and technical validation is provided to promote reproducibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Are Humans as Brittle as Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The output of large language models (LLMs) is unstable, due both to non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs. This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to prompt changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Toward Engineering AGI: Benchmarking the Engineering Design Capabilities of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern engineering, spanning electrical, mechanical, aerospace, civil, and computer disciplines, stands as a cornerstone of human civilization and the foundation of our society. However, engineering design poses a fundamentally different challenge for large language models (LLMs) compared with traditional textbook-style problem solving or factual question answering. Although existing benchmarks have driven progress in areas such as language understanding, code synthesis, and scientific problem solving, real-world engineering design demands the synthesis of domain knowledge, navigation of complex trade-offs, and management of the tedious processes that consume much of practicing engineers' time. Despite these shared challenges across engineering disciplines, no benchmark currently captures the unique demands of engineering design work. In this work, we introduce EngDesign, an Engineering Design benchmark that evaluates LLMs' abilities to perform practical design tasks across nine engineering domains. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on factual recall or question answering, EngDesign uniquely emphasizes LLMs' ability to synthesize domain knowledge, reason under constraints, and generate functional, objective-oriented engineering designs. Each task in EngDesign represents a real-world engineering design problem, accompanied by a detailed task description specifying design goals, constraints, and performance requirements. EngDesign pioneers a simulation-based evaluation paradigm that moves beyond textbook knowledge to assess genuine engineering design capabilities and shifts evaluation from static answer checking to dynamic, simulation-driven functional verification, marking a crucial step toward realizing the vision of engineering Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</description>

      <title>A Mega-Study of Digital Twins Reveals Strengths, Weaknesses and Opportunities for Further Improvement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital representations of individuals ("digital twins") promise to transform social science and decision-making. Yet it remains unclear whether such twins truly mirror the people they emulate. We conducted 19 preregistered studies with a representative U.S. panel and their digital twins, each constructed from rich individual-level data, enabling direct comparisons between human and twin behavior across a wide range of domains and stimuli (including never-seen-before ones). Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2). However, this apparently high accuracy was no higher than that achieved by generic personas based on demographics only. In contrast, correlation improved when twins incorporated detailed personal information, even outperforming traditional machine learning benchmarks that require additional data. Twins exhibited systematic strengths and weaknesses - performing better in social and personality domains, but worse in political ones - and were more accurate for participants with higher education, higher income, and moderate political views and religious attendance. Together, these findings delineate both the promise and the current limits of digital twins: they capture some relative differences among individuals but not yet the unique judgments of specific people. All data and code are publicly available to support the further development and evaluation of digital twin pipelines.</description>

Abstract: We present Re:Member, a system that explores how emotionally expressive, memory-grounded interaction can support more engaging second language (L2) learning. By drawing on users' personal videos and generating stylized spoken questions in the target language, Re:Member is designed to encourage affective recall and conversational engagement. The system aligns emotional tone with visual context, using expressive speech styles such as whispers or late-night tones to evoke specific moods. It combines WhisperX-based transcript alignment, 3-frame visual sampling, and Style-BERT-VITS2 for emotional synthesis within a modular generation pipeline. Designed as a stylized interaction probe, Re:Member highlights the role of affect and personal media in learner-centered educational technologies.</description>

      <title>How Do AI Agents Do Human Work? Comparing AI and Human Workflows Across Diverse Occupations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.</description>

Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on the object's geometry and functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</description>
