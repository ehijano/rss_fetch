      <title>Altermagnetism imaged and controlled down to the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a broad spectrum of fundamental research and practical device applications. The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal ($\cal{T}$) symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net-magnetization also imposes severe limitations on compatibility with other prominent phases ranging from superconductors to topological insulators, as well as on spintronic device scalability. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to this restriction, since it shares the enabling $\cal{T}$-symmetry breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net-magnetization. To date, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale imaging and control of altermagnetic ordering ranging from nanoscale vortices to domain walls to microscale single-domain states in MnTe. We combine the $\cal{T}$-symmetry breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy, to achieve detailed imaging of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A rich variety of spin configurations can be imposed using microstructure patterning or thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and control of altermagnetism paves the way for future research ranging from ultra-scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices, to the interplay of altermagnetism with non-dissipative superconducting or topological phases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Ionic Conductivity of ceramic Na3Zr2Si2PO12 via NaI Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high ionic conducting sodium superionic conductor Na3Zr2Si2PO12 -NaI composites have been prepared successfully via solid state reaction route. As the NaI content increases, the ionic conductivity significantly changes. The composites with 4% NaI show a maximum ionic conductivity of ~ 3 x 10-4 {\Omega}-1cm-1 at 200oC which is one order of magnitude rise as compared to pristine sample. Further crystal structure and surface morphology also reveal the formation of a glassy phase due to the presence of Na-Si-P-O-I interaction.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation in Atomistic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences. Broadly speaking, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt to learn essential physics and chemistry from a large amount of data. Consequently, because of the lack of physical or chemical principles in the functional form, the reliability of the predictions is oftentimes not guaranteed, particularly for data far out of distribution. It is critical to quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and understand how the uncertainty propagates to downstream chemical and materials applications. Herein, we review and categorize existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for atomistic ML under a united framework of probabilistic modeling with the aim of elucidating the similarities and differences between them. We also discuss performance metrics to evaluate the calibration, precision, accuracy, and efficiency of the UQ methods and techniques for model recalibration. In addition, we discuss uncertainty propagation (UP) in widely used simulation techniques in chemical and materials science, such as molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We also provide remarks on the challenges and future opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.</description>

      <title>Chemical disorder effects on the Gilbert damping of FeCo alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the local chemical environment on the Gilbert damping in the binary alloy Fe$_{100-x}$Co$_{x}$ is investigated, using computations based on density functional theory. By varying the alloy composition x as well as Fe/Co atom positions we reveal that the effective damping of the alloy is highly sensitive to the nearest neighbor environment, especially to the amount of Co and the average distance between Co-Co atoms at nearest neighbor sites. Both lead to a significant local increase (up to an order of magnitude) of the effective Gilbert damping, originating mainly from variations of the density of states at the Fermi energy. In a global perspective (i.e., making a configuration average for a real material), those differences in damping are masked by statistical averages. When low-temperature explicit atomistic dynamics simulations are performed, the impact of short-range disorder on local dynamics is observed to also alter the overall relaxation rate. Our results illustrate the possibility of local chemical engineering of the Gilbert damping, which may stimulate the study of new ways to tune and control materials aiming for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Defect-Assisted Domain Nucleation Drives Unique Exchange Bias Phenomena in $\bf{MnBi_2Te_4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the mechanism of exchange bias phenomena and the achievement of its efficient control are of great importance, as it promotes the revelation of unique exchange interactions and the development of exotic applications. However, it is challenging due to the elusive interface between magnetic phases. In this study, we report an unprecedented exchange bias phenomenon observed in ultrathin uncompensated antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. The magnitude and direction of the exchange field can be intentionally controlled by designing a magnetic field sweep protocol without a field cooling process. The combined experimental and theoretical simulation results indicate that the spin-flip process assisted by the ubiquitous defect-induced pinning domain sites with varying inner exchange interactions might give rise to the emergence and robustness of this peculiar exchange bias. The temperature and thickness dependence of the exchange bias phenomena are systematically investigated for further study and exploitation of its unique properties. This mechanism hold promise for highly tunable exchange bias in prevalent magnetic systems by engineering the properties of domain structures, and also offers promising avenues for the design of spintronic devices combing its topology based on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.</description>

      <title>High entropy effect on thermoelectric properties of nonequilibrium cubic phase of AgBiSe2-2xSxTex with x = 0-0.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver bismuth diselenide (AgBiSe2) has much attention as an efficient thermoelectric material due to its low thermal conductivity. However, AgBiSe2 exhibits multiple crystal structural transitions with temperature, and high thermoelectric performance was realized only in high-temperature cubic phase. We previously reported the stabilization of cubic phase in AgBiSe2-2xSxTex with x = 0.6-0.8 at room temperature by high-entropy-alloy (HEA) approach. The cubic HE-type AgBiSe0.8S0.6Te0.6 achieved a high ZT value of 0.8 at 748 K. In this paper, we succeeded in stabilizing the cubic phase in AgBiSe2-2xSxTex with x = 0-0.6 by ice-quenching method, and investigated the HE effect on the thermoelectric properties. Cubic AgBiSe2-2xSxTex exhibited n-type conductivity from 300 K to 10 K. We found that electronic conductivity was largely increased around room temperature with increasing the amount of S and Te, although carrier concentration showed almost the same values. The S and Te substitutions induced the variation of band structure, resulting in the carrier mobility enhancement. Furthermore, thermal conducutivity showed reduction tendency with increasing the amount of S and Te due to enhancement of phonon scattering. Simultaneous electronic conductivity increase and thermal conductivity reduction resulted in the systematic improvement of the ZT values for HE-type cubic AgBiSe2-2xSxTex.</description>

      <title>Combining Machine Learning Models with First-Principles High-Throughput Calculation to Accelerate the Search of Promising Thermoelectric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials can achieve direct energy conversion between electricity and heat, thus can be applied to waste heat harvesting and solid-state cooling. The discovery of new thermoelectric materials is mainly based on experiments and first-principles calculations. However, these methods are usually expensive and time-consuming. Recently, the prediction of properties via machine learning has emerged as a popular method in materials science. Herein, we firstly did first-principles high-throughput calculations for a large number of chalcogenides and built a thermoelectric database containing 796 compounds. Many novel and promising thermoelectric materials were discovered. Then, we trained four ensemble learning models and two deep learning models to distinguish the promising thermoelectric materials from the others for n type and p type doping, respectively. All the presented models achieve classification accuracy higher than 85% and area under the curve (AUC) higher than 0.9. Especially, the M3GNet model for n type data achieve accuracy, precision and recall all higher than 90%. Our works demonstrate a very efficient way of combining machine learning prediction and first-principles high-throughput calculations together to accelerate the discovery of advanced thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio study of the structural, elastic and dislocation properties of body-centered cubic refractory HfNbTaTiZr high entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into bcc HfNbTaTiZr refractory high entropy alloys, focusing on the $\frac{1}{2}\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocation core structures. While traditional observations in pure elements often revealed compact dislocation cores, our investigation reveals variability, including instances of compact, split, or degenerate cores. Building upon the current understanding of dislocation behavior, we propose that this observed variability may be intricately linked to the presence of chemical short-range order within the alloy. The unique composition of HfNbTaTiZr, between bcc and hcp elements, introduces a dynamic interplay influencing the dislocation core structure. In light of these findings, we discuss the implications for plasticity mechanisms in high entropy alloys. The presence of varied dislocation core structures suggests a complex interplay between local phases and short-range ordering, influencing the material's response to external stresses. This challenges the conventional understanding of dislocation-mediated plasticity and opens avenues for tailoring the mechanical properties of refractory alloys through the controlled manipulation of short-range order.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile optical control of interlayer stacking order in 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonvolatile optical manipulation of material properties on demand is a highly sought-after feature in the advancement of future optoelectronic applications. While the discovery of such metastable transition in various materials holds good promise for achieving this goal, their practical implementation is still in the nascent stage. Here, we unravel the nature of the ultrafast laser-induced hidden state in 1T-TaS2 by systematically characterizing the electronic structure evolution throughout the reversible transition cycle. We identify it as a mixed-stacking state involving two similarly low-energy interlayer orders, which is manifested as the charge density wave phase disruption. Furthermore, our comparative experiments utilizing the single-pulse writing, pulse-train erasing and pulse-pair control explicitly reveal the distinct mechanism of the bidirectional transformations -- the ultrafast formation of the hidden state is initiated by a coherent phonon which triggers a competition of interlayer stacking orders, while its recovery to the initial state is governed by the progressive domain coarsening. Our work highlights the deterministic role of the competing interlayer orders in the nonvolatile phase transition in the layered material 1T-TaS2, and promises the coherent control of the phase transition and switching speed. More importantly, these results establish all-optical engineering of stacking orders in low-dimensional materials as a viable strategy for achieving desirable nonvolatile electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Crystal rotation during alloy heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over past decades, high energy X-ray diffraction techniques at synchrotron beamline offer us the unique possibility to follow concomitantly some mechanisms on the grain level in metallic materials. Crystal rotation, as one important factor for the crystal orientation distribution, usually influences the anisotropic properties of materials. Crystal rotation has been visualized in deformation, recrystallization, and chemical reaction processes. In this study, we firstly visualized an unexpected crystal rotation during heating up of superalloys as well by in situ 3DXRD scanning microscopy which has not been previously reported yet. The crystal rotation was found to be related to the locked-in first order residual strain relief during the annealing treatment. In addition, intermittent dynamic, i.e., some individual diffraction spots from Debye-Scherrer rings appearing, disappearing, and reappearing, occurred in this study which has ever been thought to be caused by subgrain formation in deformation experiments. However, by residual strain analysis coupled with finite element simulation, we found that the intermittent dynamic is married with thermal expansion, crystal distortion, and crystal rotation as well. This finding opens a new world for deeply understanding the residual strain relief during materials, particularly metal, heating.</description>

      <title>Vacancies making jerky flow in complex alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longevity of materials, especially alloys, is crucial for enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of various applications, including gas turbines. Jerky flow, also known as dynamic strain aging effect, can indeed have a significant impact on the fatigue life of high-temperature components in gas turbines. In general, three jerky flow types, i.e., A, B and C, existed in superalloys. Type A and B, occurring at low temperature, were proved to be caused by interstitial elements, such as carbon. However, Type C serration at high temperature has not been verified directly and remains unresolved, which was unanimously agreed it is caused by the interaction between solute elements and dislocations. In this study, our new discovery challenged this mainstream axiom. We proposed that vacancies play a dominant role in inducing jerky flow instead of solute atoms. By transmission electron microscopy, we observed directly that dislocations are pinned by vacancy-type dislocation loops (PDLs) or dipoles. Our findings suggest that vacancies located at dislocation jogs are primarily responsible for pinning and unpinning of superlattice dislocations. As dislocations move and interact with vacancies, PDLs or dipoles are left behind in their path. This pinning and unpinning process is repeated as successive dislocations encounter the newly formed PDLs or dipoles, leading to the recurring fluctuations in the stress, i.e., serrated flow. Additionally, antisite defects created by Co, Cr and Ti sitting on Ni positions is postulated to facilitate vacancy formation and migration towards dislocations via nearest neighbor jumps. This study provides a new avenue to show how future alloy design can improve the fatigue life of superalloys in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured BiVO4 Photoanodes Fabricated by Vanadium-infused Interaction for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as a highly prospective material for photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, current limitations with this material lie in the difficulties in producing stable and continuous BiVO4 layers with efficient carrier transfer kinetics, thereby impeding its widespread application in water splitting processes. This study introduces a new fabrication approach that yields continuous, monoclinic nanostructured BiVO4 films, paving the way for their use as photoanodes in efficient PEC water oxidation for hydrogen production under solar light conditions. The fabrication involves the intercalation of vanadium (V) ions into Bi2O3 films at 450oC. Upon interaction with V ions, the film undergoes a transformation from tetragonal Bi2O3 to monoclinic scheelite BiVO4. This synthesis method enables the fabrication of single monoclinic phase BiVO4 films with thicknesses up to 270 nm. The engineered monoclinic BiVO4 film, devoid of any pinholes that could cause carrier loss, exhibits a robust photocurrent of 1.0 mA/cm2 at 1.23 VRHE in a neutral electrolyte, without requiring additional modifications or doping. Moreover, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) co-catalyst into the BiVO4 photoanode significantly enhances the lifetime of photogenerated holes by a factor of nine, resulting in a further elevation of the photocurrent to 2.9 mA/cm2. This remarkable PEC enhancement can be attributed to the surface state passivation by the Co-Pi co-catalyst. Our fabrication approach opens up a new facile route for producing large-scale, highly efficient BiVO4 photoanodes for PEC water splitting technology.</description>

      <title>Optical spectra of silver clusters and nanoparticles of all sizes from the TDDFT+U method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localized surface-plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of coinage-metal clusters and nanoparticles provide the basis for a great number of applications, the conception and necessary optimization of which require precise theoretical description and understanding. However, for the size range from clusters of a few atoms through nanoparticles of a few nanometers, where quantum effects and atomistic structure play a significant role, none of the methods employed to date has been able to provide high-quality spectra for all sizes. The main problem is the description of the filled shells of d electrons which influence the optical response decisively. In the present work we show that the DFT+U method, employed with real-time time-dependent density-functional theory calculations (RT-TDDFT), provides spectra in good agreement with experiment for silver clusters ranging from 4 to 923 atoms, the latter representing a nanoparticle with a diameter of 3 nm. Both the electron-hole-type discrete spectra of the smallest clusters and the broad plasmon resonances of the larger sizes are obtained. All calculations have been carried out using the same value of the effective U parameter that has been found to provide good results in bulk silver. The agreement with experiment for all sizes shows that the U parameter is surprisingly transferable. Our results open the pathway for TDDFT calculations of many practically relevant systems including clusters coupled to bio-molecules or to other nano-objects.</description>

      <title>Long-range self-hybridized exciton polaritons in two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have emerged as platforms for exciton-polaritonic studies at room temperature thanks to their excellent photoluminescence efficiency and synthetic versatility. In this work we find proof of strong exciton-photon coupling in cavities formed by the layered crystals themselves, a phenomenon known as self-hybridization effect. We use multi-layers of high quality Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites in their 2D crystalline form, benefitting from their quantum-well excitonic resonances and the strong Fabry-Perot cavity modes resulting from the total-internal-reflection at their smooth surfaces. Optical spectroscopy reveals bending of the cavity modes typical for exciton-polariton formation, and photoluminescence spectroscopy shows thickness dependent splitting of the excitonic resonance. Strikingly, local optical excitation with energy below the excitonic resonance of the flakes in photoluminescence measurements unveils coupling of light to in-plane polaritonic modes with directed propagation. These exciton-polaritons exhibit high coupling efficiencies and extremely low loss propagation mechanisms which is confirmed by finite difference time domain simulations. We therefore prove that mesoscopic 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites flakes represent an effective but simple system to study the rich physics of exciton-polaritons at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Raman signatures of the strong intra- and inter-molecular charge oscillations in bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene (BEDT-TTF) \k{appa}-phase salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First principle calculations of the Raman intensities of a (BEDT-TTF)^+_2 centrosymmetric dimer lead to a full reconsideration of the assignment of the three C=C stretching phonons in \k{appa}-phase BEDT-TTF salts. In contrast with previous interpretation, it is found that the presence of the out-of-phase coupling of the antisymmetric external C=C stretching mode has also to be taken into account. This mode, infrared-active for a single BEDT-TTF molecule, implies a strong intra-molecular charge oscillation along BEDT-TTF long molecular axis. In the consequent reassignment of the C=C spectral region, a very broad band appearing in the cross polarized Raman spectra is interpreted as due to inter -dimer electron-molecular vibration (e-mv) coupling, to be contrasted with the well known intra-dimer e-mv coupling that induces very strong infrared absorptions. Analysis of the data in term of a properly developed e-mv scheme yields an evaluation of the Hubbard parameters relevant to the so-called effective dimer model often used to interpret the physical properties of \k{appa}-BEDT-TTF salts. Finally the Raman spectra of an asymmetric (BEDT-TTF)^{+0.6} (BEDT-TTF)^{+0.4} dimer have been calculated in order to interpret the Raman spectra of the intriguing charge-ordered (CO), ferroelectric phase of \k{appa}-(BEDT-TTF)_2 Hg(SCN)_2 Cl. It turns out that in the asymmetric dimer the strong intra-dimer the e-mv induced infrared C=C stretching absorption should appear with huge intensity also in Raman. The absence of such band in the spectra of \k{appa}-(BEDT-TTF)_2 Hg(SCN)_2 Cl ferroelectric phase gives clear alternative indications about the possible CO pattern in such a phase.</description>

      <title>Coherent Transfer of Lattice Entropy via Extreme Nonlinear Phononics in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy transfer in metal halide perovskites, characterized by significant lattice anharmonicity and low stiffness, underlies the remarkable properties observed in their optoelectronic applications, ranging from solar cells to lasers. The conventional view of this transfer involves stochastic processes occurring within a thermal bath of phonons, where lattice arrangement and energy flow from higher to lower frequency modes. Here we unveil a comprehensive chronological sequence detailing a conceptually distinct, coherent transfer of entropy in a prototypical perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$Pbl$_3$. The terahertz periodic modulation imposes vibrational coherence into electronic states, leading to the emergence of mixed (vibronic) quantum beat between approximately 3 THz and 0.3 THz. We highlight a well-structured, bi-directional time-frequency transfer of these diverse phonon modes, each developing at different times and transitioning from high to low frequencies from 3 to 0.3 THz, before reversing direction and ascending to around 0.8 THz. First-principles molecular dynamics simulations disentangle a complex web of coherent phononic coupling pathways and identify the salient roles of the initial modes in shaping entropy evolution at later stages. Capitalizing on coherent entropy transfer and dynamic anharmonicity presents a compelling opportunity to exceed the fundamental thermodynamic (Shockley-Queisser) limit of photoconversion efficiency and to pioneer novel optoelectronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for stable properties amid processing fluctuations in sputter deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian optimization approach to guide the sputter deposition of molybdenum thin films, aiming to achieve desired residual stress and sheet resistance while minimizing susceptibility to stochastic fluctuations during deposition. Thin films are pivotal in numerous technologies, including semiconductors and optical devices, where their properties are critical. Sputter deposition parameters, such as deposition power, vacuum chamber pressure, and working distance, influence physical properties like residual stress and resistance. Excessive stress and high resistance can impair device performance, necessitating the selection of optimal process parameters. Furthermore, these parameters should ensure the consistency and reliability of thin film properties, assisting in the reproducibility of the devices. However, exploring the multidimensional design space for process optimization is expensive. Bayesian optimization is ideal for optimizing inputs/parameters of general black-box functions without reliance on gradient information. We utilize Bayesian optimization to optimize deposition power and pressure using a custom-built objective function incorporating observed stress and resistance data. Additionally, we integrate prior knowledge of stress variation with pressure into the objective function to prioritize films least affected by stochastic variations. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization effectively explores the design space and identifies optimal parameter combinations meeting desired stress and resistance specifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical observations on the topological nature of strained III-V semiconductors. By $k \cdot p$ perturbation, it can be shown that the strain-engineered conduction band hosts a Kramers-Weyl node at the $\Gamma$ point. It is theoretically shown a curated strain can create and then tune the sign of the topological charge. Furthermore, we outline experimental methods for both the realization and detection of strain-induced topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ordering of Ammonium Cations in NH$_4$I, NH$_4$Br and NH$_4$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The different types of magnetism arise mainly from how electrons move and interact with each other. In this work, we show how protons (H$^+$) also exhibit magnetic behavior. We measured the magnetic susceptibility of the ammonium halides and identified pronounced increases at 232 K, 233 K and 243 K for NH$_4$I, NH$_4$Br and NH$_4$Cl, respectively, which all coincide to the geometric ordering of its ammonium cations. With extensive literature establishing the fact that the ammonium cations exhibit rotational motion even towards the lowest temperatures, we take into account that the orbital motion of the protons carries a magnetic moment and find it to be larger than that of the paired electrons. Consequently, the structural phase transitions are magnetically-driven as the system attempts to lift 8-fold energy degeneracies of the proton orbitals via Jahn-Teller distortions. Our findings identify that NH$_4$$^+$ cations are capable of comprising magnetism which appears to be ubiquitous in ammonia-based molecular solids.</description>

      <title>Crystal orbital overlap population based on all-electron ab initio simulation with numeric atom-centered orbitals and its application to chemical-bonding analysis in Li-intercalated layered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal Orbital Overlap Population (COOP) is one of the effective tools for chemical-bonding analysis, and thus it has been utilized in the materials development and characterization. In this study, we developed a code to perform the COOP-based chemical-bonding analysis based on the wavefunction obtained from a first principles all-electron calculation with numeric atom-centered orbitals. The chemical-bonding analysis using the developed code was demonstrated for F2 and Si. Furthermore, we applied the method to analyze the chemical-bonding changes associated with a Li intercalation in three representative layered materials: graphite, MoS2, and ZrNCl, because of their great industrial importance, particularly for the applications in battery and superconducting materials. The COOP analysis provided some insights for understanding the intercalation mechanism and the stability of the intercalated materials from a chemical-bonding viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric Coupling Based on Protons in Ammonium Sulfate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most ferroelectric crystals have their own set of unique characteristics and ammonium sulfate (NH$_4$)$_2$SO$_4$ is no exception. We report on two previously unidentified features in ammonium sulfate: 1) that there are at least two successive transitions instead of one occurring at the Curie temperature $T$$_C$ = 223 K according to dielectric constant measurements; and 2) pronounced step-like anomalies are found in the magnetic susceptibility exactly at $T$$_C$. To explain these results, we take into account that there exists a previously unidentified linear coupling between the magnetic and electric dipole moments of the NH$_4$$^+$ tetrahedra due to their rapid reorientations and distorted geometry, respectively. The magnetic moments are small, 0.0016 $\mu$$_B$ for every $C$$_3$ reorientation which involve three protons (H$^+$) undergoing orbital motion. Nevertheless, short-range correlations exist in the paraelectric phase because the magnetic moments are restricted to only point along 14 possible orientations due to the symmetry and periodic nature of the potential wells. At $T$$_C$, $C$$_2$ reorientations (involving four protons) are no longer energetically feasible so the reduction in the degrees of freedom to 8 further enhances the effect of the magnetic interactions. This triggers long-range ordering of the orbital moments in an antiferromagnetic configuration along the $ab$-plane, which via Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, end up canting slightly toward the $c$-axis direction. Since there exists two types of inequivalent NH$_4$$^+$ groups that reorient at different frequencies with temperature and do not have the same degree of distortion, the emerging polar phase is ferrielectric.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of neutron induced collision cascades in Zr - statistical modelling of irradiation damage and potential applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of irradiation damage often requires a multi-scale and multi-physics approach, i.e. it requires a significant amount of information from experiments, simulations and phenomenological models. This paper focuses on the initial stages of irradiation damage, namely neutron-induced displacement cascades in zirconium, as nuclear-grade zirconium alloys are widely used in fuel assemblies. We provide results of large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on existing inter-atomic potentials and the two-temperature model to include the effect of electron-phonon coupling. Our data can be used directly in higher scale methods. Furthermore, we analysed summary statistics associated with defect production, such as the number of defects produced, their distribution and the size of clusters. As a result, we have developed a generative model of collision cascades. The model is hierarchical, as well as stochastic, i.e. it includes the variance of the considered features. This development had three main objectives: to establish a sufficient descriptor of a cascade, to develop an interpolator of data obtained from high-fidelity simulations, and to demonstrate that the statistical model of the data can generate representative distributions of primary irradiation defects. The results can be used to generate synthetic inputs for longer length- and time-scale models, as well as to build fast approximations relating dose, damage and irradiation conditions.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of the defect evolution in tungsten on successive collision cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of successive collision cascades within the same simulation domain were performed using two different inter-atomic potentials (IAP) in tungsten, one EAM based and the other a `quantum accurate' machine learning potential, SNAP. The micro-structural changes are analyzed as a function of displacements per atom (dpa) up-to irradiation dose of 3 dpa. Five simulations are carried out at primary knock-on atom (PKA) energies of 20 keV and 50 keV for observing stochastic differences in the evolution of damage. Results for the variation of the number of defects, number of defect clusters, their size and morphology distribution are compared for the two energies and two IAPs, up-to irradiation doses of 1-3 dpa.
  It is seen that for a given IAP, the number density of defect clusters as a function of dpa does not depend on the energy of the PKA used in the simulations implying that, like dpa, it could be a good measure of material property changes in irradiated materials. In contrast, the defect sizes depend strongly on the energy of the PKA. It is also seen that the micro-structure resulting from the EAM potential was mostly composed of &lt;1 1 1&gt; and &lt;1 0 0&gt; dislocations, while that from the SNAP potential was mostly composed of small, sessile, C15 ring like structures with a smattering of smaller &lt;1 1 1&gt; dislocations and very few &lt;1 0 0&gt; dislocations. The significant disagreement between the two IAPs with regard to defect morphology can be used for validation by comparing against the experimental results of dislocation types, density and size distributions.</description>

      <title>Modulating trap properties by Cr3+-doping in Zn2SiO4: Mn2+ nano phosphor for optical information storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo stimulated luminescent materials are one of the most attractive alternatives for next generation optical information storage technologies. However, there are still some challenges in regulating appropriate energy levels in luminescent materials for optical information storage. Herein, a green emission nanophosphor Zn2SiO4: Cr3+, Mn2+ with the trap depth of 1.05 eV, fulfilling the requirements for optical information storage, was fabricated for the first time through the solution combustion method and subsequent heat treatment at 1000 degree centigrade for 2h. The crystal structure, micromorphology, photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE), and afterglow properties of Zn2SiO4: xCr3+, yMn2+ were studied systematically. By applying the strategy of trap depth engineering, high trap density with proper trap depth was observed when Cr3+ ions were introduced into Zn2SiO4: Mn2+. Thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve analysis through the initial rise (IR) method was conducted to gain some insight into the information of traps. As proof of application, information storage was experimentally achieved by choosing 275 nm illumination for information writing and 980 nm NIR excitation for information reading. The results indicate that Zn2SiO4: Cr3+, Mn2+ phosphor holds promise for potential applications in the field of optical information storage.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst effect in the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_5$Si$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the off-diagonal components of the conductivity and thermoelectric tensor of materials hosting complex antiferromagnetic structures has become a viable method to reveal the effects of topology and chirality on the electronic transport in these systems. In this respect, Mn$_5$Si$_3$ is an interesting metallic compound that exhibits several antiferromagnetic phases below 100 K with different collinear and noncollinear arrangements of Mn magnetic moments. Previous investigations have shown that the transitions between the various phases give rise to large changes of the anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report measurements of the anomalous Nernst effect of Mn$_5$Si$_3$ single crystals. Below 25 K we observe a sign change of the zero-field Nernst signal with a concomitant decrease of the Hall signal and a gradual reduction of the remanent magnetization which we attribute to a subtle rearrangement of the magnetic moment configuration at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>A family of air-stable chalcogenide solid electrolytes in Li$_2$BMQ$_4$ (B = Ca, Sr and Ba; M = Si, Ge and Sn; Q = O, S and Se) systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining high-throughput first-principles calculations and experimental measurements, we have identified a novel family of fast lithium-ion chalcogenide conductors in Li$_2$BMQ$_4$ (2114, B = Ca, Sr and Ba; M = Si, Ge and Sn; Q = O, S and Se) systems. Our calculations demonstrate that most of the thermodynamically and kinetically stable sulfides and selenides in this new system exhibit ultralow Li$^+$ ion migration activation energy (0.16 eV ~ 0.56 eV) and considerable bandgaps varying between ~ 2 eV and 3.5 eV. We have successfully synthesized Li$_2$BaSnS$_4$ and Li$_2$SrSiS$_4$, and they exhibit excellent moisture stability through H$_2$S gas measurements. Electrochemical impedance measurements indicate 2114 systems show the typical features of solid ionic conductors, with a room-temperature Li$^+$ conductivity close to 5$\times$10$^{-4}$ mS/cm aligning with our molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we have theoretically investigated the substitution of Cl$^-$ at S$^{2-}$ site. The doped compounds display significantly higher conductivity, with an increase of about three orders of magnitude (up to a maximum of 0.72 mS/cm) compared to the undoped compounds. These findings offer valuable insights for the further exploration of potential chalcogenide solid electrolyte materials with robust air stability and enhanced ionic conductivity for practical applications in lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the structure and dielectric properties of ternary A6B2O17 (A = Zr; B = Nb, Ta) thin films and ceramics. Thin films are produced via sputter deposition from dense, phase-homogenous bulk ceramic targets, which are synthesized through a reactive sintering process at 1500 {\deg}C. Crystal structure, microstructure, chemistry and dielectric properties are characterized by X-ray diffraction and reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and capacitance analysis respectively. We observe relative permittivities approaching 60 and loss tangents &lt; 10^-2 across the 10^3-10^5 Hz frequency range in the Zr6Nb2O17 and Zr6Ta2O17 phases. These observations create an opportunity space for this novel class of disordered oxide electroceramics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, recently spotlighted in condensed matter physics, presents captivating physical properties and holds promise for spintronics applications. This study delves into the theoretical description and categorization of two-dimensional altermagnetism using spin group theory. Employing spin-group formalism, we establish seven distinct spin layer groups, extending beyond the conventional five spin Laue groups, to describe two-dimensional altermagnetism. Utilizing these findings, we classify previously reported two-dimensional altermagnets and identify novel materials exhibiting altermagnetism. Specifically, monolayer MnTeMoO$_6$ and VP$_2$H$_8$(NO$_4$)$_2$ are predicted to be two-dimensional altermagnets. Furthermore, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristics through symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations, substantiating their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Progress in Computational Understanding of Ferroelectric Mechanisms in HfO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first report of ferroelectricity in nanoscale HfO$_2$-based thin films in 2011, this silicon-compatible binary oxide has quickly garnered intense interest in academia and industry, and continues to do so. Despite its deceivingly simple chemical composition, the ferroelectric physics supported by HfO$_2$ is remarkably complex, arguably rivaling that of perovskite ferroelectrics. Computational investigations, especially those utilizing first-principles density functional theory (DFT), have significantly advanced our understanding of the nature of ferroelectricity in these thin films. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of the computational efforts to understand ferroelectric hafnia, comparing various metastable polar phases and examining the critical factors necessary for their stabilization. The intricate nature of HfO$_2$ is intimately related to the complex interplay among diverse structural polymorphs, dopants and their charge-compensating oxygen vacancies, and unconventional switching mechanisms of domains and domain walls, which can sometimes yield conflicting theoretical predictions and theoretical-experimental discrepancies. We also discuss opportunities enabled by machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics and phase-field simulations to go beyond DFT modeling, probing the dynamical properties of ferroelectric HfO$_2$ and tackling pressing issues such as high coercive fields.</description>

      <title>Harnessing metastability for grain size control in multiprincipal element alloys during additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling microstructure in fusion-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) remains a challenge due to numerous parameters directly impacting solidification conditions. Multiprincipal element alloys (MPEAs) offer a vast compositional design space for microstructural engineering due to their chemical complexity and exceptional properties. Here, we establish a novel alloy design paradigm in MPEAs for AM using the FeMnCoCr system. By exploiting the decreasing phase stability with increasing Mn content, we achieve notable grain refinement and breakdown of columnar grain growth. We combine thermodynamic modeling, operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction, multiscale microstructural characterization, and mechanical testing to gain insight into the solidification physics and its ramifications on the resulting microstructure. This work paves way for tailoring grain sizes through targeted manipulation of phase stability, thereby advancing microstructure control in AM.</description>

      <title>AtomGPT: Atomistic Generative Pre-trained Transformer for Forward and Inverse Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) have shown potential for various commercial applications, but their applicability for materials design remains underexplored. In this article, we introduce AtomGPT, a model specifically developed for materials design based on transformer architectures, to demonstrate the capability for both atomistic property prediction and structure generation. We show that a combination of chemical and structural text descriptions can efficiently predict material properties with accuracy comparable to graph neural network models, including formation energies, electronic bandgaps from two different methods and superconducting transition temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AtomGPT can generate atomic structures for tasks such as designing new superconductors, with the predictions validated through density functional theory calculations. This work paves the way for leveraging LLMs in forward and inverse materials design, offering an efficient approach to the discovery and optimization of materials.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing imaginary-time correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02764v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of strongly correlated materials pose a considerable challenge in condensed matter physics and chemistry. A promising approach to address this problem is quantum embedding methods. In particular, the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) maps the original system to an effective quantum impurity model comprising correlated orbitals embedded in an electron bath. The biggest bottleneck in DMFT calculations is numerically solving the quantum impurity model, i.e., computing Green's function. Past studies have proposed theoretical methods to compute Green's function of a quantum impurity model in polynomial time using a quantum computer. So far, however, efficient methods for computing the imaginary-time Green's functions have not been established despite the advantages of the imaginary-time formulation. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for computing imaginary-time Green's functions on quantum devices with limited hardware resources by applying the variational quantum simulation. Using a quantum circuit simulator, we verified this algorithm by computing Green's functions for a dimer model as well as a four-site impurity model obtained by DMFT calculations of the single-band Hubbard model, although our method can be applied to general imaginary-time correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: A lepton-neutron potential in configuration space is obtained. It is based on the Coulomb plus hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian integrated over the neutron charge and magnetic densities. Different parametrisations of the neutron electromagnetic form factors are compared. It is given in the operator form with a central, spin-spin, tensor and spin-orbit terms. The potentials for lowest partial waves states are presented. We compute the lepton-neutron lepton ($ln$) low-energy parameters for the S-waves, estimate the zero-energy cross sections for higher angular momentum states, and point out a possible divergence in the partial wave summation due to the spin-orbit potential.</description>

      <title>Quality-Weighted Vendi Scores And Their Application To Diverse Experimental Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental design techniques such as active search and Bayesian optimization are widely used in the natural sciences for data collection and discovery. However, existing techniques tend to favor exploitation over exploration of the search space, which causes them to get stuck in local optima. This ``collapse" problem prevents experimental design algorithms from yielding diverse high-quality data. In this paper, we extend the Vendi scores -- a family of interpretable similarity-based diversity metrics -- to account for quality. We then leverage these quality-weighted Vendi scores to tackle experimental design problems across various applications, including drug discovery, materials discovery, and reinforcement learning. We found that quality-weighted Vendi scores allow us to construct policies for experimental design that flexibly balance quality and diversity, and ultimately assemble rich and diverse sets of high-performing data points. Our algorithms led to a 70%-170% increase in the number of effective discoveries compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Triboelectric Pixels as building blocks for microscale and large area integration of drop energy harvesters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate step towards the exploitation of water as a clean and renewable energy source addresses the energies stored in the low frequencies of liquid flows, which demands flexible solutions to adapt to multiple scenarios, from raindrops to waves, including water moving in pipelines and microdevices. Thus, harvesting low-frequency flows is a young concept compared to solar and wind powers, where triboelectric nanogenerators have been revealed as the most promising relevant actors. However, despite widespread attempts by researchers, the drop energy harvesters' output power is still low, mainly because of the limitations in candidates endowed with ideal triboelectric and wetting properties and also the non-optimal and centimetre-scale device architecture that prevents the conversion of the complete kinetic energy of impinging drops. Herein, we disclose a microscale triboelectric nanogenerator that can harvest a high density of electrical power from drops through a single, submillisecond, long-lasting step. The mechanism relies on an instantaneous electrical capacitance variation owing to the high-speed contact of the drops with the electrodes' active area. We discuss the role of the precharged effect of the triboelectric surface in the time characteristic of the conversion event. The capacitive and microscale structure of the device is endowed with a small form factor that allows for the production of densely packed arrays. The proposed architecture can be adjusted to different liquids and scales and is compatible with a variety of triboelectric surfaces, including flexible, transparent, and thin-film approaches.</description>

      <title>Site-Controlled Purcell-Induced Bright Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are essential elementary building blocks for enabling future on-chip quantum photonic technologies that operate at room temperature. However, fundamental challenges, such as managing non-radiative decay, competing incoherent processes, as well as engineering difficulties in achieving deterministic placement and scaling of the emitters, limit their full potential. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate large-area arrays of plasmonic nanoresonators for Purcell-induced site-controlled SPEs by engineering emitter-cavity coupling and enhancing radiative emission at room temperature. The plasmonic nanoresonator architecture consists of gold-coated silicon pillars capped with an alumina spacer layer, enabling a 10-fold local field enhancement in the emission band of native hBN defects. Confocal photoluminescence and second-order autocorrelation measurements show bright SPEs with sub-30 meV bandwidth and a saturated emission rate of more than 3.8 million counts per second. We measure a Purcell factor of 4.9, enabling average SPE lifetimes of 480 ps, a five-fold reduction as compared to emission from gold-free devices, along with an overall SPE yield of 21%. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the beneficial role of an alumina spacer between defected hBN and gold, as an insulating layer can mitigate the electronic broadening of emission from defects proximal to gold. Our results offer arrays of bright, heterogeneously integrated quantum light sources, paving the way for robust and scalable quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting the impact of water transport on carbonation-induced corrosion in variably saturated reinforced concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modelling framework for predicting carbonation-induced corrosion in reinforced concrete is presented. The framework constituents include a new model for water transport in cracked concrete, a link between corrosion current density and water saturation, and a theory for characterising concrete carbonation. The theoretical framework is numerically implemented using the finite element method and model predictions are extensively benchmarked against experimental data. The results show that the model is capable of accurately predicting carbonation progress, as well as wetting and drying of cracked and uncracked concrete, revealing a very good agreement with independent experiments from a set of consistent parameters. In addition, insight is gained into the evolution of carbonation penetration and corrosion current density under periodic wetting and drying conditions. Among others, we find that cyclic wetting periods significantly speed up the carbonation progress and that the induced corrosion current density is very sensitive to concrete saturation.</description>

      <title>Compactification of Determinant Expansions via Transcorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although selected configuration interaction (SCI) algorithms can tackle much larger Hilbert spaces than the conventional full CI (FCI) method, the scaling of their computational cost with respect to the system size remains inherently exponential. Additionally, inaccuracies in describing the correlation hole at small interelectronic distances lead to the slow convergence of the electronic energy relative to the size of the one-electron basis set. To alleviate these effects, we show that the non-Hermitian, transcorrelated (TC) version of SCI significantly compactifies the determinant space, allowing to reach a given accuracy with a much smaller number of determinants. Furthermore, we note a significant acceleration in the convergence of the TC-SCI energy as the basis set size increases. The extent of this compression and the energy convergence rate are closely linked to the accuracy of the correlation factor used for the similarity transformation of the Coulombic Hamiltonian. Our systematic investigation of small molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets illustrates the magnitude of these effects.</description>

      <title>Chain-length-dependent correlated molecular motion in polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how dynamic heterogeneities (DH), a hallmark of glass-forming materials, depend on chain flexibility and chain length in polymers. For highly flexible polymers, a relatively large number of monomers ($N_c\sim500$) undergo correlated motion at the glass transition temperature $T_g$, independent of molecular weight ($M$). In contrast, less flexible polymers show a complex $N_c(M)$ behaviour divided into three regimes, consistent with observation in both $T_g(M)$ and chain conformational structure. For short oligomers ($\lesssim$ 2 Kuhn steps), a transition from mainly $\it{inter}$molecular correlations and $N_c\sim 200$, to strongly $\it{intra}$molecular correlations and $N_c&lt; 50$ (roughly the molecular size) is observed; for longer chains, $N_c$ increases weakly, before saturating. For poly(methyl methacrylate), a remarkable similarity is found between $N_c(M)$ and the $M$-dependent ratio of the activation barriers of the structural ($\alpha$) and secondary ($\beta$) relaxations. Our results suggest a link between the DH length-scale and the number of $\beta$ relaxation events jointly-activated to facilitate the $\alpha$ relaxation.</description>

      <title>Projected gradient descent algorithm for $\textit{ab initio}$ crystal structure relaxation under a fixed unit cell volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with $\textit{ab initio}$ crystal structure relaxation under a fixed unit cell volume, which is a step in calculating the static equations of state and forms the basis of thermodynamic property calculations for materials. The task can be formulated as an energy minimization with a determinant constraint. Widely used line minimization-based methods (e.g., conjugate gradient method) lack both efficiency and convergence guarantees due to the nonconvex nature of the feasible region as well as the significant differences in the curvatures of the potential energy surface with respect to atomic and lattice components. To this end, we propose a projected gradient descent algorithm named PANBB. It is equipped with (i) search direction projections onto the tangent spaces of the nonconvex feasible region for lattice vectors, (ii) distinct curvature-aware initial trial step sizes for atomic and lattice updates, and (iii) a nonrestrictive line minimization criterion as the stopping rule for the inner loop. It can be proved that PANBB favors theoretical convergence to equilibrium states. Across a benchmark set containing 223 structures from various categories, PANBB achieves average speedup factors of approximately 1.41 and 1.45 over the conjugate gradient method and direct inversion in the iterative subspace implemented in off-the-shelf simulation software, respectively. Moreover, it normally converges on all the systems, manifesting its unparalleled robustness. As an application, we calculate the static equations of state for the high-entropy alloy AlCoCrFeNi, which remains elusive owing to 160 atoms representing both chemical and magnetic disorder and the strong local lattice distortion. The results are consistent with the previous calculations and are further validated by experimental thermodynamic data.</description>

      <title>Importance of Gas Heating in Capacitively Coupled Radiofrequency Plasma-assisted Synthesis of Carbon Nanomaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of diamond nanoparticles, a capacitively-coupled radio frequency (CCRF) flow-through plasma reactor was operated with methane argon gas mixtures. Signatures of the final product obtained microscopically and spectroscopically indicated that the product was an amorphous form of graphite. This result was consistent irrespective of combinations of the macroscopic reactor settings. To explain the observed synthesis output, measurements of C2 and gas properties were carried out by laser-induced fluorescence and optical emission spectroscopy. Strikingly, the results indicated a strong gas temperature gradient of 100 K per mm from the center of the reactor to the wall. Based on additional plasma imaging, a model of hot constricted region (filamentation region) was then formulated. It illustrated that, while the hot constricted region was present, the bulk of the gas was not hot enough to facilitate diamond sp3 formation: characterized by much lower reaction rates, when compared to sp2, sp3 formation kinetics are expected to become exponentially slow. This result was further confirmed by experiments under identical conditions but with a H2/CH4 mixture, where no output material was detected: if graphitic sp2 formation was expected as the main output material from the methane feedstock, atomic hydrogen would then be expected to etch it away in situ, such that the net production of that sp2-hybridized solid material is nearly a zero.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the prediction performance of a Convolutional Neural Network evaluating the surface elastic energy of a strained film</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Deep Learning approach is devised to estimate the elastic energy density $\rho$ at the free surface of an undulated stressed film. About 190000 arbitrary surface profiles h(x) are randomly generated by Perlin noise and paired with the corresponding elastic energy density profiles $\rho(x)$, computed by a semi-analytical Green's function approximation, suitable for small-slope morphologies. The resulting dataset and smaller subsets of it are used for the training of a Fully Convolutional Neural Network. The trained models are shown to return quantitative predictions of $\rho$, not only in terms of convergence of the loss function during training, but also in validation and testing, with better results in the case of the larger dataset. Extensive tests are performed to assess the generalization capability of the Neural Network model when applied to profiles with localized features or assigned geometries not included in the original dataset. Moreover, its possible exploitation on domain sizes beyond the one used in the training is also analyzed in-depth. The conditions providing a one-to-one reproduction of the ground-truth $\rho(x)$ profiles computed by the Green's approximation are highlighted along with critical cases. The accuracy and robustness of the deep-learned $\rho(x)$ are further demonstrated in the time-integration of surface evolution problems described by simple partial differential equations of evaporation/condensation and surface diffusion.</description>

      <title>Calculated Unconventional Superconductivity via Charge Fluctuations in Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons on Kagome lattice exhibit a wealth of features including Dirac points, van Hove singularities and flatbands. When the Fermi level is placed at the van Hove saddle point, the Fermi surface is perfectly nested and a rich variety of electronic instabilities is known to occur. The material realization of such scenario is a recently discovered Kagome system CsV3Sb5 whose superconductivity near charge-density wave instability at low temperatures points to an unconventional, non-electron-phonon, pairing mechanism. Here we use a recently developed combination of density functional theory with momentum and frequency-resolved self-energies deduced from the so-called fluctuational-exchange-type random phase approximation to study charge fluctuation mediated pairing tendencies in CsV3Sb5. Based on our numerical diagonalization of the BCS gap equation, two competing solutions emerge from these calculations with A_{1g} (anisotropic s-wave-like) and B_{2g} (d_{x2-y2},d_{xy}-like) symmetries of the superconducting order parameter. Our evaluated Eliashberg spectral functions {\alpha}2F({\omega}) are purely due to electronic correlations; they were found to be strongly peaked in the vicinity of frequency 7 meV that sets the scale of charge fluctuations. The superconducting coupling constants for the leading pairing channels are estimated as a function of the nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction V, a well-known prime parameter of the extended Hubbard model. They were found in the range of 0.2-0.4 depending on V. We evaluate the superconducting T_{c} close to the values that are observed experimentally that point to the charge fluctuations to provide a substantial contribution to the pairing mechanism in CsV3Sb5.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a predictive approach for determining fracture nucleation in thermosets based on shortest paths (SPs) of the network topology. This method enumerates SP sets in networks with periodic boundary conditions, with applications to both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations. We find that network fracture is most likely to nucleate on the first (shortest) SP and the strain at nucleation is linearly correlated with the topological path length. Subsequent fracture events are dictated by the instantaneous SP of partially broken networks. We further quantify the length scale dependence of SP distributions, introducing a means of bridging simulated and experimental fracture profiles.</description>

Abstract: A vortex, a circulating flow around a void, is one of the basic topological phenomena in nature. Here we show that vortices generally emerge in spin wave travelling upon topologically nontrivial magnetic texture, due to the transverse precession of spin wave about the background magnetization. The winding number of each spin wave vortex is equivalent to sign of the local topological density of magnetic texture at the vortex core, and all winding numbers add up as twice the topological number of the magnetic texture. Based on the charts of spin wave vortices, the magnetization profile of the magnetic texture is reversely constructed, and a universal relation for the magnon topological Hall angle is theoretically proposed and numerically confirmed in vast types of magnetic textures. The simple connection between dynamic and static magnetizations, promotes spin wave vortex as a powerful tool to reveal the topology of the underlying magnetic texture.</description>

Abstract: Ultralow dimensionality of 2D layers magnifies their sensitivity to adjacent charges enabling even postprocessing electric control of multifunctional structures. However, functionalizing 2D layers remains an important challenge for on-demand device property exploitation. Here we report that an electrical and even fully optical way to control and write modifications to the magnetoresistive response of CVD-deposited graphene is achievable through the electrostatics of the photoferroelectric substrate. For electrical control, the ferroelectric polarization switch modifies graphene magnetoresistance by 67% due to a Fermi level shift with related modification in charge mobility. A similar function is also attained entirely by the bandgap light due to the substrate photovoltaic effect. Moreover, an all-optical way to imprint and recover graphene magnetoresistance by light is reported as well as magnetic control of graphene transconductance. These findings extend photoferroelectric control in 2D structures to new a magnetic dimension and advance wireless operation for sensors and field-effect transistors.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the structure of matter or materials and interaction or correlations among the constituent elementary particles are the central tasks of all branches of science, from physics, chemistry, to biology. In physics, this ultimate goal has spurred a constant search for high-order correlated entities or composite particles for nearly all states and forms of matter, from elementary particles, nuclei, cold atoms, to condensed matter. So far, such composite particles involving two or three constituent particles have been experimentally identified, such as the Cooper pairs, excitons, and trions in condensed matter physics, or diquarks and mesons in quantum chromodynamics. Although the four-body irreducible entities have long been predicted theoretically in a variety of materials systems alternatively as quadruplons, quadrons, or quartets, the closely related experimental observation so far seems to be restricted to the field of elementary particles (e.g. the recent tetraquark at CERN) only. In this article, we present the first experimental evidence for the existence of a four-body irreducible entity, the quadruplon, involving two electrons and two holes in a monolayer of Molybdenum Ditelluride. Using the optical pump-probe technique, we discovered a series of new spectral features that are distinct from those of trions and bi-excitons. By solving the four-body Bethe-Salpeter equation in conjunction with the cluster expansion approach, we are able to explain these spectral features in terms of the four-body irreducible cluster or the quadruplons. In contrast to a bi-exciton which consists of two weakly bound excitons, a quadruplon consists of two electrons and two holes without the presence of an exciton.</description>

      <title>Crystal anisotropy implications on the intrinsic magnetic and optical properties in van der Waals FePS3</title>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) FePS3 has gained significant interest recently for its potential applications in spin-related devices. A single layer is comprised of a honeycomb network, stabilized by long-range spin-exchange interactions, with a zigzag or Neel arrangement of the Fe-atoms. This study exposed, for the first time, a strong impact of lateral crystal distortion on the magnetic arrangement and optical properties of FePS3. This impact was deciphered by correlating photoluminescence (PL) observations with single-crystal XRD which uncovered anisotropy in the a/b crystallographic plane. Thus, induceing a breakage in the inversion symmetry in FePS3 causing changes in it's electronic and optical transitions. The MPL observations exhibited an unexpected band-edge circularly polarized recombination emission, while off-band-edge transitions were linearly polarized. Also, temperature-dependent MPL measurements reflected zigzag-AFM at low temperatures and the coexistence of zigzag or Neel at mid temperatures. Theoretical calculation implementing anisotropy in spin-exchange interactions among Fe atom's nearest neighbors revealed stabilized zigzag arrangement tilted away from the a-axis. Furthermore, DFT calculations of the electronic band-edge predicted split states in degenerate symmetric points (K+/K-) for zigzag structure and non-degenerate for the Neel arrangement. Highlighting the importance of the inclusion of a crystallographic anisotropy parameter for the simulation of the experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of defect excitations in crystalline solids is necessary to understand the macroscopic low-energy properties of elastic media. We use fracton-elasticity duality to systematically study the defect dynamics and interactions in the linear isotropic medium. We derive the explicit expressions for the dual gauge potentials for moving dislocations and the resulting Jefimenko equations. We also compute stresses and strains. The paper includes two physical situations: when the vacancy number is fixed and when the number is fluctuating. If defects are present we show a constraint that needs to be satisfied by them when they climb perpendicularly to their Burgers vector. Next, we extend the classic result of Peach and Koehler for the force between two dislocations and show that, similarly, to moving charges in electrodynamics, it is non-reciprocal, when one dislocation is moving. We argue that our formalism can be extended beyond Cauchy's elasticity by exploiting the simplifications provided by the dual gauge formulation of elastic stresses.</description>

Abstract: Atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) is a standard tool to model the magnetization dynamics of a variety of materials. The fundamental dynamical model underlying ASD is entirely classical. In this paper, we present two approaches to effectively incorporate quantum effects into ASD simulations, thus enhancing their low temperature predictions. The first allows to simulate the magnetic behavior of a quantum spin system by solving the equations of motion of a classical spin system at an effective temperature relative to the critical temperature. This effective temperature is determined a priori from the microscopic properties of the system. The second approach is based on a \semi model where classical spins interact with an environment with a quantum-like power spectrum. The parameters that characterize this model can be calculated ab initio or extracted from experiments. This semi-classical model quantitatively reproduces the absolute temperature behavior of a magnetic system, thus accounting for the quantum mechanical aspects of its dynamics, even at low temperature. The methods presented here can be readily implemented in current ASD simulations with no additional complexity cost.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the profound impact of correlation effects and crystal imperfections is essential for an accurate description of solids. Here we study the role of correlation, disorder, and multi-magnon processes in THz magnons. Our findings reveal that a significant part of the electron self-energy, which goes beyond the adiabatic local spin density approximation, arises from the interaction between electrons and a virtual magnon gas. This interaction leads to a substantial modification of the exchange splitting and a renormalization of magnon energies, in agreement with the experimental data. We establish a quantitative hierarchy of magnon relaxation processes based on first principles.</description>

      <title>Weak effects of electron-phonon interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of wurtzite GaN with high electron concentrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has great potential for high-frequency and high-power applications due to its excellent electrical and thermal transport properties. However, enhancing the performance of GaN-based power electronics relies on heavy doping. Previous studies showed that electron-phonon interactions have strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity of GaN due to the Fr\"ohlich interaction. Surprisingly, our investigation reveals weak effects of electron-phonon interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of n-type GaN at ultra-high electron concentrations and the impact of the Fr\"ohlich interaction can be ignored. The small phonon-electron scattering rate is attributed to the limited scattering channels, quantified by the Fermi surface nesting function. In contrast, there is a significant reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of p-type GaN at high hole concentrations due to the relatively larger Fermi surface nesting function. Meanwhile, as p-type GaN has relatively smaller electron-phonon matrix elements, the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity is still weaker than that observed in p-type silicon. Our work provides a deep understanding of thermal transport in doped GaN and the conclusions can be further extended to other wide-bandgap semiconductors, including $\beta$-Ga2O3, AlN, and ZnO.</description>

Abstract: The use of semiconductor nanocrystals in scalable quantum technologies requires characterization of the exciton coherence dynamics in an \emph{ensemble} of electronically isolated crystals in which system-bath interactions are nevertheless strong. In this communication, we identify signatures of Fano-like interference between excitons and photocarriers in the coherent two-dimensional photoluminescence excitation spectral lineshapes of mixed lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals in dilute solution. Specifically, by tuning the femtosecond-pulse spectrum, we show such interference in an intermediate coupling regime, which is evident in the coherent lineshape when simultaneously exciting the exciton and the free-carrier band at higher energy. We conclude that this interference is an intrinsic effect that will be consequential in the quantum dynamics of the system and will thus dictate decoherence dynamics, with consequences in their application in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: The static electric dipole-dipole coupling between donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors has recently emerged as a means of realizing a quantum science platform through optically controllable, long-range interactions between defects in the solid state. In this work, we generalize DAPs to consider arbitrary dopant populations and demonstrate that the charge of the NV center in diamond is well suited for quantum science. Explicitly, we leverage experimental results [see Z. Yuan et al., PRR 2, 033263 (2020)] to show that shallow NV centers can be efficiently initialized to a given relative population of the negative and neutral charge states and that modulating the surface termination would allow for control of the timescale over which the initialization and subsequent computations would occur. Furthermore, we argue that the observation of electroluminescence from the neutral charge state of the NV center [see N. Mizuochi et al., Nat. Photon. 6, 299 (2012)], but not from the negative charge state, implies the ability to interface with the NV center's charge in a manner analogous to the spin interface enabled by the spin-state dependent fluorescence of the NV center.</description>

Abstract: Over the last two decades, the new branch of spintronics, i.e., semiconductor spintronics, has gained more attention because it integrates the characteristics of conventional semiconductors, such as optical bandgap and charge carriers, helpful for processing and computing pieces of information combined with magnets for data storage applications in a single device. Likewise, substituting transition metal (TM) ions to induce magnetic qualities into semiconductors or oxides creates dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) or oxides (DMOs) with high electronic, photonic, and magnetic functionality. This review article discusses the historical outline of magnetic semiconductors with their origin and mechanism. It also includes a concise overview of various DMO systems based on their conductivity (p-type and n-type) to elucidate the synthesis, origin, and control mechanisms and further evoke the prepared spintronics devices. The occurrence of RTFM with transparency and conductivity can be helpful in spintronics device fabrications, which was assumed to be governed by the formation of intrinsic defects, charge carriers, morphology, and the induced exchange interactions between ions. The DMOs-based spintronics devices, such as magneto-optical devices, transparent ferromagnets, and spin-based solar cells, exploit both semiconducting and magnetic properties, which have also been discussed in this review article with outlook and perspectives.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

Abstract: The rise of electron microscopy has expanded our ability to acquire nanometer and atomically resolved images of complex materials. The resulting vast datasets are typically analyzed by human operators, an intrinsically challenging process due to the multiple possible analysis steps and the corresponding need to build and optimize complex analysis workflows. We present a methodology based on the concept of a Reward Function coupled with Bayesian Optimization, to optimize image analysis workflows dynamically. The Reward Function is engineered to closely align with the experimental objectives and broader context and is quantifiable upon completion of the analysis. Here, cross-section, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of ion-irradiated $(Y, Dy)Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ thin-films were used as a model system. The reward functions were formed based on the expected materials density and atomic spacings and used to drive multi-objective optimization of the classical Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) method. These results can be benchmarked against the DCNN segmentation. This optimized LoG* compares favorably against DCNN in the presence of the additional noise. We further extend the reward function approach towards the identification of partially-disordered regions, creating a physics-driven reward function and action space of high-dimensional clustering. We pose that with correct definition, the reward function approach allows real-time optimization of complex analysis workflows at much higher speeds and lower computational costs than classical DCNN-based inference, ensuring the attainment of results that are both precise and aligned with the human-defined objectives.</description>

Abstract: We study the phase transition behavior of the ferroelectric BaTi$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_3$ in the paraelectric region. The temperature dependencies of thermal, polar, elastic and dielectric properties indicate the presence of local structures above the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature Tc = 292 K. The non-zero remnant polarization is measured up to a characteristic temperature T* ~350 K, which coincides with the temperature where the dielectric constant deviates from Curie-Weiss law. Resonant Piezoelectric Spectroscopy shows that DC field-cooling above Tc using fields smaller than the coercive field leads to an elastic response and remnant piezoelectricity below T*, which likely corresponds to the coherence temperature associated with polar nanostructures in ferroelectrics. The observed remnant effect is attributed to the reorientation of polar nanostructures above Tc.</description>

Abstract: Protected surface states arising from non-trivial bandstructure topology in semimetals can potentially enable new device functionalities in compute, memory, interconnect, sensing, and communication. This necessitates a fundamental understanding of surface-state transport in nanoscale topological semimetals. Here, we investigate quantum transport in a prototypical topological semimetal NbAs to evaluate the potential of this class of materials for beyond-Cu interconnects in highly-scaled integrated circuits. Using density functional theory (DFT) coupled with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, we show that the resistance-area RA product in NbAs films decreases with decreasing thickness at the nanometer scale, in contrast to a nearly constant RA product in ideal Cu films. This anomalous scaling originates from the disproportionately large number of surface conduction states which dominate the ballistic conductance by up to 70% in NbAs thin films. We also show that this favorable RA scaling persists even in the presence of surface defects, in contrast to RA sharply increasing with reducing thickness for films of conventional metals, such as Cu, in the presence of surface defects. These results underscore the promise of topological semimetals like NbAs as future back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnect metals.</description>

      <title>Estimation of fatigue life of TiN coatings using cyclic micro-impact testing</title>

Abstract: This paper studies the behaviour of a thin titanium nitride (TiN) coating (1.5 um thick) on a tool steel substrate material under dynamic and cyclic impacts through an approach combining experimental testing and computational modelling. Dynamic impact testing was used to investigate the load-dependent dynamic hardness and assess the energy-dissipation capabilities of the coating system. In cyclic impact tests, the materials experienced permanent plastic deformation in each cycle, ultimately leading to coating failure. Chemical analysis identified an interlayer between the coating and the substrate, while cross-sectional analysis revealed the extent of coating damage due to cycling and impact load. A three-dimensional map was constructed, connecting the acceleration load, sensed depth, and cycles to the coating failure, and an empirical equation used to characterize the relationship between the depth and cycles to failure. The computational model examined the traction component distribution during loading and unloading, with a focus on normal and shear tractions. These findings suggested the potential significance of normal traction in the interfacial fatigue failure due to impact.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Multivariable Regression for Material Property Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increased use of data-driven approaches and machine learning-based methods in material science, the importance of reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the predicted variables for informed decision-making cannot be overstated. UQ in material property prediction poses unique challenges, including the multi-scale and multi-physics nature of advanced materials, intricate interactions between numerous factors, limited availability of large curated datasets for model training, etc. Recently, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for UQ, offering a probabilistic framework for capturing uncertainties within neural networks. In this work, we introduce an approach for UQ within physics-informed BNNs, which integrates knowledge from governing laws in material modeling to guide the models toward physically consistent predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we present case studies for predicting the creep rupture life of steel alloys. Experimental validation with three datasets of collected measurements from creep tests demonstrates the ability of BNNs to produce accurate point and uncertainty estimates that are competitive or exceed the performance of the conventional method of Gaussian Process Regression. Similarly, we evaluated the suitability of BNNs for UQ in an active learning application and reported competitive performance. The most promising framework for creep life prediction is BNNs based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior distribution of network parameters, as it provided more reliable results in comparison to BNNs based on variational inference approximation or related NNs with probabilistic outputs.

      <title>Quantum oscillations in kagome metals (Ti, Zr, Hf)V6Sn6 at Van Hove filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials have recently drawn great attention due to the interplay between nontrivial band topology, electron correlations, and Van Hove singularities related many-body orders. Here we report three new vanadium-based kagome metals, TiV6Sn6, ZrV6Sn6, and HfV6Sn6, and conduct a comprehensive investigation of their structural, magnetic, and electrical transport properties. All three compounds exhibit large unsaturated magnetoresistances and multiband Hall effects at low temperatures, indicating the existence of multiple highly mobile carriers. Both the diagonal and off-diagonal resistivity show quantum oscillations with nontrivial Berry phases and high quantum mobilities. First-principles calculations together with quantum oscillation analyses suggest the Van Hove singularities at the M point for the three compounds all located in close vicinity of the Fermi level, and there also exist multiple topological nontrivial band crossings, including a nodal ring and a massive Dirac cone. Our work extends the kagome AM6X6 family and paves the way for searching possible Van Hove physics in the V kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Transport Property of Spin-1/2 Random Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quenched disorders can strongly influence the physical properties of quantum many-body systems. The real-space strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) analysis has shown that the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain is controlled by the infinite-randomness fixed point (IRFP) and forms a random singlet (RS) ground state. Motivated by recent thermal transport experiments on the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet copper benzoate [B. Y. Pan et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 167201 (2022)], we adapt the SDRG to study the low-temperature properties of the random Heisenberg chain by assuming that its low-energy excited states are captured by the parent Hamiltonian of the RS ground state as well. We find that while the specific heat coefficient and the uniform magnetic susceptibility scale as $C/T\sim T^{-\alpha_{c}}$ and $\chi\sim T^{-\alpha_{s}}$ with $0&lt;\alpha_{c,s}&lt;1$, indicating a divergent low-energy density of states, the thermal and the spin conductivities scale as $\kappa/T\sim T$ and $\sigma_{s}\sim T$, which implies a vanishing density of extended states in the low-energy limit. We believe that such a disparity in the thermodynamic and transport properties is a common feature of random systems controlled by the IRFP.</description>

      <title>Graphene conductivity: Kubo model versus QFT-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare three available models of graphene conductivity: a non-local Kubo model, a local model derived by Falkovsky, and finally a non-local Quantum Field Theory based (QFT-b) model. The first two models are extensively used in the nanophotonic community. All these models are not ab-initio since they contain phenomenological parameters (like Fermi velocity, chemical potential and/or mass gap parameters that depend on the chosen material and possibly on external perturbations), and are supposed to provide coherent results since they are derived from the same starting Hamiltonian. While we confirm that the local model is a proper limit of the non-local Kubo model, we find some inconsistencies in the QFT-b model as derived and used in the literature. In particular, differently from the Kubo model, the QFT-b model shows a plasma-like behavior for the interband transversal conductivity at low frequencies instead of the expected behavior (an almost constant conductivity as a function of frequency $\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega &lt; \sqrt{(\hbar v_{F}q)^{2} + 4m^{2}}$). We show how to correctly regularize the QFT-b model in order to satisfy the gauge invariance and, once also losses are correctly included, we show that the Kubo and QFT-b model exactly coincide. Our finding can be of relevant interest for both theory, predictions and experimental tests in both the nanophotonic and Casimir effect communities.</description>

      <title>A $C^\ast$-algebraic view on the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interaction of real- and reciprocal space topology in skyrmion crystals is an open problem. We approach it from the viewpoint of $C^\ast$-algebras and calculate all admissible Chern numbers of a strongly coupled tight-binding skyrmion system on a triangular lattice as a function of Fermi energy and texture parameters. Our analysis reveals the topological complexity of electronic states coupled to spin textures, and the failure of the adiabatic picture to account for it in terms of emergent electromagnetism. On the contrary, we explain the discontinuous jumps in the real-space winding number in terms of collective evolution in real-, reciprocal, and mixed space Chern numbers. Our work sets the stage for further research on topological dynamics in complex dynamic spin textures coupled to external fields.</description>
