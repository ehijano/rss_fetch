      <title>Electricity Spot Prices Forecasting Using Stochastic Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are several approaches to modeling and forecasting time series as applied to prices of commodities and financial assets. One of the approaches is to model the price as a non-stationary time series process with heteroscedastic volatility (variance of price). The goal of the research is to generate probabilistic forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices in a spot marker employing stochastic volatility models. A typical stochastic volatility model - that treats the volatility as a latent stochastic process in discrete time - is explored first. Then the research focuses on enriching the baseline model by introducing several exogenous regressors. A better fitting model - as compared to the baseline model - is derived as a result of the research. Out-of-sample forecasts confirm the applicability and robustness of the enriched model. This model may be used in financial derivative instruments for hedging the risk associated with electricity trading.

      <title>A Multimodal Foundation Agent for Financial Trading: Tool-Augmented, Diversified, and Generalist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial trading is a crucial component of the markets, informed by a multimodal information landscape encompassing news, prices, and Kline charts, and encompasses diverse tasks such as quantitative trading and high-frequency trading with various assets. While advanced AI techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning are extensively utilized in finance, their application in financial trading tasks often faces challenges due to inadequate handling of multimodal data and limited generalizability across various tasks. To address these challenges, we present FinAgent, a multimodal foundational agent with tool augmentation for financial trading. FinAgent's market intelligence module processes a diverse range of data-numerical, textual, and visual-to accurately analyze the financial market. Its unique dual-level reflection module not only enables rapid adaptation to market dynamics but also incorporates a diversified memory retrieval system, enhancing the agent's ability to learn from historical data and improve decision-making processes. The agent's emphasis on reasoning for actions fosters trust in its financial decisions. Moreover, FinAgent integrates established trading strategies and expert insights, ensuring that its trading approaches are both data-driven and rooted in sound financial principles. With comprehensive experiments on 6 financial datasets, including stocks and Crypto, FinAgent significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of 6 financial metrics with over 36% average improvement on profit. Specifically, a 92.27% return (a 84.39% relative improvement) is achieved on one dataset. Notably, FinAgent is the first advanced multimodal foundation agent designed for financial trading tasks.</description>
