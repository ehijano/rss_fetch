      <title>Magnetic-field effect on excitonic condensation emergent in extended Falicov-Kimball model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>In-plane anisotropy of charge density wave fluctuations in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of anisotropic triple-$q$ charge density wave (CDW) fluctuations in the transition metal dichalcogenide 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ over a large volume of reciprocal space with X-ray diffuse scattering. Above the transition temperature, $T_{\text{CDW}}$, the out-of-plane diffuse scattering is characterized by rod-like structures which indicate that the CDW fluctuations in neighboring layers are largely decoupled. In addition, the in-plane diffuse scattering is marked by ellipses which reveal that the in-plane fluctuations are anisotropic. Our analysis of the diffuse scattering line shapes and orientations suggests that the three charge density wave components contain independent phase fluctuations. At $T_{\text{CDW}}$, long range coherence is established in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, consistent with the large observed value of the CDW gap compared to $T_{\text{CDW}}$, and the predicted presence of a hierarchy of energy scales.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Hubbard pairing in a cuprate ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is believed to capture the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that it fails to reproduce a robust and homogeneous superconducting ground state. Here, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that magnetic excitations in the prototypical cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ are inconsistent with those of a simple Hubbard model. The magnetic response of hole carriers, contributing to an emergent branch of spin excitations, is strongly suppressed. This effect is the consequence of d-wave-like pairing, enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude through a large nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. The similarity between cuprate ladders and the two-dimensional compounds suggests that such an enhanced hole pairing may be a universal feature of superconducting cuprates.</description>

      <title>Cooper-Pair Localization in the Magnetic Dynamics of a Cuprate Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin dynamics of the cuprate ladder Sr$_{2.5}$Ca$_{11.5}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ to elucidate the behavior of its intrinsically doped holes. Combining high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and density matrix renormalization group calculations enables a comprehensive analysis of the collective magnetic dynamics. We find a general absence of magnetic signatures from unpaired charges, indicating holes within the system form strongly bound localized Cooper pairs. A one-band Hubbard model fails to match the spectral features but a straightforward extension to a large attractive nearest-neighbor interaction quantitatively explains our results. Our finding shows the significance of additional interactions beyond the long-predicted quantum spin pairing in the ($d$-wave) charge pairing process. Considering the parallels between ladders and two-dimensional cuprates, these results are potentially relevant for square lattices as well.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the zigzag ladder compound SrTb2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the properties of SrTb2O4, a frustrated zigzag ladder antiferromagnet, studied by single crystal neutron diffraction (with polarised neutrons in zero field and unpolarised neutrons in an applied magnetic field), as well as by neutron spectroscopy on a polycrystalline sample. The neutron scattering results are supported by single crystal magnetisation and heat capacity measurements. In zero field, neutron diffraction data show no transition to a magnetically ordered state down to the lowest experimentally available temperature of 35 mK, and the material remains magnetically disordered down to this temperature. Polarised neutron diffraction measurements reveal the presence of a diffuse scattering signal suggesting only very weak spin-spin correlations in the ground state. For H // c (the easy magnetisation direction), we followed the magnetisation process using neutron diffraction measurements and observed the appearance of field-induced magnetic Bragg peaks with integer h and k indices in the (hk0) scattering plane. No magnetic peaks with a non-zero propagation vector were detected. The observed in-field data fit well to a simple two-sublattice model with magnetic moments aligned along the field direction but being significantly different in magnitude for the two inequivalent Tb3+ sites in the unit cell. Overall, the collected data point to a nonmagnetic ground state in SrTb2O4 despite the presence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>From strong to weak correlations in breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials: Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$ as a robust and versatile platform for many-body engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining ab initio downfolding with cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we study the degree of correlations in the low-temperature structures of the breathing-mode kagome van der Waals materials Nb$_3$(F,Cl,Br,I)$_8$. We show that the Coulomb correlation strength steadily increases from I to Br, Cl, and F, allowing us to identify Nb$_3$I$_8$ as a weakly correlated (obstructed atomic) insulator whose gap is only mildly affected by the local Coulomb interaction. Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ are strongly correlated insulators, whose gaps are significantly influenced by Coulomb-induced vertex corrections. Nb$_3$F$_8$ is a prototypical bulk Mott-insulator whose gap is initially opened by strong correlation effects. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements comparing Nb$_3$Br$_8$ and Nb$_3$I$_8$ allow us to experimentally confirm these findings by revealing spectroscopic footprints of the degree of correlation. Our calculations further predict that the entire material family can be tuned into correlated charge-transfer or Mott-insulating phases upon electron or hole doping. Our magnetic property analysis additionally shows that inter-layer magnetic frustrations in the high-temperature phase drive the lattice phase transition to the low-temperature structures. The accompanying bilayer hybridization through inter-layer dimerization yields magnetic singlet ground states in the Cl, Br, and I compounds. Our findings establish Nb$_3$X$_8$ as a robust, versatile, and tunable class for van der Waals-based Coulomb and Mott engineering and allow us to speculate on the symmetry-breaking effects necessary for the recently observed Josephson diode effect in NbSe$_2$/Nb$_3$Br$_8$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments. Our work highlights the open problems, identifies new research directions and provides a comprehensive framework for this rapidly evolving research field.</description>

      <title>A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</description>

      <title>Mapping the three-dimensional fermiology of the triangular lattice magnet EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the temperature-field phase diagram as well as present a comprehensive study of the electronic structure and three-dimensional fermiology of the triangular-lattice magnet EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, utilizing quantum oscillation measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The complex magnetic phase diagram of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ highlights many transitions through nontrivial AFM states. Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations were observed in the polarized ferromagnetic state of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, revealing three pairs of distinct spin-split frequency branches with small effective masses. A comparison of the angle-dependent oscillation data with first-principles calculations in the ferromagnetic state and angle-resolved photoemission spectra shows good agreement, identifying tubular hole pockets and hourglass-shaped hole pockets at the Brillouin zone center, as well as diamond-shaped electron pockets at the zone boundary. As the temperature increases, the frequency branches of the tiny hourglass pockets evolve into a more cylindrical shape, while the larger pockets remain unchanged. This highlights that variations in exchange splitting, driven by changes in the magnetic moment, primarily impact the small Fermi pockets without significantly altering the overall band structure. This is consistent with first-principles calculations, which show minimal changes near the Fermi level across ferromagnetic and simple antiferromagnetic states or under varying on-site Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous mapping of the ultrafast time and fluence dependence of the laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition in magnetite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pump-probe methods are a ubiquitous tool in the field of ultrafast dynamic measurements. In recent years, X-ray free-electron laser experiments have gained importance due to their ability to probe with high chemical selectivity and at atomic length scales. To obtain the complete dynamic information, measurements are typically repeated many thousands of times with varying delay and/or fluence settings. This generally necessitates that the sample fully recovers before the subsequent excitation and that probe pulses and the induced dynamic evolution are comparable to each other. These conditions present a significant challenge when the sample fluctuates between different initial states or when it is susceptible to damage. Also, source fluctuations are normally intrinsic to free-electron laser pulses. Here, we present a time-to-space mapping imaging scheme that enables us to record a delay range of several picoseconds as well as a laser fluence range of about one order of magnitude in every single shot of the x-ray probe. This approach can circumvent the aforementioned preconditions. We demonstrate the use of this scheme by mapping the femto- and picosecond dynamics of the optically induced insulator-to-metal Verwey transition in a magnetite thin film. We employ resonant diffraction at the free-electron laser FLASH for probing. The dynamics of the magnetite thin film are found to follow a biexponential decay in line with earlier studies on bulk crystals. By extrapolating our results towards the conditions found at X-ray free-electron lasers with higher energy, we demonstrate that the presented data could be recorded in a single shot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which allows simulation of Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and provides a framework that enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model and the PPP model. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate Hubbard models on hexagonal lattice fragments and periodic hexagonal lattices, analyze gate costs, and provide commutator bounds for evaluating Trotter errors, including new commutator bounds for the extended Hubbard model. We compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, which we optimize for the hexagonal lattice Hubbard model, and demonstrate that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermions and hardcore bosons share the same restriction: no more than one particle can occupy a single site in a lattice system. Specifically, in one dimension, two systems can share the same matrix representation. In this work, we investigate both the fermion and hardcore-boson models with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction in a ring lattice. We construct the exact eigenstates of the hardcore-boson model with resonant NN interaction and show that they possess off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. In comparison, the fermionic counterpart does not support such a feature due to the different particle statistics, although they share an identical energy spectrum. In addition, we examine the effect of the periodic boundary condition on the dynamics of the condensate states through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Topological charge excitations and Green's function zeros in paramagnetic Mott insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid transport and strong mass enhancement near the nematic quantum critical point in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is often accompanied by non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, which emerges near a quantum critical point (QCP) - a point where an electronic ordered phase is terminated at absolute zero under non-thermal parameters. While nematic orders, characterized by broken rotational symmetry, are sometimes found in unconventional superconductors, the role of nematic fluctuations in driving NFL transport behavior remains unclear. Here, we investigated electrical and thermoelectric transport properties in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ thin films and observed hallmark NFL behavior: temperature-linear resistivity and logarithmic divergence of thermoelectricity at low temperatures. Notably, the thermoelectricity peaks sharply at the nematic QCP ($x$ = 0.45), highlighting the dominant role of nematic fluctuations in the NFL transport. Furthermore, we found that the pair-breaking mechanisms in the superconducting phase crosses over from orbital- to Pauli-limited effects, indicating the mass enhancement near the nematic critical regime. These findings reveal the profound impact of nematic fluctuations on both normal-state transport and superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Interplay of orbital-selective Mott criticality and flat-band physics in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Correlated electronic structures and unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature $T_C$ superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system, by integrating ab initio calculations with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements, which reveal a higher-symmetry lattice. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) calculations, with cRPA calculated on-site Coulomb repulsive $U$ and experimentally measured electron filling $n$, quantitatively reproduces Fermi surfaces from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. The distinct Fermi surface topology from simple DFT+$U$ results features the indispensable role of correlation effects. Based upon the correlated electronic structures, A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach yields a pronounced $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $d_{z^{2}}$ characters. Our findings highlight the quantitative effectiveness of the DFT+cRPA+CDMFT approach that precisely determines correlated electronic structure parameters without fine-tuning. The revealed intermediate correlation effect may explain the same order-of-magnitude onset $T_C$ observed both in pressured bulk and strained thin film bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Detection and control of electronic orbital magnetism by spin waves in honeycomb ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product Density Operators: Renormalization Fixed Points and Boundary Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:1606.00608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the tensors generating matrix product states and density operators in a spin chain. For pure states, we revise the renormalization procedure introduced by F. Verstraete et al. in 2005 and characterize the tensors corresponding to the fixed points. We relate them to the states possessing zero correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate ground states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. For mixed states, we introduce the concept of renormalization fixed points and characterize the corresponding tensors. We also relate them to concepts like finite correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those which generate Gibbs states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. One of the main result of this work is that the resulting fixed points can be associated to the boundary theories of two-dimensional topological states, through the bulk-boundary correspondence introduced by Cirac et al. in 2011.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>

      <title>Floquet Schrieffer-Wolff transform based on Sylvester equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Floquet Schrieffer Wolff transform (FSWT) to obtain effective Floquet Hamiltonians and micro-motion operators of periodically driven many-body systems for any non-resonant driving frequency. The FSWT perturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian by solving operator-valued Sylvester equations with systematic approximations. It goes beyond various high-frequency expansion methods commonly used in Floquet theory, as we demonstrate with the example of the driven Fermi-Hubbard model. In the limit of high driving frequencies, the FSWT Hamiltonian reduces to the widely used Floquet-Magnus result. We anticipate this method will be useful for designing Rydberg multi-qubit gates, controlling correlated hopping in quantum simulations in optical lattices, and describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems driven in-gap.</description>

      <title>p-wave superconductivity induced by nearest-neighbor attraction in the square-lattice extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is widely believed to contain the key ingredients of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials. Here, we report a constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) study of the square-lattice extended Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb repulsion U and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron attraction V. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.125, we find that the NN electron attraction V can notably drive an exotic spin-triplet (p-wave) superconducting (SC) phase, and enhance the p-wave SC correlations with the increase of V. But in the intermediate coupling regime, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (d-wave) does not significantly increase with the increase of V, indicating that the d-wave is not affected by V in strongly correlated system. Besides the pairing phase, a spin density wave (SDW) only exists near the half-filling in the particle-hole channel, and doping disrupts the formation of SDW order. Especially, the NN electron attraction V has no significant effect on SDW, reflecting the consistent relationship between d-wave SC and spin correlation. Moreover, as doping increases, the dominant region of p-wave also expands, further suppressing the presence of d-wave, which may help explain the disappearance of d-wave SC in overdoped cuprate superconductors. We also find the d-wave exhibits a singular nonzero (near point ($2{\pi}/3, {\pi}$)) condensation structure in momentum space, resulting in a different staggered behavior in the x and y direction with distance in real space. On the contrary, the p-wave condensed at zero momentum, and the p-wave correlation exhibits exponential decay in real space. Our work suggests the p-wave SC region can be induced and further broadened by the NN electron attraction V, offering a feasible mechanism to realize p-wave superconductivity in realistic cuprate materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 114 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi level, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring the large AHE in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.</description>
