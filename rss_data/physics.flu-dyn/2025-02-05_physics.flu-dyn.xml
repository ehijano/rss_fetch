      <title>Aerosol deposition in mucus-lined ciliated airways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport and deposition of inhaled aerosols in a mid-generation, mucus-lined lung airway, with the aim of understanding if and how airborne particles can avoid the mucus and deposit on the airway wall -- an outcome that is harmful in case of allergens and pathogens but beneficial in case of aerosolized drugs. We adopt the weighted-residual integral boundary-layer model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 762, 2015, pp. 68-109) to describe the dynamics of the mucus-air interface, as well as the flow in both phases. The transport of mucus induced by wall-attached cilia is also considered, via a coarse-grained boundary condition at the base of the mucus. We show that the capillary-driven Rayleigh-Plateau instability plays an important role in particle deposition by drawing the mucus into large annular humps and leaving substantial areas of the wall exposed to particles. We find, counter-intuitively, that these mucus-depleted zones enlarge on increasing the mucus volume fraction. Particles spanning a range of sizes (0.1 to 50 microns) are modelled using the Maxey-Riley equation, augmented with Brownian forces. We find a non-monotonic dependence of deposition on size. Small particles diffuse across streamlines due to Brownian motion, while large particles are thrown off streamlines by inertial forces -- particularly when air flows past mucus humps. Intermediate-sized particles are tracer-like and deposit the least. Remarkably, increasing the mucus volume need not increase entrapment: the effect depends on particle-size, because more mucus produces not only deeper humps that intercept inertial particles, but also larger depleted-zones that enable diffusive particles to deposit on the wall.</description>

      <title>Data-driven prediction of reversal of large-scale circulation in turbulent convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale circulation (LSC) quasi-stably emerges in the turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and intermittently reverses its rotational direction in two-dimensional turbulent convection. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of the intermittent reversals of the LSC in a two-dimensional square domain are performed, and the time series of the total angular momentum indicating the rotational direction of the LSC is predicted by reservoir computing whose input consists of the shear rates and temperatures at six locations on the sidewalls. The total angular momentum in the simulation after times shorter than half the typical duration of the quasi-stable states is successfully reproduced by the locally-measurable quantities on the sidewalls because the secondary rolls accompanied by the boundary flow characterize the reversal of the LSC. The successful prediction by such sparse input derived from local measurements on the sidewalls demonstrates that the reservoir computing prediction of the reversal is feasible in laboratory experiments and industrial applications. On the other hand, long-term prediction often provides the total angular momentum opposite in sign to the one in the simulations in the late parts of long quasi-stable states. The statistical independence of each reversal implies that the prediction after the reversal is difficult or even impossible, and the training data in the late part in the long quasi-stable state, which rarely appears, is contaminated by the statistically-independent angular momentum in the subsequent quasi-stable state.</description>

      <title>Burnett-level discrete Boltzmann modeling of compressible flows under force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a Burnett-level discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) is proposed for the compressible flow in a force field, and a discrete velocity set with 25 velocities is constructed for the DBM, featuring good spatial symmetry. In the discrete Boltzmann equation, both the discrete equilibrium distribution function and the force term satisfy 25 independent moment relations and are computed with the matrix inversion method. This approach ensures high physical accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation. Through the Chapman-Enskog expansion analysis, it is demonstrated that the current DBM can recover the Burnett equations for the compressible system under force in the continuum limit. Moreover, the DBM has the capability of capturing essential thermodynamic nonequilibrium behaviors. Finally, the model is validated through five typical benchmarks, including the free falling, Sod shock tube, sound wave, thermal Couette flow, and Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure of parameter space in immiscible two-phase flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, a continuum theory of immiscible and incompressible
  two-phase flow in porous media based on generalized thermodynamic principles was
  formulated (Transport in Porous Media, 125, 565 (2018)). In this theory, two
  immiscible and incompressible fluids flowing in a porous medium are treated as
  an effective fluid, substituting the two interacting subsystems for a
  single system with an effective viscosity and pressure gradient. In assuming
  Euler homogeneity of the total volumetric flow rate and comparing the
  resulting first order partial differential equation to the total volumetric
  flow rate in the porous medium, one can introduce of a novel
  velocity that relates the two pairs of velocities. This velocity, the
  co-moving velocity, describes the mutual co-carrying of fluids due to
  immiscibility effects and interactions between the fluid clusters and the porous medium
  itself. The theory is based upon general principles of thermodynamics, and
  allows for many relations and analogies to draw upon for a two-phase flow systems. The goal of this work is
  to provide relations between geometric concepts and the
  variables appearing in the thermodynamics-like theory of two-phase flow. We encounter two interpretations of the velocities of the
  fluids: as tangent vectors (derivations) acting on functions, or as coordinates on
  an affine line. The two views are closely related, with the former viewpoint being
  more useful in relation to the underlying geometrical structure of equilibrium
  thermodynamics, and the latter being more useful in concrete computations and
  finding examples of constitutive relations. We apply these
  straightforward geometric contexts to interpret the relations
  between the velocities, and from this obtain a general form for the co-moving
  velocity.</description>

      <title>A simplified digital twin of a pressure swing adsorption plant for air separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process is one of the widely utilized techniques for air separation. Operating on the Skarstrom cycle, the porous adsorbent columns of a PSA system alternate between adsorption and desorption phases to selectively enrich the desired component in a gas mixture. The current work presents a robust and generalizable digital twin CFD model of a PSA system that can significantly help in design and device characterization. Using an axisymmetric representation, the digital twin accurately mimics all the key components of an air separation plant, including the air reservoir, adsorbent columns, product buffer tank, pressure regulator, solenoidal valves, and mesh filters. The model simulates the flow and adsorption processes in the system by solving the conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and species, along with the equation for adsorption kinetics. The cyclic operation of the PSA plants, typically controlled by solenoid valves, is emulated by dynamically modifying the boundary conditions of different subdomains. Such an integrated approach is shown here to closely replicate the performance of an in-house PSA pilot setup producing oxygen in terms of purity and pressure transience. Also, both the numerical and the experimental results yield an optimum performance for the same process parameters, such as pressurization time (26 s), purge time (2 s), and equalization time (4 s). The proposed numerical model is versatile and can be adapted to various industrial applications of PSA technology, such as hydrogen purification and carbon capture. Thus, it offers a cost-effective tool for designing and optimizing PSA systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent clogging of continuum particle suspensions in constricted channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle suspensions in confined geometries can become clogged, which can have a catastrophic effect on function in biological and industrial systems. Here, we investigate the macroscopic dynamics of suspensions in constricted geometries. We develop a minimal continuum two-phase model that allows for variation in particle volume fraction. The model comprises a ``wet solid'' phase with material properties dependent on the particle volume fraction, and a seepage Darcy flow of fluid through the particles. We find that spatially varying geometry (or material properties) can induce emergent heterogeneity in the particle fraction and trigger the abrupt transition to a high-particle-fraction ``clogged'' state.</description>

      <title>Kinetic study of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability: Multiscale thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects and their relative importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex dynamics of thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) and their relative importance during the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) using high-order discrete Boltzmann models (DBMs). First, the capabilities and differences among various discrete velocity sets in capturing TNEs and distribution functions are assessed. Based on this analysis, practical guidelines for constructing discrete velocity stencils are proposed to enhance phase-space discretization and improve the robustness of high-order DBMs. At different stages of KHI and under varying initial conditions, multiscale TNEs, such as viscous stresses of different orders, emerge with distinct dominant roles. Specifically, three scenarios are identified: (i) regimes dominated by first-order TNEs, (ii) alternation between first- and second-order TNEs, and (iii) states where second-order TNEs govern the system's behavior. To quantitatively capture these transitions, criteria for TNE dominance at different orders in KHI evolution are established based on the relative thermodynamic nonequilibrium intensity. In scenarios dominated by second-order TNEs, differences between first-order and second-order models are compared in terms of macroscopic quantities, nonequilibrium effects, and moment relations, revealing the physical limitations of low-order models in capturing TNEs. Furthermore, the effectiveness, extensibility, and limitations of a representative high-order model are examined under second-order TNE-dominated conditions. To encapsulate these findings, a nonequilibrium phase diagram that visually maps the multiscale characteristics of KHI is constructed. This diagram not only provides intuitive insights into the dynamic interplay of different nonequilibrium effects but also serves as a kinetic roadmap for selecting suitable models under diverse nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>A novel hybrid approach for accurate simulation of compressible multi-component flows across all-Mach number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of multi-component flow systems characterized by the simultaneous presence of pressure-velocity coupling and pressure-density coupling dominated regions remains a significant challenge in computational fluid dynamics. Thus, this work presents a novel approach that combines the Godunov-type scheme for high-speed flows with the projection solution procedure for incompressible flows to address this challenge. The proposed hybrid approach begins by splitting the inviscid flux into the advection part and the pressure part. The solution variables are first updated to their intermediate states by solving the advection part with the all-speed AUSM (Advection Upwind Splitting Method) Riemann solver. The advection flux in AUSM is modified to eliminate the pressure flux term that deteriorates the accuracy at the low Mach region. To prevent the advection flux from causing spurious velocities when surface tension is present, the pressure-velocity coupling term is modified to ensure it vanishes at material interfaces. Then, we derive the pressure Helmholtz equation to solve the final pressure and update the intermediate states to the solution variables at the next time step. The proposed hybrid approach retains the upwind property of the AUSM scheme for high Mach numbers while recovering central schemes and the standard projection solution for low Mach limits. To accurately resolve the complex flow structures including shock waves and material interfaces without numerical oscillations, a newly proposed homogenous ROUND (Reconstruction Operator on Unified Normalised-variable Diagram) reconstruction strategy is employed in this work. By simulating high-speed compressible multiphase flows and incompressible multiphase flows, this study demonstrates the ability of the proposed method to accurately handle flow regimes across all Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Energetically consistent localised APE budgets for local and regional studies of stratified flow energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because it allows a rigorous separation between reversible and irreversible processes, the concept of available potential energy (APE) has become central to the study of turbulent stratified fluids. In ocean modelling, it is fundamental to the parameterisation of meso-scale ocean eddies and of the turbulent mixing of heat and salt. However, how to apply APE theory consistently to local or regional subdomains has been a longstanding source of confusion due to the globally defined Lorenz reference state entering the definition of APE and of buoyancy forces being generally thought to be meaningless in those cases. In practice, this is often remedied by introducing heuristic `localised' forms of APE density depending uniquely on region-specific reference states, possibly diverging significantly from the global Lorenz reference state. In this paper, we argue that this practice is problematic because it cannot consistently describes the turbulent APE cascades associated with the inter-scale energy transfers between the APE produced at large scales -- which depends on the global Lorenz reference state -- and the APE of smaller scales. To avoid this difficulty, we argue that localised forms of APE density should be defined as the eddy APE component of an exact mean/eddy decomposition of the APE density. The eddy APE density thus defined exhibits a much weaker dependency on the global Lorenz reference state than the mean APE, in agreement with physical intuition, but with a different structure than that of existing heuristic localised APE forms. The results are important, because they establish a rigorous physical basis for linking parameterised energy transfers to observable viscous and diffusive dissipation rates, which is a pivotal goal of energetically consistent ocean models.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for solving moving interface flow problems using the level set approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advances the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) architectures to address moving interface problems via the level set method. Originally developed for other PDE-based problems, we particularly leverage PirateNet's features, including causal training, sequence-to-sequence learning, random weight factorization, and Fourier feature embeddings, and tailor them to achieve superior performance in modeling interface dynamics. Numerical experiments validate this framework on benchmark problems such as Zalesak's disk rotation and time-reversed vortex flow. We demonstrate that PINNs can efficiently solve level set problems exhibiting significant interface deformation without the need for upwind numerical stabilization, as generally required by classic discretization methods. Additionally, geometric reinitialization or mass conservation schemes have been revealed as unnecessary for accurate and efficient solutions. However, incorporating an Eikonal regularization term in the loss function with an appropriate weight can further enhance results in specific scenarios. Our results indicate that PINNs with the PirateNet architecture surpass conventional PINNs in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art error rates of $L^2=0.14\%$ for Zalesak's disk and $L^2=0.85 \%$ for the time-reversed vortex flow problem, as compared to reference solutions.</description>

      <title>5-wave interactions in inertia-gravity waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In oceans, multiple energetic inertia-gravity waves often coexist in a region. In this paper, we study the stability of two coexisting plane inertia-gravity waves (hereafter, primary waves), with the same frequencies ($\omega_1$) and wavevector norms, in a region of constant background stratification (denoted by $N$). Specifically, we explore the decay of two primary waves through triadic resonant instabilities (TRIs) in cases where the primary waves do not resonantly interact with each other. Two coexisting primary waves undergoing triadic resonant instability can force two secondary waves each, and this results in two 3-wave systems (3WS). In some cases, two primary waves can have a common secondary wave, and this results in a 5-wave system (5WS) composed of two different triads. We show that 5WSs are the dominant instabilities with higher growth rates than standard triads for a wide range of Coriolis frequency values ($f$). For 2D cases, 5WSs have higher growth rates than triads for $f/\omega_1\gtrapprox0.3$ and for primary waves with the same horizontal (vertical) wavenumber but with opposite vertical (horizontal) wavenumber. Similar results are observed for 3D cases where the primary waves are not on the same vertical plane. Numerical simulations match the theoretical growth rates of 5WSs for a wide range of latitudes, except when $f/\omega_1\approx0.5$ (critical latitude). Using theory and simulations, we show that the maximum growth rate near the critical latitude is approximately twice the maximum growth rate of all triads.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present article, series of opposed flow, downward flame spread experiments are conducted using 80 mm long cast PMMA cylinders of 1 mm and 0.5 mm diameters at normal and micro gravity environments. All the experiments are conducted at 21 % of oxygen by volume in nitrogen at 1 atmospheric pressure with varying the opposed flow speed from 0 cm/s to 25 cm/s. Flame spread rate, flame shape, preheating, and pyrolysis parameters are observed and analysed by tracking the leading edge of the flame by digital image processing, measuring flame field temperatures, schileren imaging and microscopic observation of burnt solid cones. It is concluded from the study that, flame spreads faster in microgravity for all diameters and opposed flows considered in the study, because of longer preheating length which is confirmed by temperature measurement using 50 microns thermocouples in a flame field. The thinner the fuel faster the flame spread rate because of curvature effect and reduced thermal inertia. In normal gravity, the flame spread rate reduces very slightly with increasing opposed flow while in micro</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the optimal hydrodynamic model for rarefied gas flows by combining the recent theory of slow spectral closure with machine learning techniques. We learn generalized transport coefficients from density fluctuation data and demonstrate that our approach decisively outperforms previously proposed constitutive laws for higher-order hydrodynamics. The novel hydrodynamic model is in extremely close alignment with the Shakhov kinetic model and DSMC data, thus proving the optimality of the slow spectral closure. Our theory is independent on any smallness assumption of the Knudsen number and is formulated solely in terms of macroscopic observables.</description>

Abstract: Rogue wave formation and enhancement over coastal areas have been documented over the last decade. However, this recent knowledge is in apparent contradiction with the established observation of sub-Gaussian wave statistics near shallow water. Current theories and experiments describe the rogue wave amplification near shallow water regimes, but only for small-amplitude waves, and thus, not accounting for wave-breaking processes. To address this gap, we perform experiments to probe inhomogeneous wave fields nearing the wave-breaking regime. We also show that by increasing the significant wave height towards the breaking limit, the kinetic energy grows faster than the variance of the surface elevation due to nonlinearity, providing a physical explanation why the occurrence of rogue wave first increases in shallower waters and suddenly decreases further shorewards.</description>

Abstract: The transition to chaos in the subcritical regime of counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow is investigated using a minimal periodic domain capable of sustaining coherent structures. Following a Feigenbaum cascade, the dynamics are found to be remarkably well approximated by a simple discrete map that admits rigorous proof of its chaotic nature. The chaotic set that arises for the map features densely distributed periodic points that are in one-to-one correspondence with unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the Navier-Stokes system. This supports the increasingly accepted view that UPOs may serve as the backbone of turbulence and, indeed, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct every statistical property of chaotic fluid flow from UPOs.</description>

      <title>A trade-off between hydrodynamic performance and morphological bias limits the evolution of symmetric lattice animal wings</title>

Abstract: Bristled and membranous insect wings have co-evolved despite apparently serving the same functionality. We emulate flight physics using an automated free-fall experiment to better understand how and why several distinct wing forms may have developed. Biomimetic two-dimensional lattice animals were laser cut from a continuous sheet of paper, and their descent in a settling tank was tracked using a camera. Data from 31 generic symmetric polyominos (1,692 experiments) reveal that morphology impacts the drag coefficient $C_D$ and hence flight efficiency. Some polyominos rapidly sediment while others remain suspended for longer. Positioning the search for an optimal shape within an evolutionary context, we relinquished control of the automated setup to a genetic algorithm. Hereditary information passes between generations in proportion to fitness and is augmented by rare mutations. High-performing morphologies are observed, but {experimental repeats do} not re-evolve the same shapes. Adaptation rates also differ if the selective pressure is reversed from suspension to sedimentation. Our data (50,086 experiments) reveal several physical sources of indeterminism in the simulated natural selection process, including fluid flow variability and morphological entropy. This provides experimental support for the idea that the lack of convergence in insect wing shape may partly reflect the competition between fitness and entropy, making it nearly impossible to achieve unique optimal forms.</description>
