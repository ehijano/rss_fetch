      <title>Producing and Studying Rare Isotopes in $e+A$ Collisions at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron--Ion Collider (EIC) offers a unique environment to study kinematically controlled lepton--nucleus (e+A) reactions, where a primary hard scattering is followed by an intranuclear cascade and the subsequent statistical de-excitation of the nuclear remnant. Utilizing the BeAGLE model, we demonstrate that event-by-event fluctuations in nucleon removal and energy deposition populate a diverse ensemble of excited remnants. Furthermore, we show that varying the target mass systematically shifts the distribution of these remnants across the (N, Z) plane. Although this excited prefragment remnant is not directly observable, its properties are shown to be strongly correlated with final-state fragments; specifically, the largest nuclear residue and the intensity of evaporation activity serve as effective experimental proxies for event-level remnant characterization. We also evaluate photon observables essential for nuclear spectroscopy. While various photon sources overlap significantly in pseudorapidity, we find that in the nucleus-rest frame, the low-energy spectrum is dominated by de-excitation $\gamma$ rays and exhibits distinct discrete structures. These findings motivate an EIC research program that correlates rare-isotope production and de-excitation radiation with well-defined initial conditions, providing a collider-based approach to nuclear spectroscopy that is complementary to existing fixed-target facilities.</description>

      <title>Light antiproton-nucleus systems at low energies with the ab initio NCSM/RGM method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of low-energy antiproton beams at the CERN Antiproton Decelerator has renewed interest in using antimatter as a probe of nuclear structure and in forming exotic antiprotonic few-body systems. In this work, we extend the ab initio No-Core Shell Model combined with the Resonating Group Method (NCSM/RGM), which was successfully applied to light-nucleus structure and reactions, to antiproton-nucleus dynamics at low energies. The NCSM/RGM formalism is adapted to antiproton projectiles by removing the requirement of antisymmetrization under exchange of target and projectile constituents, while retaining a fully microscopic description of the nuclear target and the relative motion. We focus on the lightest systems, ${\bar p}+d$, ${\bar p}+{}^3 \mathrm{H}$, and ${\bar p}+{}^3\mathrm{He}$, for which benchmarking against exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation enables stringent validation and helps disentangle methodological uncertainties -- e.g., those associated with the choice of configurations included in the NCSM/RGM expansion -- so that the dominant residual uncertainty can be attributed to the $N\bar{N}$ interaction. We compute phase shifts, scattering lengths, cross sections, antiprotonic-atom level shifts and widths, nuclear quasi-bound energies, and annihilation densities. We find that the hard short-range components of the meson-exchange-based $N\bar{N}$ interaction lead to slow convergence of the NCSM/RGM kernels expanded in a harmonic-oscillator basis, requiring exceptionally large model spaces and posing significant numerical challenges. We discuss practical strategies to mitigate these limitations and assess the impact of missing closed-channel configurations, which is a significant source of uncertainties in very light systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress and torsion distributions in the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress distributions in the deuteron are related to form factors of the asymmetric energy-momentum tensor through three-dimensional Fourier transforms. There are eleven such form factors, which we calculate in an impulse approximation. We compare the obtained form factors to prior results for the six form factors that have been previously calculated. We then elaborate on the formalism for relating the form factors to internal distributions of mass, mass flux, momentum, stresses, and forces, and obtain results for all of these distributions. We obtain the principal stresses for the symmetric part of the stress tensor, and show that the antisymmetric part describes reorientation of fermion spin by torsion stress when the nucleon moves between the S- and D-waves. Force distributions in the nucleons depend on the so-called non-conserved form factors through the Cauchy momentum equation, and are non-radial owing to the presence of tensor forces and spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction with terrestrial and astronomical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclear data and astronomical observations of neutron stars provide complementary constraints on the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction. In this work, we investigate the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction within a Skyrme energy density functional framework based on the KIDS (Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU) models. We employ a Skyrme-type $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction that includes the standard $s$- and $p$-wave terms, as well as a density-dependent term that effectively represents an $N\Lambda\Lambda$ three-body force. The $s$-wave terms are constrained using data on double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei supplemented by pseudodata obtained from core + $2\Lambda$ three-body model calculations including heavier hypernuclei. We show that the data on heavier systems are essential to simultaneously constrain the two $s$-wave parameters. We further explore the impact of the $p$-wave and $N\Lambda\Lambda$ components on the neutron-star properties and find that appropriate repulsive contributions of these terms yield consistency with current neutron-star mass-radius observations. These results indicate that the present framework provides phenomenologically acceptable equations of state for dense $(N,\Lambda)$ matter over a wide range of densities and highlight the importance of future experimental data on heavier double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Higher order quantization conditions for two-body scattering with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the L\"uscher quantization condition to high order for the scattering of a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle in a periodic box. First, we derive the quantization conditions in a non-relativistic framework up to total angular momentum $J=11/2$ in both cubic and elongated geometries, and for both rest and moving frames. Then, we introduce a method to transparently cross-check their convergence, using both quantized energy levels in the box and infinite-volume phase shifts for the same potential. We clarify how to incorporate spin-orbit coupling into the formalism and show in detail how the quantization conditions converge order by order in the various irreducible representations. In all, we validated 19 quantization conditions (12 in cubic box, 7 in elongated box). This is a necessary step in applying the method in precision studies of systems in finite volume with half-integer spin, such as meson-baryon scattering.</description>

      <title>Observation of Robust and Coherent Non-Abelian Hadron Dynamics on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time evolution of strongly interacting matter remains a frontier of fundamental physics, as classical simulations are hampered by exponential Hilbert space growth and entanglement-driven bottlenecks in tensor networks. This study reports the quantum simulation of hadron dynamics within a $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory using a 156-qubit IBM superconducting processor. Leveraging a hardware-efficient Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) encoding, we simulate the dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom on a $60$-site lattice in the weak-coupling regime, as a crucial step toward the continuum limit. We successfully observe the light-cone propagation of a confined meson and internal oscillations indicative of early-time hadronic breathing modes. Notably, these high-fidelity results were obtained directly from the quantum data via a differential measurement protocol, together with measurement error mitigation, demonstrating a robust pathway for large-scale simulations even on noisy hardware. To validate the results, we benchmarked the quantum algorithm and outcome from the quantum processor against state-of-the-art approximated classical algorithms using CPU -- based on tensor network methods and Pauli propagation method, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative comparison demonstrating that as the system approaches the weak-coupling or the continuum limit, the quantum processor maintains a consistent structural robustness where classical tensor networks and Pauli propagation methods encounter an onset of exponential complexity or symmetry violations as an artifact of approximation in the algorithm. These results establish a scalable pathway for simulating non-Abelian dynamics on near-term quantum hardware and mark a critical step toward achieving a practical quantum advantage in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine interaction as a probe of the microscopic structure of the atomic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of highly charged electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, provides an intriguing way to probe the internal structure of their atomic nuclei. In this work, we use nuclear structure calculations to accurately calculate the hyperfine splitting of electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, focusing in particular on the incorporation of finite-volume corrections, such as Bohr-Weisskopf and Breit-Rosenthal, due to the penetration of the electron and muon wavefunction into the nuclear electric charge and magnetic dipole densities. These corrections are essential for refining our understanding of the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Our simulations use a Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS model known for its effectiveness in modeling well-deformed nuclei such as ${}^{159}\mathrm{Tb}^{64+}$ and ${}^{165}\mathrm{Ho}^{66+}$, with particular emphasis on ${}^{161,163}\mathrm{Dy}^{65+}$ isotopes. It can also be generalised to multi-electron ions by studying the hyperfine anomaly between two isotopes.</description>

      <title>Quark-meson diquark model and color superconductivity in dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two- and three-flavor QMD models as renormalizable low-energy models for QCD at finite quark chemical potentials with quarks, mesons, and diquarks as effective degrees of freedom. Using the on-shell scheme the parameters in the scalar sector can be fixed and expressed in terms of observed meson masses and decay constants. The remaining parameters can be varied. In the QMD models, all the symmetries are global, including the $SU(N_c)$ symmetry. The breaking of the global symmetries gives rise to a number of Goldstone bosons depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern, i.e. whether the system is in the 2SC phase or the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase. This is in contrast to perturbative QCD, where some of the gauge bosons become massive via the Higgs mechanism. We classify the Goldstone bosons and show that their type and number are in accordance with general counting rules. The thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ is calculated in the mean-field approximation, where we include quark loops, while mesons and diquarks are treated at tree level. As important applications, we study the properties of the pion-condensed phase at finite isospin chemical potential, and the 2SC and CFL phases at finite baryon chemical potential. We present a few numerical results focusing on the speed of sound, gaps, and condensates. It is shown that the BCS gaps approaches a constant for large isospin and baryon chemical potentials and that the speed of sound approaches the conformal value from above in the same limit.</description>

Abstract: Scalar field theory is studied by constructing interacting saddle point expansions in the symmetric and broken phase, respectively. Focusing on analytically tractable saddle expansions, it is found that broken and symmetric phases are related by sign flip of the quartic coupling. Applications to dimensions $d&lt;4$ recover previous results for the phase diagram, whereas $d=4$ is possibly new.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group to link different scales. We uncover a novel transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological refinement of $p$-$d$ elastic scattering descriptions towards the 3NF study in nuclei via the ($p,pd$) reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ($p,pd$) reaction is expected to be a powerful tool for probing three-nucleon forces (3NFs) in nuclear medium since it can be essentially regarded as the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering inside nuclei. One of the important points in the theoretical description of the ($p,pd$) reaction is to calculate the $p$-$d$ scattering in a nucleus quantitatively using effective interactions. This work aims to develop a phenomenological approach to improve the quantitativity of the $p$-$d$ scattering cross section in free space calculated with effective interactions. The $p$-$d$ elastic amplitude is decomposed into a 2N part, described using 2N effective interactions, and a residual part, which the 2N part cannot describe. The latter is approximated by a superposition of Legendre polynomials, with coefficients treated as adjustable parameters. These parameters are determined to reproduce experimental $p$-$d$ differential cross-section data at various incident energies. The obtained parameters exhibit smooth energy dependence, which is approximated by quadratic functions. The numerical results with the analytic energy dependence also reproduce the experimental data. The developed approach works well for improving the $p$-$d$ scattering cross section in a wide range of incident energies. This work can be regarded as the first step toward the description of ($p,pd$) reactions taking 3NF effect in nuclear medium into account.</description>

      <title>Bayesian approach for many-body uncertainties in nuclear structure: Many-body perturbation theory for finite nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive assessment of theoretical uncertainties defines an important frontier in nuclear structure research. Ideally, theory predictions include uncertainty estimates that take into account truncation effects from both the interactions and the many-body expansion. While the uncertainties from the expansion of the interactions within effective field theories have been studied systematically using Bayesian methods, many-body truncations are usually addressed by expert assessment. In this work we use a Bayesian framework to study many-body uncertainties within many-body perturbation theory applied to finite nuclei. Our framework is applied to a broad range of nuclei across the nuclear chart calculated from two- and three-nucleon interactions based on chiral effective field theory. These developments represent a step towards a more complete and systematic quantification of uncertainties in \emph{ab initio} calculations of nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effects of symmetry restoration on nuclear beta decay within the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). We employ the proton-neutron finite-amplitude method (pnFAM) to compute transition amplitudes, and perform angular-momentum projection both after variation and after the QRPA to restore rotational symmetry. Exact projection reduces the calculated beta decay half-lives from those that use the needle approximation by up to 60%, and even more when taking the effects of projection on the ground-state energy into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest to understand multi-neutron systems has a long history, and recent experimental efforts aim to probe candidate four-neutron configurations in neutron-rich light nuclei such as ${}^8$He and ${}^7$H via quasi-free knockout reactions. However, the ground-state energies of the hydrogen isotopes ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H are not yet well constrained, with substantial discrepancies across experimental analyses and theoretical predictions. Using ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory with an ensemble of 282 chiral two- and three-nucleon forces, we perform a Bayesian uncertainty-quantified analysis of the ground-state energies of ${}^6$H and ${}^7$H. The marginal posteriors suggest single-neutron separation energy $S_n({}^{7}\mathrm{H})=0.35^{+0.32}_{-0.32}$ MeV, which kinematically disfavors sequential decay via ${}^{6}\mathrm{H}+n$ and thereby makes multi-neutron emission channels comparatively more relevant. Intrinsic densities indicate triton- and $\alpha$-like clusters in ${}^7$H and ${}^8$He, respectively. By computing two-body and reduced four-body correlation functions, we find that the valence neutrons in the surface region of these systems form compact dineutrons that predominantly organize into approximately symmetric dineutron-dineutron configurations, with only a small but non-negligible fraction assembling into more compact tetraneutron-like substructures. In ${}^7$H, these components account for roughly 95\% and 5\% of the sampled four-neutron configurations, respectively, and ${}^8$He exhibits a similar hierarchy. For these configurations, we also extract the corresponding spatial and angular correlation patterns among the nucleons. These results provide nuclear-structure insights into the debate surrounding four-neutron clusters and complement ongoing experimental searches for tetraneutron signatures in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>$r$-process Heating Feedback on Disk Outflows from Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers produce $r$-process elements, with yields that are sensitive to the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the ejecta. These ejecta properties are potentially affected by dynamically-important feedback from $r$-process heating, which is usually not coupled to the hydrodynamics in post-merger simulations modeling the ejecta launching and expansion. The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed the importance of producing reliable ejecta predictions, to maximize the diagnostic potential of future events. In this paper, we develop a prescription for including $r$-process heating as a source term in the hydrodynamic equations. This prescription depends on local fluid properties and on the $Y_{e}$ history as recorded by dedicated tracer particles, which exchange information with the grid using the Cloud-in-Cell method. The method is implemented in long-term viscous hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disk outflows to investigate its feedback on ejecta properties. We find that $r$-process heating can increase the unbound disk ejecta mass by $\sim 10\%$ relative to a baseline case that only considers alpha particle recombination. Nuclear heating also enhances the radial velocity of the ejecta with $Y_e &lt; 0.25$ by up to a factor of two, while concurrently suppressing marginally-bound convective ejecta.</description>

      <title>Stochastic analysis of ultra-high energy cosmic ray interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonuclear interactions between ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) nuclei and surrounding photon fields are key to understanding the connection between the compositions observed at Earth and those emitted from the sources. These interactions can completely disintegrate a nucleus of iron over trajectory lengths of a few and up to hundreds of megaparsecs, depending on the energy of the UHECR. The stochastic nature of these interactions means that it is not possible to describe them deterministically for a single cosmic ray, and an exact formulation of the probability distributions is not yet available. Current approaches describe these interactions using either Monte Carlo simulations or solving ordinary differential equations that neglect stochasticity. Because of the limitations of these approaches, only partial capture of the process is achieved. This paper presents an analytic probabilistic description of UHECR interactions and the resulting nuclear cascades, establishing their connection to Markov jump processes. The fundamental properties of these cascades are presented, as is the computation of the usual quantities of interest, such as the horizon, spectrum, and composition. The benefits of this description are outlined using astrophysical examples related to extragalactic propagation and UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>Light-Front Transverse Nucleon Charge and Magnetisation Densities</title>

Abstract: Nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors obtained using both the three-body and quark + fully-interacting-diquark pictures of nucleon structure are employed to calculate an array of light-front transverse densities for the proton and neutron and their dressed valence-quark constituents, viz. flavour separations of the proton and neutron results. These two complementary descriptions of nucleon structure deliver mutually compatible predictions, which match expectations based on modern parametrisations of available data, where such are available. Amongst other things, it is found that transverse-plane valence $u$- and $d$-quark Dirac radii are practically indistinguishable; but regarding kindred Pauli radii, the $d$ quark value is roughly 10% greater than that of the $u$-quark. Moreover, magnetically, the valence $d$ quark is far more active than the valence $u$ quark, probably because it has much greater orbital angular momentum. Both pictures of nucleon structure agree in predicting that, in a polarised nucleon, the transverse-plane charge densities are no longer rotationally invariant. Instead, for a $+\hat x$ polarised nucleon, positive charge is displaced in the $+\hat y$ direction, with the opposite effect for negative charge.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>
