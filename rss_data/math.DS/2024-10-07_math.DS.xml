      <title>Completely Li--Yorke chaotic homeomorphisms with positive entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an open problem whether a homeomorphism on a compact metric space satisfying that each proper pair is either positively or negatively Li--Yorke, called completely Li--Yorke chaotic, can have positive entropy. In the present paper, an affirmative answer to this question is given. In fact, for each homeomorphism $T$ with positive entropy such that each proper pair is not two-sided asymptotic, a completely Li--Yorke chaotic homeomorphism with positive entropy associated with the given homeomorphism can be constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Ma\~n\'e-Sad-Sullivan and Lyubich's equivalent characterization of stability to the setting of Ahlfors island maps, which include notably all meromorphic maps. As a consequence we also obtain the density of $J$-stability for finite type maps in the sense of Epstein.</description>

      <title>Morse Index for Homothetic motions in the gravitational n-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the gravitation n-body Problem, a homothetic orbit is a special solution of the Newton's Equations of motion, in which each body moves along a straight line through the center of mass and forming at any time a central configuration. In 2020, Portaluri et al. proved that under a spectral gap condition on the limiting central configuration, known in literature as non-spiraling or [BS]-condition, the Morse index of an asymptotic colliding motion is finite. Later Ou et al. proved this result for other classes of unbounded motions, e.g. doubly asymptotic motions (e.g. doubly homothetic motions).
  In this paper we prove that for a homothetic motion, irrespective of how large the index of the limiting central configuration and how large the energy level is, the following alternative holds: if the non-spiraling condition holds then the Morse index is 0 otherwise it is infinite.</description>

      <title>Identification des param\`etres d'un mod\`ele logistique en dynamique des populations avec sortie affine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parameters identification of a dynamic model of a population living in a given host environment governed by a logistic law. We use a statistic Kullback-Leibler type method to derive the algorithm for estimating the parameters of the model in two levels. The first level AIG is an offline algorithm and global it is obtained using the critical points of the reestimation transformation between two parameters. It estimates the parameters in a global iterative manner starting from a block of data. The second level ARE is adaptive recursive and is used online. It constitutes a refinement of the AIG algorithm. The convergence of the AIG algorithm is an open problem. The convergence of the ARE algorithm is demonstrated by constructing a new model, a new space and a new probability law.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Unpredictable Solutions of Quasilinear Impulsive Systems with Regular Discontinuity Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of asymptotic unpredictability was recently introduced in (Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simul. 134, 108029, 2024) for semiflows. Likewise unpredictable trajectories, asymptotically unpredictable ones are also capable of producing sensitivity in a dynamics, which is an indispensable feature of chaos. In the present study, we newly propose piecewise continuous asymptotically unpredictable functions, and investigate the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in a quasilinear impulsive system of differential equations comprising a term which is periodic in the time argument. The class of functions and the impulsive system under discussion admit regular discontinuity moments. Some techniques for obtaining discontinuous asymptotically unpredictable functions are additionally provided. Even though piecewise continuous unpredictable functions are asymptotically unpredictable, it is demonstrated that the converse is not true. In other words, the set of discontinuous unpredictable functions is properly contained in the set of asymptotically unpredictable ones. Appropriate examples are given with regard to all theoretical results.</description>

      <title>An extension of the Wiener-Wintner ergodic theorem for pointwise jointly ergodic systems and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A joint measure-preserving system is $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu_{1}, \dots, \mu_{k}, T_{1}, \dots, T_{k})$, where each $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu_{i}, T_{i})$ is a measure-preserving system and any $\mu_{i}$ and $\mu_{j}$ are mutually absolutely continuous probability measures. Such a system is called pointwise jointly ergodic if, for any set of bounded measurable functions $f_{1}, \dots, f_{k}$ on $X$, the multilinear ergodic average of their joint action under the transformations $T_{1}, \dots, T_{k}$ converges almost everywhere to the product of their integrals with respect to the corresponding measures.
  In this paper, we extend the classical Wiener-Wintner ergodic theorem to the setting of pointwise jointly ergodic systems with nilsequences weight. Additionally, we provide applications that include results on the mean convergence of weighted ergodic averages and the almost everywhere convergence of ergodic averages taken along subsequences of the form $\lfloor \alpha n \rfloor$, where $\alpha \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Basins of Equilibria and geometry of Global Sectors in Holomorphic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper to [Local geometry of Equilibria and a Poincare-Bendixson-type Theorem for Holomorphic Flows, Nicolas Kainz, Dirk Lebiedz (2004)] we investigate the global topology and geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x} = F(x)$ with entire vector field $F$ by exploiting and extending the local structure of finite elliptic decompositions. We prove topological properties of the basins of centers, nodes, and foci, while excluding isolated equilibria at the boundaries of the latter two. We propose a definition of global elliptic sectors and introduce the notion of a sector-forming orbit allowing global topological analysis. The structure of heteroclinic regions between two equilibria is characterized.</description>

      <title>Scalar polynomial vector fields in real and complex time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, the simplest scalar ODE case is studied for polynomials $$ \dot{w}=f(w)=(w-e_0)\cdot\ldots\cdot(w-e_{d-1}) $$ of degree $d$ with $d$ simple complex zeros. The explicit solution by separation of variables and explicit integration is an almost trivial matter.
  In a classical spirit, indeed, we describe the complex Riemann surface $\mathcal{R}$ of the global nontrivial solution $(t,w(t))$ in complex time, as an unbranched cover of the punctured Riemann sphere. The flow property, however, fails at $w=\infty$. The global consequences depend on the period map of the residues $2\pi\mathrm{i}/f'(e_j)$ of $1/f$ at the punctures, in detail. We therefore show that polynomials $f$ exist for arbitrarily prescribed residues with zero sum. This result is not covered by standard interpolation theory.
  Motivated by the PDE case, we also classify the planar real-time phase portraits of the above ODE.
  Poincar\'e compactification of $w$ regularizes $w=\infty$ by $2(d-1)$ equilibria, alternatingly stable and unstable within the invariant circle boundary at infinity. In structurally stable cases, we classify all compactified phase portraits, up to orientation preserving orbit equivalence and time reversal. Combinatorially, their connection graphs are equivalent to certain unrooted, unlabeled, undirected planar trees of $d$ vertices or, dually, to certain chord diagrams with $d-1$ nonintersecting chords. It remains a conjecture, at present, that all planar trees actually arise from Poincar\'e compactifications.
  Not least, we offer a 1,000 Euro reward for the discovery, or refutation, of complex entire homoclinic orbits.</description>

      <title>On the Variation of the Milnor Number of Foliations under Blow-ups of Non-Isolated Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a one-dimensional holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^n$ such that $\mathbf{W} \subset \text{Sing}(\mathcal{F})$, where $\mathbf{W}$ is a smooth complete intersection variety. We determine and compute the variation of the Milnor number $\mu(\mathcal{F}, \mathbf{W})$ under blowups, which depends on the vanishing order of the pullback foliation along the exceptional divisor, as well as on numerical and topological invariants of $\mathbf{W}$. This represents a higher-dimensional version of Van den Essen's formula for projective foliations. As an application, in $\mathbb{P}^3$, we provide a Seidenberg-type theorem for non-isolated singularities, without assuming that they are absolutely isolated. That is, the foliation has a birational model on a smooth manifold which is generically log canonical.</description>

      <title>Shock selection in reaction--diffusion equations with partially negative diffusivity using nonlinear regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general reaction--nonlinear-diffusion equation with a region of negative diffusivity, and show how a nonlinear regularisation selects a shock position. Negative diffusivity can model population aggregation, but leads to shock-fronted solutions for population density. In general the shock position is non-unique. Previous studies have defined shock selection criteria such as the equal area rule, and shown how these arise from specific regularisations to the reaction--diffusion equation. In this work, we show that a nonlinear regularisation leads to travelling wave solutions where the shock is selected according to a modified equal area rule. Adjusting the nonlinearity in the regularisation moves the shock location. We focus on attaining shocks that conserve diffusivity across the shock, and demonstrate that this condition yields the longest possible shock length. Using geometric singular perturbation theory, we prove the existence of shock-fronted travelling wave solutions with continuous diffusivity, show how to construct them, and demonstrate that they correspond to a unique wave speed. Numerical solutions align with theoretical predictions for shock position and wave speed, confirming that a single regularisation term can vary the shock position and attain shocks with continuous diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Parametric Taylor series based latent dynamics identification neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solving parameterised partial differential equations (P-PDEs) is highly practical yet computationally expensive, driving the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Recently, methods that combine latent space identification techniques with deep learning algorithms (e.g., autoencoders) have shown great potential in describing the dynamical system in the lower dimensional latent space, for example, LaSDI, gLaSDI and GPLaSDI.
  In this paper, a new parametric latent identification of nonlinear dynamics neural networks, P-TLDINets, is introduced, which relies on a novel neural network structure based on Taylor series expansion and ResNets to learn the ODEs that govern the reduced space dynamics. During the training process, Taylor series-based Latent Dynamic Neural Networks (TLDNets) and identified equations are trained simultaneously to generate a smoother latent space. In order to facilitate the parameterised study, a $k$-nearest neighbours (KNN) method based on an inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation scheme is introduced to predict the identified ODE coefficients using local information. Compared to other latent dynamics identification methods based on autoencoders, P-TLDINets remain the interpretability of the model. Additionally, it circumvents the building of explicit autoencoders, avoids dependency on specific grids, and features a more lightweight structure, which is easy to train with high generalisation capability and accuracy. Also, it is capable of using different scales of meshes. P-TLDINets improve training speeds nearly hundred times compared to GPLaSDI and gLaSDI, maintaining an $L_2$ error below $2\%$ compared to high-fidelity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating a priori physics knowledge into machine learning leads to more robust and interpretable algorithms. In this work, we combine deep learning techniques and classic numerical methods for differential equations to solve two challenging problems in dynamical systems theory: dynamics discovery and parameter estimation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches on a suite of test problems exhibiting oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. When comparing the performance of various numerical schemes, such as the Runge-Kutta and linear multistep families of methods, we observe promising results in predicting the system dynamics and estimating physical parameters, given appropriate choices of spatial and temporal discretization schemes and numerical method orders.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Volumes, Lorenz-like templates, and braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorenz-like templates are obtained from applying half twists to the two strips of the Lorenz template. Ghrist proved that infinitely many of these templates are universal, meaning they contain all links in the 3-sphere. In this paper, we generalise the bunch algorithm to construct links embedded in universal Lorenz-like templates and provide an upper volume bound that is quadratic in the trip number. We also establish a correspondence between links embedded in these universal Lorenz-like templates and generalised T-links. While generalised T-links have appeared in the knot theory literature before, we prove that they are, in fact, all links in the 3-sphere. Thus, we can regard each link in the 3-sphere as a generalised T-link, which has an associated Lorenz link. We use the upper bound obtained from the generalised bunch algorithm to provide an upper volume bound for all hyperbolic link complements in the 3-sphere. Such a bound grows quadratically in terms of the braid indexes of the associated Lorenz links.</description>

Abstract: Power series with rational functions as coefficients are ubiquitous in mathematics, particularly so in number theory and mathematical physics. In this paper we introduce a class of such series that we call meandromorphic. Under appropriate Diophantine conditions this class is quasi-analytic i.e. elements are uniquely defined by their Taylor series at any point of a so-called residual set. Our theorems also explain geometrically the divergence of the Taylor series by the presence of accumulation points for the poles.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Hierarchical Dynamical Systems Models from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In science, we are often interested in obtaining a generative model of the underlying system dynamics from observed time series. While powerful methods for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single domain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage it for generalization is still an open question. This becomes particularly important when individual time series are short, and group-level information may help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. At the same time, averaging is not an option in DSR, as it will wipe out crucial dynamical properties (e.g., limit cycles in one domain vs. chaos in another). Hence, a framework is needed that enables to efficiently harvest group-level (multi-domain) information while retaining all single-domain dynamical characteristics. Here we provide such a hierarchical approach and showcase it on popular DSR benchmarks, as well as on neuroscientific and medical time series. In addition to faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our unsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in which datasets with similar dynamics cluster. The features spanning these spaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often linear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the underlying system. Finally, we illustrate transfer learning and generalization to new parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Extensions of $\mathcal{KL}$ and Lyapunov Functions for Discrete-time Dynamical System Peaks Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend two classes of functions classically involved in asymptotic stability analyses for studying a maximization problem on the reachable values of a discrete-time dynamical system. This maximization problem is called a peaks computation problem. The problem is to find a couple composed of an initial state and a time which maximizes a given function over states. The paper focuses on the time component of the optimal solution which is an integer as the time is discrete. We develop a method to provide an upper bound of this integer from a formula which requires a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). A first result proves that the formula provides, in theory, the optimal integer. However, in practice, the computation cannot be so precise. Then, we develop two alternative methods. The first is based on discontinuous and non strictly increasing/decreasing $\mathcal{KL}$-like functions named $\klgen$ functions. We prove that the existence of a $mathcal{KL}_{\rm gen}$ upper bound is equivalent to the existence of a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). The construction of the strictly increasing continuous function from a $mathcal{KL}_{\rm gen}$ function needs an extension of the famous Sontag's lemma. Finally, we construct a new type of Lyapunov functions, called Opt-Lyapunov functions, well designed for our peaks computation problem. Opt-Lyapunov functions are well designed as we establish an equivalence theorem between the existence of an Opt-Lyapunov function and of a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on $[0,1]$ and a scalar in (0,1). The construction of a Opt-Lyapunov function from a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a convergent geometric sequence is insipred by the Yoshizawa construction of Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>K-Independent Boolean Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new parameter for studying Boolean networks: the independence number. We establish that a Boolean network is $k$-independent if, for any set of $k$ variables and any combination of binary values assigned to them, there exists at least one fixed point in the network that takes those values at the given set of $k$ indices. In this context, we define the independence number of a network as the maximum value of $k$ such that the network is $k$-independent. This definition is closely related to widely studied combinatorial designs, such as "$k$-strength covering arrays", also known as Boolean sets with all $k$-projections surjective. Our motivation arises from understanding the relationship between a network's interaction graph and its fixed points, which deepens the classical paradigm of research in this direction by incorporating a particular structure on the set of fixed points, beyond merely observing their quantity. Specifically, among the results of this paper, we highlight a condition on the in-degree of the interaction graph for a network to be $k$-independent, we show that all regulatory networks are at most $n/2$-independent, and we construct $k$-independent networks for all possible $k$ in the case of monotone networks with a complete interaction graph.</description>

      <title>Closed Form Solution for Parabolic Flow of a Inclined Isothermal Plate With Uniform Mass Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluid flow across an unbounded horizontal plate embedded with uniform mass diffusion is studied in this article together with the impacts of the chemical reaction and parabolic motion, while the temperature and concentration of the plate remain constant. Using initial and boundary conditions, partial differential equations were used to describe this phenomenon. Introduce some appropriate non-dimensional variables and utilize the Laplace transform method to solve the corresponding dimensionless equations. The following analytical remedies for heat, velocity and concentration profiles were produced in terms of exponential and (erfc) complementary error functions. A MATLAB programme is used to exhibit the results as graphs for various parameters. By creating graphs, we may assess the characteristics of the velocity, Heat and concentration while also studying the physical aspects for various factors.</description>

      <title>An embedding theorem for multidimensional subshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krieger's embedding theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift to embed in a given topologically mixing $\mathbb{Z}$-subshift of finite type. For some $\mathbb{Z}^d$-subshifts of finite type, Lightwood characterized the \emph{aperiodic} subsystems. In the current paper we prove a new embedding theorem for a class of subshifts of finite type over any countable abelian group. Our main theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary subshift $X$ to embed inside a given subshift of finite type $Y$ that satisfies a certain condition. For the particular case of $\mathbb{Z}$-subshifts, our new theorem coincides with Krieger's theorem. In particular, our result gives the first complete characterization of the subsystems of the multidimensional full shift $Y= A^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$. The natural condition on the target subshift $Y$, introduced explicitly for the first time in the current paper, is called the map extension property. It was introduced implicitly by Mike Boyle in the early 1980's for $\mathbb{Z}$-subshifts, and is closely related to the notion of an absolute retract, introduced by Borsuk in the 1930's. A $\mathbb{Z}$-subshift has the map extension property if and only if it is a topologically mixing subshift of finite type. Over abelian groups, a subshift has the map extension property if and only if it is a contractible SFT as shown in work of Poirier and Salo. We also establish a new theorem regarding lower entropy factors of multidimensional subshifts, that extends Boyle's lower entropy factor theorem from the one-dimensional case.</description>

Abstract: We investigate unipotent dynamics on a torus and apply these techniques to the following problem. Let \(d\) be a positive integer, and let \(a &gt; 0\) be a real number. For an integer \(b \geqslant 5\), such that \(a\) and \(b\) are multiplicatively independent, consider the sequence \((\mathbf{w}_n)\), where \(\mathbf{w}_n\) is the most significant digit of \(a^{n^d}\) when expressed in base \(b\). We prove that the complexity function of the sequence \((\mathbf{w}_n)\) is, up to finitely many exceptions, a polynomial function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two infinite-dimensional KAM theorems with frequency-preserving for a nonresonant frequency of Diophantine type or even weaker. To be more precise, under a nondegenerate condition for an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, we prove the persistence of a full-dimensional KAM torus with the specified frequency independent of any spectral asymptotics, by advantage of the generating function method. This appears to be the first Kolmogorov type result in the infinite-dimensional context. As a direct application, we provide a positive answer to Bourgain's conjecture: full-dimensional invariant tori for 1D nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations do exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework holds promise for spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems based on linear operators. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, so-called Koopman eigenvalues and Koopman eigenfunctions, respectively, mirror global properties of the system's flow. In this paper we perform the Koopman analysis of the singularly-perturbed van der Pol system. First, we show the spectral signature depending on singular perturbation: how two Koopman {principal} eigenvalues are ordered and what distinct shapes emerge in their associated Koopman eigenfunctions. Second, we discuss the singular limit of the Koopman operator, which is derived through the concatenation of Koopman operators for the fast and slow subsystems. From the spectral properties of the Koopman operator for the {singularly}-perturbed system and the singular limit, we suggest that the Koopman eigenfunctions inherit geometric properties of the singularly-perturbed system. These results are applicable to general planar singularly-perturbed systems with stable limit cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete-time deterministic dynamical system is governed at every step by a predetermined law. However the dynamics can lead to many complexities in the phase space and in the domain of observables that makes it comparable to a stochastic process. This behavior can be characterized by properties such as mixing and ergodicity. This article presents two different approximations of a dynamical system, that approximates the ergodicity of the dynamics in different manner. The first is a step-skew product system, in which a finite state Markov process drives a dynamics on Euclidean space. The second is a continuous-time skew-product system, in which a deterministic, mixing flow intermittently drives a deterministic flow through a topological space created by gluing cylinders. This system is called a perturbed pipe-flow. We show how these three representations are interchangeable. The inter-connections also reveal how a deterministic chaotic system partitions the phase space at a local level, and also mixes the phase space at a global level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

Abstract: We consider irreversible and coupled reversible-irreversible nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems and the respective sets of thermodynamic equilibria. In particular, we are concerned with optimal state transitions and output stabilization on finite-time horizons. We analyze a class of optimal control problems, where the performance functional can be interpreted as a linear combination of energy supply, entropy generation, or exergy supply. Our results establish the integral turnpike property towards the set of thermodynamic equilibria providing a rigorous connection of optimal system trajectories to optimal steady states. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our findings by means of two examples: a network of heat exchangers and a gas-piston system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of Hermitian Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to the spectral properties of self-adjoint Koopman operators. Hermitian DMD is a data-driven method that approximates the Koopman operator associated with an unknown nonlinear dynamical system, using discrete-time snapshots. This approach preserves the self-adjointness of the operator in its finite-dimensional approximations. \rev{We prove that, under suitably broad conditions, the spectral measures corresponding to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions computed by Hermitian DMD converge to those of the underlying Koopman operator}. This result also applies to skew-Hermitian systems (after multiplication by $i$), applicable to generators of continuous-time measure-preserving systems. Along the way, we establish a general theorem on the convergence of spectral measures for finite sections of self-adjoint operators, including those that are unbounded, which is of independent interest to the wider spectral community. We numerically demonstrate our results by applying them to two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic models describe phenomena across scientific disciplines, yet to make these models useful in application the unknown parameter values of the models must be determined. Discrete-time dynamic models are widely used to model biological processes, but it is often difficult to determine these parameters. In this paper, we propose a symbolic-numeric approach for parameter estimation in discrete-time models that involve univariate non-algebraic (locally) analytic functions such as exp. We illustrate the performance (precision) of our approach by applying our approach to two archetypal discrete-time models in biology (the flour beetle 'LPA' model and discrete Lotka-Volterra competition model). Unlike optimization-based methods, our algorithm guarantees to find all solutions of the parameter values up to a specified precision given time-series data for the measured variables provided that there are finitely many parameter values that fit the data and that the used polynomial system solver can find all roots of the associated polynomial system with interval coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new controllability property for linear time varying control systems in finite dimension: the nonuniform complete controllability, which is halfway between the classical Kalman's properties of complete controllability and uniform complete controllability. This new concept is described in terms of two gramian inequalities, which have a strong relation; as we prove in our first result; with the property of nonuniform bounded growth for the corresponding plant, also called uncontrolled part. On the other hand, the second result proves that if a control system is nonuniformly completely controllable and its plant has the property of nonuniform bounded growth, then there exist a linear feedback control leading to a nonuniformly exponentially stable closed--loop system.</description>

      <title>Space-time deterministic graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-terminating graph rewriting models, whose local rules are applied non-deterministically -- and yet enjoy a strong form of determinism, namely space-time determinism. Of course in the case of terminating computation it is well-known that the mess introduced by asynchronous rule applications may not matter to the end result, as confluence conspires to produce a unique normal form. In the context of non-terminating computation however, confluence is a very weak property, and (almost) synchronous rule applications is always preferred e.g. when it comes to simulating dynamical systems. Here we provide sufficient conditions so that asynchronous local rule applications conspire to produce well-determined events in the space-time unfolding of the graph, regardless of their application orders. Our first example is an asynchronous simulation of a dynamical system. Our second example features time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Inference for the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model from real action potential data via approximate Bayesian computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model is a two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equation with additive degenerate noise, whose first component, the only one observed, describes the membrane voltage evolution of a single neuron. Due to its low-dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process, "recovering" the unobserved second component) and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. The proposed method tackles all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise and partial observations). It is an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm, which relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. All model parameters are successfully estimated from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.</description>

      <title>Efficient, Multimodal, and Derivative-Free Bayesian Inference With Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible.
  While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii).
  The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <title>On the number of quadratic polynomials with a given portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a number field. Given a quadratic polynomial $f_c(z) = z^2 + c \in F[z]$, we can construct a directed graph $Preper(f_c, F)$ (also called a portrait), whose vertices are $F$-rational preperiodic points for $f_c$, with an edge $\alpha \to \beta$ if and only if $f_c(\alpha) = \beta$. Poonen and Faber classified the portraits that occur for infinitely many $c$'s.
  Given a portrait $P$, we prove an asymptotic formula for counting the number of $c \in F$'s by height, such that $Preper(f_c, F) \cong P$. We also prove an asymptotic formula for the analogous counting problem, where $Preper(f_c, K) \cong P$ for some quadratic extension $K/F$. These results are conditioned on Morton-Silverman conjecture.</description>
