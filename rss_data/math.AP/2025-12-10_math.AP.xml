      <title>On the discrete to continuous condensing aggregation equation: A weak convergence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the passage of limits from discrete to continuous condensing aggregation equation which comprises of Oort-Hulst-Safronov (OHS) equation together with inverse aggregation process. We establish the relation between discrete and continuous condensing aggregation equations in its most generalized form, where kinetic-kernels with respect to OHS and inverse aggregation equations are not always equal. Convergence criterion is proved under suitable a priori estimates by approximating the continuous equation through a sequence of discrete equations, which subsequently converges towards the solution of the continuous equation by weak compactness principles. Existence of solution to the discrete model and uniform bounds on different order moments over finite time under particular conditions on kinetic-kernels are investigated. We analyze long-time dynamics and blowup of the solution leading to mass-loss or gelation for specific kernels. Three numerical experiments show the accuracy and convergence of approximated solutions to the exact solution of the continuous equation when $\varepsilon$ approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Inverse coefficient problem for a fully fractional diffusion equation with nonlinear and source nonlocal initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider an inverse problem of determining a time dependent coefficient in a fully fractional diffusion equation with a nonlinear source term. The nonlocal initial-boundary value problem refers to the forward model: the fractional diffusion equation equipped with a nonlocal initial condition and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution to this nonlocal initial boundary value problem, together with the corresponding regularity properties of the solution. These results are obtained via the Fourier method, tools from fractional calculus, and key properties of the Mittag-Leffler function.
  Subsequently, by applying a fixed-point argument in suitable Sobolev spaces, we prove a theorem on the local existence and uniqueness of the solution to the inverse problem. In this way, we establish the well-posedness of the problem solution.</description>

      <title>On Schauder Estimates for Fractional Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Schauder estimates $\unicode{x2013}$ optimal regularity estimates in H\"older spaces $\unicode{x2013}$ and well-posedness results for mild and classical solutions of fractional Hamilton-Jacobi equations with subcritical nonlocal diffusions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Due to an interplay between the regularity of the initial data and the growth of the Hamiltonian in the gradient, we focus on two canonical cases: (i) Lipschitz initial data and general Hamiltonians that are H\"older in space and merely locally Lipschitz in the gradient, and (ii) H\"older initial data and Hamiltonians that are H\"older in space and locally Lipschitz with power growth in the gradient. We compute explicit blow-up rates for $C^1$ and higher order H\"older norms as $t \to 0$. The results include short time and long time existence for mild solutions, optimal regularity in H\"older spaces and corresponding Schauder a priori estimates, and that smooth mild solutions are classical solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in contrast to the case of Laplace eigenfunctions, the nodal set of high energy eigenfunctions of the clamped plate problem is not necessarily dense, and can in fact exhibit macroscopic "nodal voids". Specifically, we show that there are small deformations of the unit disk admitting a clamped plate eigenfunction of arbitrarily high frequency that does not vanish in a disk of radius 0.44.</description>

      <title>Free Boundary Problem for inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08039v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study free boundary problems for incompressible inhomogeneous flows governed by the Navier--Stokes equations, focusing on the regularity and global-in-time well-posedness of solutions in critical functional frameworks for small initial data.
  We introduce a novel analytical framework for free boundary problems formulated as perturbations of the half-space. Our approach relies on the natural Lagrangian change of coordinates and a detailed analysis of the linearized problem (the Stokes system) in the maximal regularity regime, formulated in the Lebesgue spaces $L_p(0,T; L_q)$, including time-weighted variants. The main difficulty lies in the treatment of boundary terms, for which we apply a new technique based on complex interpolation to control nonlinear terms in fractional Sobolev spaces. This strategy also allows us to handle the case of variable density, which is not easily addressed by approaches based on Besov spaces.
  Using this framework and real interpolation techniques, we construct also solutions in the Lorentz class $L_{p,1}(0,T; L_q)$ in time. The method further enables a rigorous study of the stability of equilibrium configurations. In particular, we resolve the problem in two spatial dimensions, where the interplay between geometry and regularity is especially subtle. Beyond these specific applications, the proposed approach provides a powerful tool for broader classes of nonlinear PDEs and further developments in maximal regularity theory.</description>

      <title>Regularity for fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations with strong absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate dead-core problems for fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations with strong absorption, \begin{equation*}
  |Du|^{p} F(D^{2}u) - u_{t} = \lambda_{0}(x,t)\, u^{\mu}\, \chi_{\{u&gt;0\}}(x,t)
  \qquad \text{in } \quad Q_{T} := Q \times (0,T), \end{equation*} where $0 \leq p &lt; \infty$ and $0 &lt; \mu &lt; 1$. We establish a sharp and improved parabolic $C^{\alpha}$-regularity estimate along the free boundary $\partial \{ u &gt; 0 \}$, where \[ \alpha := \frac{2+p}{1+p-\mu} &gt; 1 + \frac{1}{1+p}. \] Moreover, we establish weak geometric properties of solutions, such as non-degeneracy and uniform positive density. As an application, we obtain a Liouville-type theorem for entire solutions and gradient bounds. Finally, as a byproduct of our approach, we derive a novel $L^{\delta}$-average estimate for fully nonlinear singular elliptic equations and present a new formulation of the gradient decay property. It is worth noting that the results presented here extend those in da Silva {\it et al.} ({\it Pacific J. Math}., \textbf{300} (2019), 179--213) and ({\it J. Differential Equations}., \textbf{264} (2018), 7270--7293) to the degenerate setting, and can be viewed as a parabolic analogue of da Silva {\it et al.} ({\it Math. Nachr}., \textbf{294} (2021), 38--55) and Teixeira ({\it Math. Ann}., \textbf{364} (2016), 1121--1134). Additionally, of independent mathematical interest, we emphasize that our manuscript establishes a comparison principle result and the compactness of viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic models with continuous and bounded forcing terms. These compactness and comparison properties serve as key ingredients in deriving enhanced regularity estimates along free boundary points for our model problem with strong absorption.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck system in low-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the scaled Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP) system in the low-field regime. By employing the moment method, we formally derive the corresponding Drift-Diffusion-Poisson (DDP) system. Furthermore, we rigorously justify the pointwise convergence from the VPFP system to the DDP system through delicate high-order energy estimates based on the Macro-Micro decomposition. The main difficulty lies in controlling the nonlinear coupling between the kinetic and electrostatic fields and establishing uniform bounds with respect to the scaling parameter. These challenges are overcome by developing refined high-order energy methods that yield uniform energy estimates and ensure the global well-posedness of smooth solutions, without relying on any a priori assumptions for the limiting DDP system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spatially inhomogeneous Kac equation with a non-cutoff cross section in a setting close to equilibrium. We prove that the solution to the Cauchy problem exhibits a sharp Gevrey-Gelfand-Shilov smoothing effect with an optimal radius. We employ a well-chosen exponential-type Fourier multiplier to establish the smoothing effect for position and velocity variables.</description>

      <title>A Class of Non-linear Anisotropic Elliptic problems with Unbounded Coefficients and Singular Quadratic Lower Order Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the existence and regularity results of anisotropic elliptic equations with a singular lower order term that grows naturally with respect to the gradient and unbounded coefficients. We take up the following model problem \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{ll}-\displaystyle\sum\limits_{j\in J} D_{j}\left(\left[ 1+ u^{q}\right]\vert D_{j}u\vert^{p_{j}-2} D_{j}u\right)+\sum\limits_{j\in J}\frac{\vert D_{j}u\vert^{p_{j}}}{ u^{\theta}}=f&amp; \hbox{in}\;\Omega, \\ u&gt;0&amp; \hbox{in}\;\Omega,
  u =0 &amp; \hbox{on}\; \partial\Omega, \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation*} $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, $j\in J=\{1,2,\ldots,N\},$ $q&gt;0$, $0&lt; \theta&lt;1$, $2\leq p_{1}\leq p_{2}\leq... \leq p_{N}$ and $f\in L^{1}(\Omega)$. Our study's conclusions will depend on the values of $q$ and $\theta$.</description>

      <title>Global Leray-Schauder continuation for Fredholm operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper ascertains the global behavior of the forward and backward branches of solutions provided by the Leray-Schauder continuation theorem for orientable $\mathcal{C}^1$ Fredholm maps, as developed by the authors in [54]. Under properness on bounded sets and a nonzero local index at the given base solution, each branch satisfies the following alternative: either it is unbounded, or it reaches the boundary of the domain, or it accumulates at a different solution on the base parameter level. When the component is bounded and stays in the interior, there is a degree balance on the base slice entailing a vanishing sum of local indices and, in particular, the existence of an even number of non-degenerate contact points. For real-analytic maps we construct locally injective parameterizations that exhibit blow-up, approach to the boundary, or return to the base level. An application to a quasilinear boundary value problem driven by the mean-curvature and Minkowski operators illustrates the global results.</description>

      <title>Scattering from a random thin coating of nanoparticles: the Dirichlet case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time-harmonic scattering by a heterogeneous object covered with a thin layer of randomly distributed sound-soft nanoparticles. The size of the particles, their distance between each other and the layer's thickness are all of the same order but small compared to the wavelength of the incident wave. Solving the Helmholtz equation in this context can be very costly and the simulation depends on the given distribution of particles. To circumvent this, we propose, via a multi-scale asymptotic expansion of the solution, an effective model where the layer of particles is replaced by an equivalent boundary condition. The coefficients that appear in this equivalent boundary condition depend on the solutions to corrector problems of Laplace type defined on unbounded random domains. Under the assumption that the particles are distributed given a stationary and mixing random point process, we prove that those problems admit a unique solution in the proper space. We then establish quantitative error estimates for the effec tive model and present numerical simulations that illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stability of $n$-soliton solutions for the Intermediate Long Wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the stability of $n$-soliton solutions ($n\in \mathbb{N}, n\geq 1$) to the completely integrable intermediate long wave equation (ILW), which models long internal gravity waves in a stratified fluid of finite depth. We show that the $n$-soliton solutions of the ILW equation form non-isolated constrained minimizers of a variational problem associated with a non-local elliptic equation. To establish this result, we construct a suitable Lyapunov functional and utilize the inverse scattering transform to relate the infinite sequence of conservation laws to the scattering data. Furthermore, we employ the recursion operator derived from the bi-Hamiltonian structure to optimize our analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that the $n$-soliton solutions of the ILW equation are dynamically stable in the space $H^{\frac{n}{2}}(\mathbb{R})$ ($n\in \mathbb{N}, n\geq 1$). Additionally, we establish the orbital stability of double soliton solutions in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Improved Local Well-Posedness in Sobolev Spaces for Two-Dimensional Compressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations with initial velocity $\bv_0$, logarithmic density $\rho_0$, and specific vorticity \(w_0\), which satisfy $(\bv_0, \rho_0, w_0, \nabla w_0)\in H^{\frac74+}(\mathbb{R}^2)\times H^{\frac74+}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^{\frac32}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times L^{8}(\mathbb{R}^2)$.
  The proof applies Smith-Tataru method \cite{ST} and the inherent wave-transport structure of the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations. The key observation is that Strichartz estimates hold when the regularity requirement for vorticity is lower than that for velocity and density, even though the gradient of vorticity appears as a source term in the velocity wave equation. Furthermore, our result presents an improvement of $\frac{1}{4}$-order regularity compared to previous results \cite{Z1} and \cite{Z2}.</description>

      <title>Global Weak Solutions for the High--Friction Quantum Navier--Stokes--Poisson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1], the Authors rigorously establish the relaxation limit from the Quantum Navier Stokes Poisson (QNSP) system to the Quantum Drift Diffusion (QDD) equation, while providing only a brief outline of the global existence theory for weak solutions to QNSP in the high friction regime (see Appendix A therein). In this manuscript, we present a complete and fully self contained proof of global existence.
  More precisely, we prove the global existence of finite energy weak solutions to the QNSP system with high friction and large initial data on the three-dimensional torus. The model describes a compressible, viscous quantum fluid with Korteweg type capillarity effects, and allows for degenerate viscosity and vacuum regions.
  The construction proceeds in two main steps. First, it is introduced a Faedo Galerkin approximation endowed with suitable damping mechanisms, which yields smooth approximate solutions through compactness arguments. Then, it will be justify the convergence of the approximating sequence by combining a truncation of the momentum equation with DiPerna Lions commutator estimates, providing the required control over the nonlinear transport structure.</description>

Abstract: We study the mixed Christoffel problem for $C^{2,+}$ convex bodies providing sufficient conditions for its solution. Key to our approach is a constant rank theorem, following the approach developed in \cite{Guan-Ma-2003} to address the Christoffel problem, in order to ensure that the solution to a related second order linear PDE on the sphere is indeed geometric, that is, it is the support functions of a $C^{2,+}$ convex body.</description>

We prove that a unique mild solution exists in an appropriate Sobolev-Gevrey class and analyze its behavior up to the maximal time of existence. In particular, we derive quantitative lower bounds describing how the norm of the solution must blow up as it approaches a finite maximal time. As a corollary, we deduce that the solution exhibits exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Norm Inflation For The Critical SQG Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the critical dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation on $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{T}^2$. Despite global regularity of the equation, we show that the data-to-solution map at the critical level $H^1$ is not uniformly bounded. We construct solutions that experience $H^1$ norm inflation from smooth, compactly supported initial data with large $H^1$ norm. We also demonstrate small-data norm inflation in supercritical Sobolev spaces $W^{\beta,p}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;2$ and $1\le\beta&lt;\tfrac{2}{p}$.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of kinks in the NLS equation with competing nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinks connecting zero and nonzero equilibria in the NLS equation with competing nonlinearities occur at the special values of the frequency parameter. Since they are minimizers of energy, they are expected to be orbitally stable in the time evolution of the NLS equation. However, the stability proof is complicated by the degeneracy of kinks near the nonzero equilibrium. The main purpose of this work is to give a rigorous proof of the orbital stability of kinks. We give details of analysis for the cubic--quintic NLS equation and show how the proof is extended to the general case.</description>

      <title>The Maxwell equations on full sub-extremal and extremal Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the Maxwell equations in the exterior region of Kerr black hole spacetimes. The equations are formulated for components of the Maxwell field relative to the algebraically special frame of Kerr, with the unknowns treated as tensorial quantities associated with a non-integrable horizontal distribution. The extremal Maxwell components decouple into Teukolsky equations, whereas the middle Maxwell components form a coupled system of transport and elliptic equations. Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|&lt;=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon.
  In the sub-extremal |a|&lt;M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations.
  In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon. Our boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations remain, therefore, conditional. We show that the complicated dynamics of the extremal components at the event horizon is inherited by the middle components; in particular, we uncover novel conservation laws for the middle components of axisymmetric solutions.</description>

      <title>On a cross-diffusion hybrid model: Cancer Invasion Tissue with Normal Cell Involved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a well-posedness problem on a new mathematical model for cancer invasion within the plasminogen activation system, which explicitly incorporates cooperation with host normal cells. Key biological mechanisms--including chemotaxis, haptotaxis, recruitment, logistic growth, and natural degradation of normal cells--along with other primary components (cancer cells, vitronectin, uPA, uPAI-1 and plasmin) are modeled via a continuum framework of cancer cell invasion of the extracellular matrix. The resulting model constitutes a strongly coupled, cross-diffusion hybrid system of differential equations. The primary mathematical challenges arise from the strongly coupled cross-diffusion terms, the parabolic operators of divergence form, and the interaction between the cross-diffusion fluxes and the ODE components. We address these by deriving several a priori estimates for dimensions d less or equal to 3. Subsequently, we employ a decoupling strategy to split the system into proper sub-problems, establishing the existence (and uniqueness) for each subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate the global existence and uniqueness of the solution for dimensions d less or equal to 2 and the global existence of a solution for dimension d = 3.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Accelerated Physics-Informed Quantum Neural Network for Multiscale Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a wavelet-based physics-informed quantum neural network framework to efficiently address multiscale partial differential equations that involve sharp gradients, stiffness, rapid local variations, and highly oscillatory behavior. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence, uniqueness and regularity of weak solutions of Kolmogorov--Fokker--Planck equations with either local or non-local diffusion in the velocity variable and rough diffusion coefficients or kernels. Our results cover the Cauchy problem and allow a broad class of source terms under minimal assumptions. The core of the analysis is a set of sharp kinetic embeddings \`a la Lions and transfer-of-regularity results \`a la Bouchut--H\''ormander. We formulate these tools in a homogeneous, scale-invariant form, available for a large range of regularity parameters.</description>

Abstract: We give a rigorous proof for the existence of a finite-energy, self-similar solution to the focusing cubic Schr\"odinger equation in three spatial dimensions. The proof is computer-assisted and relies on a fixed point argument that shows the existence of a solution in the vicinity of a numerically constructed approximation. The latter is obtained by a standard pseudo-spectral method. The computer-assisted part of the rigorous proof uses nothing but fraction arithmetic in order to obtain quantitative bounds for the fixed point argument.</description>

Abstract: We study geometrically constrained magnetic walls in a three dimensional geometry where two bulks are connected by a thin neck. Without imposing any symmetry assumption on the domain, we investigate the scaling of the energy as the size of the neck vanishes. We identify five significant scaling regimes, for all of which we characterise the energy scaling and identify the asymptotic behaviour of the domain wall. Finally, we notice the emergence of sub-regimes that are not present in the previous works due to restrictive symmetry assumptions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the continuous mild solutions to the Boltzmann equation in a bounded spatial domain, under either angular cutoff assumption or non-cutoff assumption. Without assuming convexity of the spatial domain, we establish a Maxwellian lower bound in the cutoff case, and a weaker-than-Maxwellian lower bound for the non-cutoff case. This extends the results of \cite{Bri1,Bri2}, where the convexity of the domain was required.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of Subwavelength Resonance in Elastic Metascreen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and mathematically rigorous analysis on determining the existence of subwavelength resonance in elastic metascreen and resonance frequency calculation based on asymptotic analysis of quasi-periodic layer potential operators. An elastic metascreen is a thin sheet with subwavelength structures, which nevertheless has a significant effect on elastic wave propagation at specific frequencies. Periodic subwavelength elastic scatterers positioned on a reflective plane are considered in this paper. Firstly an explicit formula of quasi-periodic Green's function of Lam\'{e} system with Dirichlet boundary condition is derived for the first time. The subsequent discussion is twofold. In the first part where the shear modulus of scatterers is assumed to tend to infinity, the subwavelength resonance frequencies are given and approximated field inside inclusions and far-away from metascreen are calculated to demonstrate the dramatic change of scattered field due to subwavelength resonance. In the second part where the shear modulus of background is assumed to go to infinity, the absence of subwavelength resonance is proved. Without imposing conditions on the material parameters, the discussion in this paper provides the necessary condition for the occurrence of subwavelength resonance.</description>

Abstract: We provide sharp boundary regularity estimates for solutions to elliptic equations driven by an integro-differential operator obtained as the sum of a Laplacian with a nonlocal operator generalizing a fractional Laplacian.
  Our approach makes use of weighted H\"older spaces as well as regularity estimates for the Laplacian in this context and a fixed-point argument.
  We show the optimality of the obtained estimates by means of a counterexample that we have striven to keep as explicit as possible.</description>

      <title>On positive solutions of Lane-Emden equations on the integer lattice graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and nonexistence of positive solutions to the Lane-Emden equations $$ -\Delta u = Q |u|^{p-2}u $$ on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as in the half-space and quadrant domains, under the zero Dirichlet boundary condition in the latter two cases. Here, $d \geq 2$, $p &gt; 0$, and $Q$ denotes a Hardy-type positive potential satisfying $Q(x) \sim (1+|x|)^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in [0, +\infty]$. \smallskip
  We identify the Sobolev super-critical regions of the parameter pair $(\alpha, p)$ for which the existence of positive solutions is established via variational methods. In contrast, within the Serrin sub-critical regions of $(\alpha, p)$, we demonstrate nonexistence by iteratively analyzing the decay behavior at infinity, ultimately leading to a contradiction. Notably, in the full-space and half-space domains, there exists an intermediate regions between the Sobolev critical line and the Serrin critical line where the existence of positive solutions remains an open question. Such an intermediate region does not exist in the quadrant domain.</description>

      <title>Intermittent solutions of the stationary 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation in sharp $L^p$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct non-trivial solutions to the stationary dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation on the two dimensional torus which lie strictly below the critical regularity threshold of $\dot{H}^{-1/2}(\mathbb{T}^2)$. Specifically, for any $\alpha &lt; 1/2$ and any dissipation exponent $0 &lt; \gamma \leq 2$ we construct non-trivial solutions such that
  $$
  u,\theta \in \dot{B}^{\alpha-1}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{T}^2) \cap \dot{B}^{\alpha-1}_{2,2}(\mathbb{T}^2).
  $$
  Due to the fact our solutions do not lie in $\dot{H}^{-1/2}(\mathbb{T}^2)$, this requires reinterpreting the notion of a solution. This leads us to formulate the notion of a weak paraproduct solution for the stationary SQG equation. The main new ingredient is the incorporation of intermittency into the construction of the solutions. This allows us to demonstrate non-trivial integrability results for certain fractional derivatives of our solutions. In particular, for highly intermittent solutions, we are able to conclude for every $1 \leq p &lt; 4/3$ we can construct $u$ and $\theta$ lying in $L^p(\mathbb{T}^2)$. This result is sharp with respect to $L^p(\mathbb{T}^2)$ integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linearized 2D Euler equations around radial vortex profiles. Previous works have shown that the strict monotonicity of the vorticity profile leads to axisymmetrization and inviscid damping of non-radial perturbations.
  Given any strictly decreasing radial vortex, we construct arbitrarily close (in low H\"{o}lder norms $C^\alpha$, with $0&lt;\alpha &lt; 1$) radial profiles that are merely non-increasing, for which non-radial, time-periodic solutions to the linearized equation exist. This shows that both axisymmetrization and inviscid damping are not robust under small, low-regularity perturbations of the background profile that violate strict monotonicity.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>
