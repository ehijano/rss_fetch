      <title>Stability of rotating magnetic levitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical magnetic levitation has attracted broad interest in the realm of physics and engineering. The stability analysis of such system is of great significance for practical applications. In this work, we investigate the stable magnetic levitation of a floater magnet above a rotating magnet and copper board system. The conditions for stable levitation are analyzed through both theoretical modeling and experimental observation. This study focuses on the interplay between magnetic forces, damping effects from the copper board, and rotational dynamics. We derive the equilibrium conditions, perform stability analysis, and present phase diagrams in parametric spaces of rotation speed and damping coefficients. The theoretical predictions show qualitative agreement with experimental results, particularly in demonstrating how damping is essential for stable levitation and how the stability region depends on the geometric and magnetic parameters of the system.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted in an attempt to validate the models. In this article, these models are augmented by taking into account the effects of external forces that are modeled as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium distribution function for strongly nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium distribution function determines macroscopic observables in statistical physics. While conventional methods correct equilibrium distributions in weakly nonlinear or near-integrable systems, they fail in strongly nonlinear regimes. We develop a framework to get the equilibrium distributions and dispersion relations in strongly nonlinear many-body systems, incorporating corrections beyond the random phase approximation and capturing intrinsic nonlinear effects. The theory is verified on the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model, and the FPUT-beta model, demonstrating its accuracy across distinct types of nonlinear systems. Numerical results show substantial improvements over existing approaches, even in strong nonlinear regimes. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for equilibrium statistical properties in strongly nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Special-Unitary Operations in Classical Mechanics by Nonadiabatic Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial classical wave systems such as wave crystals and metamaterials have demonstrated promising capabilities in simulating a wide range of quantum mechanical phenomena. Yet some gaps between quantum and classical worlds are generally considered fundamental and difficult to bridge. Dynamics obeying special unitary groups, e.g., electronic spins described by SU(2), color symmetries of fundamental particles described by SU(3), are such examples. In this Letter, we present the experimental realization of universal SU(2) and SU(3) dynamic operations in classical mechanical oscillator systems with temporally modulated coupling terms. Our approach relies on the sequential execution of non-adiabatic holonomic evolutions, which are typically used in constructing quantum-logic gates. The method is swift and purely geometric and can be extended to realize more sophisticated dynamic operations. Our results open a new way for studying and simulating quantum phenomena in classical systems.</description>

      <title>Exact anisotropic properties of hard spheres in narrow cylindrical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions occur. By mapping this Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical results for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial expansions, and the high-pressure regime. In particular, we identify a crossover in the anisotropic pressure components: at high densities, the transverse pressure overtakes the longitudinal one when the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. We also examine spatial correlations in particle arrangements and radial fluctuations, shedding light on the emergence of ordering in confined systems.</description>
