      <title>On the spectral redundancy of pineapple graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the concept of spectral redundancy within the class of pineapple graphs, denoted as $\mathcal{P}(\alpha,\beta)$. These graphs are constructed by attaching $\beta$ pendent edges to a single vertex of a complete graph $K_\alpha$. A connected graph $G$ earns the title of being spectrally non-redundant if the spectral radii of its connected induced subgraphs remain distinct. Spectral redundancy, on the other hand, arises when there is a repetition of spectral radii among the connected induced subgraphs within $G$. Specifically, we analyze the adjacency spectrum of $\mathcal{P}(\alpha,\beta)$, revealing distinct eigenvalues including $0$, $-1$, and additional eigenvalues, some negative and others positive. Our investigation focuses on determining the spectral redundancy within this class of graphs, shedding light on their unique structural properties and implications for graph theory.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for total positivity, compounds, and Dodgson condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $n$-by-$n$ matrix is called totally positive ($TP$) if all its minors are positive and $TP_k$ if all of its $k$-by-$k$ submatrices are $TP$. For an arbitrary totally positive matrix or $TP_k$ matrix, we investigate if the $r$th compound ($1&lt;r&lt;n$) is in turn $TP$ or $TP_k$, and demonstrate a strong negative resolution in general. Focus is then shifted to Dodgson's algorithm for calculating the determinant of a generic matrix, and we analyze whether the associated condensed matrices are possibly totally positive or $TP_k$. We also show that all condensed matrices associated with a $TP$ Hankel matrix are $TP$.</description>

      <title>Limit points of (singless) Laplacian spectral radii of linear trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study limit points of the spectral radii of Laplacian matrices of graphs. We adapted the method used by J. B. Shearer in 1989, devised to prove the density of adjacency limit points of caterpillars, to Laplacian limit points. We show that this fails, in the sense that there is an interval for which the method produces no limit points. Then we generalize the method to Laplacian limit points of linear trees and prove that it generates a larger set of limit points. The results of this manuscript may provide important tools for proving the density of Laplacian limit points in $[4.38+, \infty)$.</description>

      <title>On Kainen's conjectures on surface crossing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1972, Kainen proved a general lower bound on the crossing number of a graph in a closed surface and conjectured that this bound is tight when the graph is either a complete graph or a complete bipartite graph, and the surface is of genus close to the minimum genus of that graph. Prior to the present work, these conjectures were known to be true only for small cases and when the conjectures predict a crossing number of 0, i.e., when a triangular or quadrangular embedding was already known. We show that Kainen's conjectures are true except for the three graphs $K_9$, $K_{3,5}$, and $K_{5,5}$. We also prove nonorientable analogues of these conjectures, where the only exceptions to the general formulas are $K_7$ and $K_8$.</description>

      <title>Metrics on permutations with the same descent set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group on the set $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Given a permutation $\sigma=\sigma_1\sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_n \in S_n$, we say it has a descent at index $i$ if $\sigma_i&gt;\sigma_{i+1}$. Let $\mathcal{D}(\sigma)$ be the set of all descents of $\sigma$ and define $\mathcal{D}(S;n)=\{\sigma\in S_n\, | \,\mathcal{D}(\sigma)=S\}$. We study the Hamming metric and $\ell_\infty$-metric on the sets $\mathcal{D}(S;n)$ for all possible nonempty $S\subset[n-1]$ to determine the maximum possible value that these metrics can achieve when restricted to these subsets.</description>

      <title>On Certain Bounds for Multiset Dimensions of Zero-Divisor Graphs Associated with Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates multiset dimensions in zero divisor graphs (ZD-graphs) associated with rings. Through rigorous analysis, we establish general bounds for the multiset dimension (Mdim) in ZD-graphs, exploring various commutative rings including the ring Z_n of integers modulo n, Gaussian integers and quotient polynomial rings. Additionally, we examine the behavior of Mdim under algebraic operations and discuss bounds in terms of diameter and maximum degree. This study enhances our understanding of algebraic structures and their graphical representations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ring Structures: Multiset Dimension Analysis in Compressed Zero-Divisor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of multiset dimensions (Mdim) of compressed zero-divisor graphs (CZDG) associated with rings. The authors investigate the interplay between the ring-theoretic properties of a ring $R$ and the associated compressed zero-divisor graph. An undirected graph consisting of a vertex set $ Z(R_E)\backslash\{[0]\} = R_E\backslash\{[0],[1]\}$, where $R_E=\{[x] : x\in R\} $ and $[x]=\{y\in R : \text{ann}(x)=\text{ann}(y)\}$ is called a compressed zero-divisor graph, denoted by $\Gamma_E (R)$. An edge is formed between two vertices $[x]$ and $[y]$ of $Z(R_E)$ if and only if $[x][y]=[xy]=[0]$, that is, iff $xy=0$. For a ring $R$, graph $G$ is said to be realizable as $\Gamma_E (R) $ if $G$ is isomorphic to $\Gamma_E (R)$. We classify the rings based on Mdim of their associated CZDG and obtain the bounds for the Mdim of the compressed zero-divisor graphs. We also study the Mdim of realizable graphs of rings. Moreover, some examples are provided to support our results. Lately, we have discussed the interconnection between Mdim, girth, and diameter of CZDG.</description>

      <title>Sequence saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce saturation and semisaturation functions of sequences, and we prove a number of fundamental results about these functions. Given any forbidden sequence $u$ with $r$ distinct letters, we say that a sequence $s$ on a given alphabet is $u$-saturated if $s$ is $r$-sparse, $u$-free, and adding any letter from the alphabet to $s$ violates $r$-sparsity or induces a copy of $u$. We say that $s$ is $u$-semisaturated if $s$ is $r$-sparse and adding any letter from the alphabet to $s$ violates $r$-sparsity or induces a new copy of $u$. Let the saturation function $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n)$ denote the minimum possible length of a $u$-saturated sequence on an alphabet of size $n$, and let the semisaturation function $\operatorname{Ssat}(u, n)$ denote the minimum possible length of a $u$-semisaturated sequence on an alphabet of size $n$. For alternating sequences of the form $a b a b \dots$, we determine the saturation functions up to a multiplicative factor of $2$, and we determine the semisaturation functions up to the leading term. We demonstrate a dichotomy for the semisaturation functions of sequences: for any sequence $u$, we have $\operatorname{Ssat}(u, n) = O(1)$ if and only if the first letter and the last letter of $u$ each occur exactly once, and otherwise we have $\operatorname{Ssat}(u, n) = \Theta(n)$. For the saturation function, we show that every sequence $u$ has either $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n) \ge n$ for every positive integer $n$ or $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n) = O(1)$. We prove that every sequence $u$ in which every letter occurs at least twice has $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n) \ge n$, and we show that $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n) = \Theta(n)$ or $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n) = O(1)$ for every sequence $u$ with $2$ distinct letters.</description>

      <title>Recoloring via modular decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconfiguration graph of the $k$-colorings of a graph $G$, denoted $R_{k}(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colorings of $G$ and two colorings are adjacent in $R_{k}(G)$ if they differ in color on exactly one vertex. A graph $G$ is said to be recolorable if $R_{\ell}(G)$ is connected for all $\ell \geq \chi(G)$+1. We use the modular decomposition of several graph classes to prove that the graphs in the class are recolorable. In particular, we prove that every ($P_5$, diamond)-free graph, every ($P_5$, house, bull)-free graph, and every ($P_5$, $C_5$, co-fork)-free graph is recolorable.</description>

      <title>Absolute zeta functions and periodicity of quantum walks on cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, absolute zeta functions can be considered as zeta functions over $\mathbb{F}_1$. This study presents a connection between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions. In this paper, we focus on Hadamard walks and $3$-state Grover walks on cycle graphs. The Hadamard walks and the Grover walks are typical models of the quantum walks. We consider the periods and zeta functions of such quantum walks. Moreover, we derive the explicit forms of the absolute zeta functions of corresponding zeta functions. Also, it is shown that our zeta functions of quantum walks are absolute automorphic forms.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Mixing of the Kawasaki Dynamics on Bounded-Degree Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the worst-case mixing time of the global Kawasaki dynamics for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on the class of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$. Proving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that below the tree uniqueness threshold, the Kawasaki dynamics mix rapidly for all magnetizations. Disproving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that the regime of fast mixing does not extend throughout the regime of tractability for this model: there is a range of parameters for which there exist efficient sampling algorithms for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on max-degree $\Delta$ graphs, but the Kawasaki dynamics can take exponential time to mix. Our techniques involve showing spectral independence in the fixed-magnetization Ising model and proving a sharp threshold for the existence of multiple metastable states in the Ising model with external field on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Integer partitions detect the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that integer partitions, the fundamental building blocks in additive number theory, detect prime numbers in an unexpected way. Answering a question of Schneider, we show that the primes are the solutions to special equations in partition functions. For example, an integer $n\geq 2$ is prime if and only if
  $$
  (3n^3 - 13n^2 + 18n - 8)M_1(n) + (12n^2 - 120n + 212)M_2(n) -960M_3(n) = 0,
  $$
  where the $M_a(n)$ are MacMahon's well-studied partition functions. More generally, for "MacMahonesque" partition functions $M_{\vec{a}}(n),$ we prove that there are infinitely many such prime detecting equations with constant coefficients, such as 
  $$
  80M_{(1,1,1)}(n)-12M_{(2,0,1)}(n)+12M_{(2,1,0)}(n)+\dots-12M_{(1,3)}(n)-39M_{(3,1)}(n)=0.

      <title>Fast Mixing in Sparse Random Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the community detection problem in Bayesian inference, as well as the recent explosion of interest in spin glasses from statistical physics, we study the classical Glauber dynamics for sampling from Ising models with sparse random interactions. It is now well-known that when the interaction matrix has spectral diameter less than $1$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $O(n\log n)$ steps. Unfortunately, such criteria fail dramatically for interactions supported on arguably the most well-studied sparse random graph: the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, due to the presence of almost linearly many outlier eigenvalues of unbounded magnitude.
  We prove that for the \emph{Viana--Bray spin glass}, where the interactions are supported on $G(n,d/n)$ and randomly assigned $\pm\beta$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time with high probability as long as $\beta \le O(1/\sqrt{d})$, independent of $n$. We further extend our results to random graphs drawn according to the $2$-community stochastic block model, as well as when the interactions are given by a "centered" version of the adjacency matrix. The latter setting is particularly relevant for the inference problem in community detection. Indeed, we build on this result to demonstrate that Glauber dynamics succeeds at recovering communities in the stochastic block model in an upcoming paper.
  The primary technical ingredient in our proof is showing that with high probability, a sparse random graph can be decomposed into two parts --- a \emph{bulk} which behaves like a graph with bounded maximum degree and a well-behaved spectrum, and a \emph{near-forest} with favorable pseudorandom properties. We then use this decomposition to design a localization procedure that interpolates to simpler Ising models supported only on the near-forest, and then execute a pathwise analysis to establish a modified log-Sobolev inequality.</description>

Abstract: We present a combinatorial structure of generators of $D(\mathcal{A}).$ This structure permits us to detect the relationship between the combinatorial determined property and the singularity of vector field. Consequently, by using only combinatorial data, we have a basis of the module in free case and that yields a proof for the Terao's conjecture. We also verify the example of Ziegler and give a sufficient condition on combinatorial determined property of generators.</description>

      <title>Conformal Hypergraphs: Duality and Implications for the Upper Clique Transversal Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the dual hypergraph of $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $\mathcal{H}$. The dual hypergraph is always Sperner, that is, no hyperedge contains another. A special case of Sperner hypergraphs are the conformal Sperner hypergraphs, which correspond to the families of maximal cliques of graphs. All these notions play an important role in many fields of mathematics and computer science, including combinatorics, algebra, database theory, etc. In this paper we study conformality of dual hypergraphs and prove several results related to the problem of recognizing this property. In particular, we show that the problem is in co-NP and can be solved in polynomial time for hypergraphs of bounded dimension. In the special case of dimension $3$, we reduce the problem to $2$-Satisfiability. Our approach has an implication in algorithmic graph theory: we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Counting edges in factorization graphs of numerical semigroup elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup $S$ is an additively-closed set of non-negative integers, and a factorization of an element $n$ of $S$ is an expression of $n$ as a sum of generators of $S$. It is known that for a given numerical semigroup $S$, the number of factorizations of $n$ coincides with a quasipolynomial (that is, a polynomial whose coefficients are periodic functions of $n$). One of the standard methods for computing certain semigroup-theoretic invariants involves assembling a graph or simplicial complex derived from the factorizations of $n$. In this paper, we prove that for two such graphs (which we call the factorization support graph and the trade graph), the number of edges coincides with a quasipolynomial function of $n$, and identify the degree, period, and leading coefficient of each. In the process, we uncover a surprising geometric connection: a combinatorially-assembled cubical complex that is homeomorphic to real projective space.</description>

      <title>Trail Trap: a variant of Partizan Edge Geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-player game played on undirected graphs called Trail Trap, which is a variant of a game known as Partizan Edge Geography. One player starts by choosing any edge and moving a token from one endpoint to the other; the other player then chooses a different edge and does the same. Alternating turns, each player moves their token along an unused edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex, until one player cannot move and loses. We present an algorithm to determine which player has a winning strategy when the graph is a tree, and partially characterize the trees on which a given player wins. Additionally, we show that Trail Trap is NP-hard, even for connected bipartite planar graphs with maximum degree $4$ as well as for disconnected graphs. We determine which player has a winning strategy for certain subclasses of complete bipartite graphs and grid graphs, and we propose several open problems for further study.</description>

      <title>Perturbation results for distance-edge-monitoring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foucaud et al. recently introduced and initiated the study of a new graph-theoretic concept in the area of network monitoring. Given a graph $G=(V(G), E(G))$, a set $M \subseteq V(G)$ is a distance-edge-monitoring set if for every edge $e \in E(G)$, there is a vertex $x \in M$ and a vertex $y \in V(G)$ such that the edge $e$ belongs to all shortest paths between $x$ and $y$. The smallest size of such a set in $G$ is denoted by $\operatorname{dem}(G)$. Denoted by $G-e$ (resp. $G \backslash u$) the subgraph of $G$ obtained by removing the edge $e$ from $G$ (resp. a vertex $u$ together with all its incident edges from $G$). In this paper, we first show that $\operatorname{dem}(G-e)- \operatorname{dem}(G)\leq 2$ for any graph $G$ and edge $e \in E(G)$. Moreover, the bound is sharp. Next, we construct two graphs $G$ and $H$ to show that $\operatorname{dem}(G)-\operatorname{dem}(G\setminus u)$ and $\operatorname{dem}(H\setminus v)-\operatorname{dem}(H)$ can be arbitrarily large, where $u \in V(G)$ and $v \in V(H)$. We also study the relation between $\operatorname{dem}(H)$ and $\operatorname{dem}(G)$, where $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. In the end, we give an algorithm to judge whether the distance-edge monitoring set still remain in the resulting graph when any edge of the graph $G$ is deleted.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Elementary Proof of Zorn's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zorn's Lemma is a well-known equivalent of the Axiom of Choice. It is usually regarded as a topic in axiomatic set theory, and its historically standard proof (from the Axiom of Choice) relies on transfinite recursion, a non-elementary set-theoretic machinery. However, the statement of Zorn's Lemma itself uses only elementary terminology for partially ordered sets. Therefore, it is worthy to establish a proof using only such elementary terminology. Following this line of study, we give a new simple proof of Zorn's Lemma, which does not even use the notion of a well-ordered set.</description>

      <title>Efficient set-theoretic algorithms for computing high-order Forman-Ricci curvature on abstract simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11763v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) is a potent and powerful tool for analysing empirical networks, as the distribution of the curvature values can identify structural information that is not readily detected by other geometrical methods. Crucially, FRC captures higher-order structural information of clique complexes of a graph or Vietoris-Rips complexes, which is not readily accessible to alternative methods. However, existing FRC platforms are prohibitively computationally expensive. Therefore, herein we develop an efficient set-theoretic formulation for computing such high-order FRC in simplicial complexes. Significantly, our set theory representation reveals previous computational bottlenecks and also accelerates the computation of FRC. Finally, We provide a pseudo-code, a software implementation coined FastForman, as well as a benchmark comparison with alternative implementations. We envisage that FastForman will be used in Topological and Geometrical Data analysis for high-dimensional complex data sets. Moreover, our development paves the way for future generalisations towards efficient computations of FRC on cell complexes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove the last remaining case of the original 15 two-term supercongruence conjectures for sporadic sequences. The proof utilizes a new representation for this sequence (due to Gorodetsky) as the constant term of powers of a Laurent polynomial.</description>

      <title>Restricted sumsets in $\mathbb{Z}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k\geqslant 3$ and let $A=\{0=a_{0}&lt;a_{1}&lt;\cdots&lt;a_{k-1}\}$ with $\gcd(A)=1$. Let $2^{\wedge}A$ denote the set of all sums of two distinct elements of $A$. Freiman and Lev conjectured that the cardinality of $2^{\wedge}A$ is greater than or equal to $a_{k-1}+k-2$ if $a_{k-1}\leqslant 2k-5$ and greater than or equal to $3k-7$ otherwise [V.F. Lev, Restricted set addition in groups, I. The classical setting, J. London Math. Soc. 62(2000), 27-40]. Up to now, Freiman-Lev conjecture is still open for all $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$. In this paper, we prove the Freiman-Lev conjecture is true for $a_{k-1}\geqslant 2k-2$ and $a_{k-2}&lt;2k-4$. Moreover, we determine some structures of $A$ when $|2^{\wedge}A|=3k-7$.</description>
