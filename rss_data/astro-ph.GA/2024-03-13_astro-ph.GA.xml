      <title>EIGER VI. The Correlation Function, Host Halo Mass and Duty Cycle of Luminous Quasars at $z\gtrsim6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expect luminous ($M_{1450}\lesssim-26.5$) high-redshift quasars to trace the highest density peaks in our universe, and therefore to reside in proto-clusters encompassing an abundance of galaxies in close vicinity. Here, we present observations of four $z\gtrsim6$ quasar fields using JWST/NIRCam in imaging and widefield slitless spectroscopy mode and report a wide range in the number of detected [OIII]-emitting galaxies in the quasars' environments, ranging between a density enhancement of $\delta&gt;100$ within a $2$ cMpc radius - one of the largest proto-clusters during the Epoch of Reionization discovered to date - to a density contrast consistent with zero, indicating the presence of a UV-luminous quasar in a region comparable to the average density of the universe. By measuring the two-point cross-correlation function of quasars and their surrounding galaxies, as well as the galaxy auto-correlation function, we infer a correlation length of quasars at $\langle z\rangle=6.25$ of $r_0^{\rm QQ}=21.3^{+2.7}_{-2.6}~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$, while we obtain a correlation length of the [OIII]-emitting galaxies of $r_0^{\rm GG}=4.2\pm0.1~{\rm cMpc}\,h^{-1}$. By comparing the correlation functions to dark-matter-only simulations we estimate the minimum mass of the quasars' host dark matter halos to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}/M_\odot)=12.30\pm0.14$ (and $\log_{10}(M_{\rm halo, min}^{\rm [OIII]}/M_\odot) = 10.72\pm0.03$ for the [OIII]-emitters), indicating that (a) luminous quasars do not necessarily reside within the most overdense regions in the early universe, and that (b) the UV-luminous duty cycle of quasar activity at these redshifts is $f_{\rm duty}\ll1$. Such short quasar activity timescales challenge our understanding of early supermassive black hole growth and provide evidence for highly dust-obscured growth phases or episodic, radiatively inefficient accretion rates.</description>

      <title>TriOS Schwarzschild Orbit Modeling: Robustness of Parameter Inference for Masses and Shapes of Triaxial Galaxies with Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for the majority of the supermassive black holes in the local universe has been obtained dynamically from stellar motions with the Schwarzschild orbit superposition method. However, there have been only a handful of studies using simulated data to examine the ability of this method to reliably recover known input black hole masses $M_{BH}$ and other galaxy parameters. Here we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the triaxial Schwarzschild method at $\textit{simultaneously}$ determining $M_{BH}$, stellar mass-to-light ratio $M^{*}/L$, dark matter mass, and three intrinsic triaxial shape parameters of simulated galaxies. For each of 25 rounds of mock observations using simulated stellar kinematics and the $\texttt{TriOS}$ code, we derive best-fitting parameters and confidence intervals after a full search in the 6D parameter space with our likelihood-based model inference scheme. The two key mass parameters, $M_{BH}$ and $M^{*}/L$, are recovered within the 68% confidence interval, and other parameters are recovered between 68% and 95% confidence intervals. The spatially varying velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits is also well recovered. We explore whether the goodness-of-fit measure used for galaxy model selection in our pipeline is biased by variable complexity across the 6D parameter space. In our tests, adding a penalty term to the likelihood measure either makes little difference, or worsens the recovery in some cases.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Properties of Molecular Gas Toward the Monoceros OB1 Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive CO study toward the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) region based on the MWISP survey at an angular resolution of about $50''$. The high-sensitivity data, together with the high dynamic range, shows that molecular gas in the $\rm 8^{\circ}\times4^{\circ}$ region displays complicated hierarchical structures and various morphology (e.g., filamentary, cavity-like, shell-like, and other irregular structures). Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ data, a total of 263 $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures are identified in the whole region, and 88\% of raw data flux is recovered. The dense gas with relatively high column density from the integrated CO emission is mainly concentrated in the region where multiple $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are overlapped. Combining the results of 32 large $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ structures with distances from Gaia DR3, we estimate an average distance of $\rm 729^{+45}_{-45}~pc$ for the GMC complex. The total mass of the GMC Complex traced by $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ are $1.1\times10^5~M_\odot$, $4.3\times10^4~M_\odot$, and $8.4\times10^3~M_\odot$, respectively. The dense gas fraction shows a clear difference between Mon OB1 GMC East (12.4\%) and Mon OB1 GMC West (3.3\%). Our results show that the dense gas environment is closely linked to the nearby star-forming regions. On the other hand, star-forming activities have a great influence on the physical properties of the surrounding molecular gas (e.g., greater velocity dispersion, higher temperatures, and more complex velocity structures, etc.). We also discuss the distribution/kinematics of molecular gas associated with nearby star-forming activities.</description>

      <title>Giant radio galaxies in the LOFAR deep fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we compare the radio, optical and environmental properties of GRGs with those of a control sample of smaller RGs we found in the three LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) deep fields, namely the Bootes, ELAIS-N1, Lockman Hole, for a total area of about 95 deg^2. We inspected the LOFAR deep fields and created a catalogue of 1609 extended radio galaxies (ERGs). By visual inspection, we identified their host galaxies and spectroscopically or photometrically classified 280 of these as GRGs. We studied their properties, such as their accretion state, stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) using deep optical and infrared survey data. Moreover, we explored the environment in terms of the surface number density of neighbouring galaxies within these surveys. Integrated flux densities and radio luminosities were also determined for a subset of ERGs through available survey images at 50, 150, 610, and 1400 MHz to compute integrated spectral indices. Considering the fraction of GRGs displaying an FRII morphology alongside the host galaxy properties, we suggest that GRGs consistently possess sufficient power to overcome jet frustration caused by the interstellar medium. Moreover, clear differences emerge in the environmental densities between GRGs and smaller RGs, using the number of neighbouring galaxies within 10 Mpc from the host galaxy as a proxy. GRGs preferentially reside in sparser environments compared to their smaller counterparts. In particular, only 3.6% of the GRGs reside within a 3D comoving distance of 5 Mpc from a previously reported galaxy cluster. We found that larger sources exhibit steeper integrated spectral indices, suggesting that GRGs are late-stage versions of RGs. These results suggest that GRGs are amongst the oldest radio sources with the most stable nuclear activity that reside in sparse environments.</description>

      <title>Chemical Cartography with APOGEE: Two-process Parameters and Residual Abundances for 288,789 Stars from Data Release 17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar abundance measurements are subject to systematic errors that induce extra scatter and artificial correlations in elemental abundance patterns. We derive empirical calibration offsets to remove systematic trends with surface gravity $\log(g)$ in 17 elemental abundances of 288,789 evolved stars from the SDSS APOGEE survey. We fit these corrected abundances as the sum of a prompt process tracing core-collapse supernovae and a delayed process tracing Type Ia supernovae, thus recasting each star's measurements into the amplitudes $A_{\text{cc}}$ and $A_{\text{Ia}}$ and the element-by-element residuals from this two-parameter fit. As a first application of this catalog, which is $8\times$ larger than that of previous analyses that used a restricted $\log(g)$ range, we examine the median residual abundances of 14 open clusters, nine globular clusters, and four dwarf satellite galaxies. Relative to field Milky Way disk stars, the open clusters younger than 2 Gyr show $\approx 0.1-0.2$ dex enhancements of the neutron-capture element Ce, and the two clusters younger than 0.5 Gyr also show elevated levels of C+N, Na, S, and Cu. Globular clusters show elevated median abundances of C+N, Na, Al, and Ce, and correlated abundance residuals that follow previously known trends. The four dwarf satellites show similar residual abundance patterns despite their different star formation histories, with $\approx 0.2-0.3$ dex depletions in C+N, Na, and Al and $\approx 0.1$ dex depletions in Ni, V, Mn, and Co. We provide our catalog of corrected APOGEE abundances, two-process amplitudes, and residual abundances, which will be valuable for future studies of abundance patterns in different stellar populations and of additional enrichment processes that affect galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE). I. Early ALMA Survey: observations and massive data reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Recent molecular surveys have revealed a rich gas organization of sonic-like fibers in all kind of environments prior to the formation of low- and high-mass stars. This paper introduces the EMERGE project aiming to investigate whether complex fiber arrangements could explain the origin of high-mass stars and clusters. We analyzed the EMERGE Early ALMA Survey including 7 star-forming regions in Orion (OMC-1/2/3/4 South, L1641N, NGC2023, and Flame Nebula) homogeneously surveyed in both molecular lines (N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, HNC J=1-0, plus HC3N J=10-9) and 3mm-continuum using a combination of interferometric ALMA mosaics and IRAM-30m single-dish (SD) maps. Based on our low-resolution (SD) observations, we describe the global properties of our sample covering a wide range of physical conditions including low-, intermediate, and high-mass star-forming regions in different evolutionary stages. Their comparison with ancillary YSO catalogs denotes N$_2$H$^+$ as the best proxy for the dense, star-forming gas in our targets showing a constant star formation efficiency and a fast time evolution of &lt;1 Myr. While apparently clumpy and filamentary in our SD data, all targets show a much more complex fibrous substructure at the enhanced resolution of our ALMA+IRAM-30m maps. A large number of filamentary features at sub-parsec scales are clearly recognized in the high-density gas traced by N$_2$H$^+$ directly connected to the formation of individual protostars. This complex gas organization appears to extend further into the more diffuse gas traced by HNC. This paper presents the EMERGE Early ALMA survey including a first data release of continuum maps and spectral products for this project to be analysed in future papers of this series. A first look at these results illustrates the need of advanced data combination techniques to investigate the intrinsic multi-scale, gas structure of the ISM.</description>

      <title>VODKA-JWST: Synchronized growth of two SMBHs in a massive gas disk? A 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar at cosmic noon with JWST NIRSpec IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may be an important route to fuel and to produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs can be observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to systematically search for such dual quasars at previously unreachable sub-kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. Here we present the first detailed study of a 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation, VODKA-selected dual quasar, J0749+2255, at $z=2.17$ using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. This is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars identified today. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, best traced by the narrow \ha\ emission. Line ratio diagnostics show a mix of ionization from the two quasars and intense star formation. The spatially-resolved spectra of the two quasars suggest that they have very similar black hole properties (two $M_{BH}\sim 10^9\ \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ with large Eddington ratio reaching $L/L_{Edd}\sim0.2$) hinting at the possible synchronized growth and accretion from the same gas supply. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest an extended, rotating disk rather than a disturbed system that would be expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. While it is unclear if J0749+2255 is representative of the dual quasar evolution, the observations with JWST revealed a major puzzle. It would be interesting to see what observations of other dual quasars will show.</description>

      <title>Excited-State OH Masers in the Water Fountain Source IRAS 18460-0151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water fountain objects are generally defined as "evolved stars with low to intermediate initial mass accompanied by high-velocity molecular jets detectable in the 22.235 GHz H$_2$O maser line". They are the key objects of understanding the morphological transitions of circumstellar envelopes during the post asymptotic giant branch phase. Masers are useful tools to trace the kinematic environments of the circumstellar envelopes. In this letter we report the discovery of exceptionally uncommon excited-state hydroxyl (ex-OH) masers at 4660 and 6031 MHz toward the water fountain source IRAS 18460-0151. These are the brightest ex-OH masers discovered in late-type objects to date. To the best of our knowledge, prior to the current work, no evolved stellar object has been observed in the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line. The ground-state hydroxyl (g-OH) masers at 1612 and 1665 MHz are also observed. The velocity components of the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line and the much weaker 1665 MHz g-OH maser line all can be seen in the 1612 MHz g-OH maser line profile. The blue-shifted components of the three masers are more intense than the red-shifted ones, in contrast to the ex-OH maser line at 6031 MHz. The relevance of the behaviors of the ex-OH masers to the circumstellar environments is unclear.</description>

      <title>Probing the stellar populations and star formation history of early-type galaxies at $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.1$ in the rest-frame ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the evolution of the rest-frame $NUV-V$ colors for early-type galaxies in clusters at $0&lt;z&lt;1.1$ using data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), CFHT Large Area U-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS) and local SDSS clusters observed with GALEX. Our results show that there is an excess in the ultraviolet spectrum in most quiescent galaxies (compared to the expectations from models fitting their optical/infrared colors and spectra) below $z\sim0.6$, beyond which the excess UV emission fades rapidly. This evolution of the UV color is only consistent with the presence of a highly evolved, hot horizontal branch sub-population in these galaxies (amongst the majority cool and optically bright stars), comprising on average 10\% of the total stellar mass and forming at $z&gt;3$. The blue UV colors of early-type galaxies at low-intermediate redshifts are likely driven by this sub-population being enriched in helium up to $\sim44\%$. At $z&gt;0.8$ (when the extra UV component has not yet appeared) the data allows us to constrain the star formation histories of galaxies by fitting models to the evolution of their UV colors: we find that the epoch at which the stellar populations formed ranges between $3&lt;z_{form}&lt;10$ (corresponding to $0.5-2.2$ Gyrs after the Big Bang) with a star-formation e-folding timescale of $\tau=0.35-0.7$ Gyr, suggesting that these galaxies formed the majority of stars at very high redshift, with a brief yet intense burst of star-formation activity. The star formation history and chemical evolution of early-type galaxies resemble those of globular clusters, albeit on much larger scales.</description>

      <title>Positive Lynden-Bell derivative as a ticket to the bar trap?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have translated the results of $N$-body simulations of one barred model into the language of action variables and frequencies. Using this language, we analysed the behaviour of all orbits in the model on a large time scale at the stage of a mature bar. We show that the orbits join the bar while preserving their adiabatic invariant, which takes into account the 3D structure of the orbits. This allows us to apply the concept of the Lynden-Bell derivative for each of these orbits and trace how the sign of the derivative changes, i.e. how asynchronous changes in angular momentum $L_z$ and orbital precession rate $\Omega_\mathrm{pr}$ (normal orbital mode) change to synchronous (abnormal mode). The transition to the abnormal mode occurs when $\Omega_\mathrm{pr}$ reaches the angular velocity of the pattern $\Omega_\mathrm{p}$, after which the orbit becomes stuck in the bar trap. All this happens against the background of secular changes in actions ($L_z$ decreases, $J_\mathrm{R}$ and $J_z$ increase). At the same time, corotation particles near two stable Lagrange points are also subject to secular changes in their actions. They increase $L_z$ and drift to the periphery, shifting corotation outwards. We also show that a change in the orbital mode from normal to abnormal and the trapping of orbits in a bar is possible only when the bar speed decreases with time, regardless of what is causing the bar to slow down. Our findings clarify and expand the picture of bar formation and evolution in numerical models.</description>

      <title>Observational tests in scale invariance II: gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the path of light rays passing near a massive object, in the context of the scale invariant equation of the geodesics first obtained by Dirac (1973). Using the exterior Schwarzschild solution for the metric, we derive the complete equations of the geodesics in the scale invariant context. We find that scale invariance introduces two additional terms to the Einstein term producing the deflection angle and that can potentially act over cosmological distances. Numerical integration of the scale-invariant geodesics, for the specific case of the z_L=1.94 lens galaxy in the extreme system JWST-ER1 (van Dokkum et al. 2023) shows that the two additional terms introduce only negligible effects, typically 1E-06 of the Einstein term. We conclude that the lensing deflection angle derived in Einstein's General Relativity is essentially independent of the scale invariant effects and that the photon's geodesics remain unchanged. We also explore the possible origin of the differences in the mass estimates from lensing and photometry in JWST-ER1 and in the SLACS galaxies, differences which appear larger at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>CLASSY IX: The Chemical Evolution of the Ne, S, Cl, and Ar Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the chemical evolution across cosmic epochs, we investigate Ne, S, Cl, and Ar abundance patterns in the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). CLASSY comprises local star-forming galaxies (0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.18) with enhanced star-formation rates, making them strong analogues to high-z star-forming galaxies. With direct measurements of electron temperature, we derive accurate ionic abundances for all elements and assess ionization correction factors (ICFs) to account for unseen ions and derive total abundances. We find Ne/O, S/O, Cl/O, and Ar/O exhibit constant trends with gas-phase metallicity for 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.5 but significant correlation for Ne/O and Ar/O with metallicity for 12+log(O/H) &gt; 8.5, likely due to ICFs. Thus, applicability of the ICFs to integrated spectra of galaxies could bias results, underestimating true abundance ratios. Using CLASSY as a local reference, we assess the evolution of Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O in galaxies at z&gt;3, finding no cosmic evolution of Ne/O, while the lack of direct abundance determinations for S/O and Ar/O can bias the interpretation of the evolution of these elements. We determine the fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for CLASSY and compare to the high-redshift FMR, finding no evolution. Finally, we perform the first mass-neon relationship analysis across cosmic epochs, finding a slight evolution to high Ne at later epochs. The robust abundance patterns of CLASSY galaxies and their broad range of physical properties provide essential benchmarks for interpreting the chemical enrichment of the early galaxies observed with the JWST.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved emission lines in galaxies at $4\leq z &lt; 10$ from the JADES survey: evidence for enhanced central star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first statistical investigation of spatially resolved emission-line properties in a sample of 63 low-mass galaxies at $4\leq z&lt;10$, using JWST/NIRSpec MSA data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic (JADES) survey focusing on deep, spatially resolved spectroscopy in the GOODS-S extragalactic field. By performing a stacking of the 2D spectra of the galaxies in our sample, we find an increasing or flat radial trend with increasing radius for [OIII]$\lambda5007$/H$\beta$ and a decreasing one for [NeIII]$\lambda3869$/[OII]$\lambda3727$ (3--4 $\sigma$ significance). These results are still valid when stacking the sample in two redshift bins (i.e., $4\leq z&lt;5.5$ and $5.5\leq z&lt;10$). The comparison with star-formation photoionization models suggests that the ionization parameter increases by $\sim 0.5$ dex with redshift. We find a tentative metallicity gradient that increases with radius (i.e., 'inverted') in both redshift bins. Moreover, our analysis reveals strong negative gradients for the equivalent width of \Hbeta (7$\sigma$ significance). This trend persists even after removing known AGN candidates, therefore, it is consistent with a radial gradient primarily in stellar age and secondarily in metallicity. Taken all together, our results suggest that the sample is dominated by active central star formation, with possibly inverted metallicity gradients sustained by recent episodes of accretion of pristine gas or strong radial flows. Deeper observations and larger samples are needed to confirm these preliminary results and to validate our interpretation.</description>

      <title>Photocleavage of aliphatic C--C bonds in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) processing in the insterstellar medium (ISM) induces the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Aliphatics, including alkanes, are present in different interstellar environments, being prevalently formed in evolved stars; thus, the dehydrogenation by UV photoprocessing of alkanes plays an important role in the chemistry of the ISM, leading to the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and eventually to aromatics, the latter ubiquitously detected in the ISM. Here, through combined experimental results and \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we show that UV absorption (mainly at the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm) promotes an alkane to an excited Rydberg state from where it evolves towards fragmentation inducing the formation of olefinic C=C bonds, which are necessary precursors of aromatic hydrocarbons. We show that photochemistry of aliphatics in the ISM does not primarily produce direct hydrogen elimination but preferential C-C photocleavage. Our results provide an efficient synthetic route for the formation of unsaturated aliphatics, including propene and dienes, and suggest that aromatics could be formed in dark clouds by a bottom-up mechanism involving molecular fragments produced by UV photoprocessing of aliphatics.</description>

      <title>What Does the Large Magellanic Cloud Look Like? It Depends on [M/H] and Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a new way to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud through stellar mono-abundance and mono-age-mono-abundance maps. These maps are based on $\gtrsim 500\,000$ member stars with photo-spectroscopic [M/H] and age estimates from Gaia DR3 data, and they are the first area-complete, metallicity- and age-differentiated stellar maps of any disk galaxy. Azimuthally averaged, these maps reveal a surprisingly simple picture of the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy. For any [M/H] below -0.1 dex, the LMC's radial profile is well described by a simple exponential, but with a scale length that steadily shrinks towards higher metallicities, from nearly 2.3~kpc at [M/H]$=-1.8$ to only 0.75~kpc at [M/H]$=-0.25$. The prominence of the bar decreases dramatically with [M/H], making it barely discernible at [M/H]$\lesssim -1.5$. Yet, even for metal-rich populations, the bar has little impact on the azimuthally averaged profile of the mono-abundance components. Including ages, we find that the scale length is a greater function of age than of metallicity, with younger populations far more centrally concentrated. At old ages, the scale length decreases with increasing metallicity; at young ages, the scale-length is independent of metallicity. These findings provide quantitative support for a scenario where the LMC built its stellar structure effectively outside in.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cold streams in hot gaseous halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the prevailing model of galaxy formation and evolution, the process of gas accretion onto central galaxies undergoes a transition from cold-dominated to hot-dominated modes. This shift occurs when the mass of the parent dark matter halos exceeds a critical threshold known as $M_{shock}$. Moreover, cold gas usually flows onto central galaxies through filamentary structures, currently referred to as cold streams. However, the evolution of cold streams in halos with masses around $M_{shock}$, particularly how they are disrupted, remains unclear. To address this issue, we conduct a set of idealised hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations show that (1) for a gas metallicity $Z=0.001-0.1Z_{\odot}$, cold stream with an inflow rate $\sim 3\, \rm{M_{\odot}}/yr$ per each can persist and effectively transport cold and cool gas to the central region ($&lt; 0.2$ virial radius) in halos with mass $10^{12}\, \rm{M_{\odot}}$, but is disrupted at a radius around $0.2$ virial radius due to compression heating for halos with mass $3 \times 10^{12}\, \rm{M_{\odot}}$. (2) At $z\sim 2$, the maximum halo mass that capable of hosting and sustaining cold streams $M_{stream}$ is between $1\times 10^{12} \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and $1.5\times 10^{12}\rm{M_{\odot}}$ for gas metallicity $Z=0.001Z_{\odot}$, while for a higher gas metallicity $Z=0.1Z_{\odot}$, this value increases to $\sim 1.5\times 10^{12}\rm{M_{\odot}}$. (3) The evolution and ultimate fate of cold streams are determined primarily by the rivalry between radiative cooling and compression. Stronger heating due to compression in halos more massive than $M_{stream}$ can surpass cooling and heat the gas in cold streams to the hot ($\geq 10^6\,$ K) phase.</description>

      <title>Limits on the OH Molecule in the Smith High Velocity Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for the OH molecule at several locations in the Smith Cloud, one of the most prominent of the high-velocity clouds that surround the Milky Way. Five positions with a high HI column density were selected as targets for individual pointings, along with a square degree around a molecular cloud detected with the Planck telescope near the tip of the Smith Cloud. Gas in the Galactic disk with similar values of $N_{HI}$ has detectable OH emission. Although we found OH at velocities consistent with the foreground Aquila molecular cloud, nothing was found at the velocity of the Smith Cloud to an rms level of 0.7 mK (T$_b$) in a 1 km $s^1$ channel. The three positions that give the strictest limits on OH are analyzed in detail. Their combined data imply a $5\sigma$ limit on $N(H_2) / N_{HI} \leq 0.03$ scaled by a factor dependent on the OH excitation temperature and background continuum $T_{ex}/(T_{ex}-T_{bg})$. There is no evidence for far-infrared emission from dust within the Smith Cloud. These results are consistent with expectations for a low-metallicity diffuse cloud exposed to the radiation field of the Galactic halo rather than a product of a galactic fountain.</description>

      <title>A too-many dwarf galaxy satellites problem in the M83 group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies in groups of galaxies provide excellent test cases for models of structure formation. This led to a so-called small-scale crisis, including the famous missing satellite and too-big-to-fail problems. It was suggested that these two problems are solved by the introduction of baryonic physics in cosmological simulations. We test for the nearby grand spiral M83 - a Milky Way sibling - whether its number of dwarf galaxy companions is compatible with today's $\Lambda$ + Cold Dark Matter model using two methods: with cosmological simulations that include baryons, as well as with theoretical predictions from the sub-halo mass function. By employing distance measurements we recover a list of confirmed dwarf galaxies within 330 kpc around M83 down to a magnitude of $M_V =-10$. We found that both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris-TNG50 and theoretical predictions agree with the number of confirmed satellites around M83 at the bright end of the luminosity function (&gt;10$^8$ solar masses) but underestimate it at the faint end (down to 10$^6$ solar masses) at more than 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ levels, respectively. This indicates a too-many satellites problem in $\Lambda$CDM for M83. The actual degree of tension to cosmological models is underestimated, because the number of observed satellites is incomplete due to the high contamination of spurious stars and galactic cirrus.</description>

      <title>Observational tests in scale invariance I: galaxy clusters and rotation of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy velocities in clusters, rotation curves of galaxies, and "vertical" oscillations in the Milky Way currently show too high velocities with respect to the masses thought to be involved. While these velocity excesses are currently interpreted as the consequence of dark matter, it can also be naturally explained as a consequence of scale invariant theory, which rests on a very simple first principle: the addition of a new fundamental symmetry. In the present work, the case of scale invariance, present in General Relativity and Maxwell equations for the empty space without charge and current, is considered. Cosmological models predict a rapid decrease of these effects with increasing mean density up to the critical density, where they totally disappear. Starting from the scale invariant geodesic equation by Dirac (1973), for which a demonstration by an action principle is presented, a modified Newton equation is derived. The solutions of this equation are applied to clusters of galaxies, galactic rotation at different redshifts and "vertical" motions in the Milky Way. In this new framework, the convergence of theoretical predictions and observations, in different gravitational systems, epochs, mass range and spatial scales, opens interesting perspectives that deserve to be explored further.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Feedback on Bi-stable ISM Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being energetically important, the effect of cosmic rays on the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is assumed to be negligible because the cosmic ray energy diffusion coefficient parallel to the magnetic field is relatively large. Using numerical simulations, we explore how variation of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient as a function of gas temperature could impact the dynamics of the ISM. We create a two-zone model of cosmic ray transport, reflecting the strong damping of the small scale magnetic field fluctuations, which scatter the cosmic rays, in a gas with low ionization. The variable diffusion coefficient allows more cold gas to form. However, setting the diffusion coefficient at a critical value in the warm phase allows the cosmic rays to adjust the kinetic energy cascade. Specifically, we show the slope of the cascade changes for motion perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, whereas kinetic energy parallel to the magnetic field is reduced equally across inertial scales. We show that cosmic ray energization (or reacceleration) comes at the expense of total radiated energy generated during the formation of a cold cloud. We also show that our two-zone model of cosmic ray transport is capable of matching estimates of the grammage for some paths through the simulation, but full comparison of the grammage requires simulating turbulence in a larger volume.</description>

      <title>The XMM Cluster Survey: Automating the estimation of hydrostatic mass for large samples of galaxy clusters I -- Methodology, Validation, &amp; Application to the SDSSRM-XCS sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe features of the X-ray: Generate and Analyse (XGA) open-source software package that have been developed to facilitate automated hydrostatic mass ($M_{\rm hydro}$) measurements from XMM X-ray observations of clusters of galaxies. This includes describing how XGA measures global, and radial, X-ray properties of galaxy clusters. We then demonstrate the reliability of XGA by comparing simple X-ray properties, namely the X-ray temperature and gas mass, with published values presented by the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS), the Ultimate XMM eXtragaLactic survey project (XXL), and the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS). XGA measured values for temperature are, on average, within 1% of the values reported in the literature for each sample. XGA gas masses for XXL clusters are shown to be ${\sim}$10% lower than previous measurements (though the difference is only significant at the $\sim$1.8$\sigma$ level), LoCuSS $R_{2500}$ and $R_{500}$ gas mass re-measurements are 3% and 7% lower respectively (representing a 1.5$\sigma$ and 3.5$\sigma$ difference). Like-for-like comparisons of hydrostatic mass are made to LoCuSS results, which show that our measurements are $10{\pm}3%$ ($19{\pm}7%$) higher for $R_{2500}$ ($R_{500}$). The comparison between $R_{500}$ masses shows significant scatter. Finally, we present new $M_{\rm hydro}$ measurements for 104 clusters from the SDSS DR8 redMaPPer XCS sample (SDSSRM-XCS). Our SDSSRM-XCS hydrostatic mass measurements are in good agreement with multiple literature estimates, and represent one of the largest samples of consistently measured hydrostatic masses. We have demonstrated that XGA is a powerful tool for X-ray analysis of clusters; it will render complex-to-measure X-ray properties accessible to non-specialists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yellow supergiants (YSGs) are rare and poorly understood, and studying them is critical to constraining massive star evolution. We obtained flux-calibrated Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) high-resolution spectra of 40 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); this sample likely contains post-red supergiants (RSGs). Fitting these data with ATLAS9 model atmospheres, we determined fundamental parameters for these stars. We measure the first spectroscopic luminosities for YSGs above 20 $M_\odot$, providing us a novel probe of the luminosity-to-mass ratio. Many stars in our sample appear to have anomalously high surface gravities, despite being confirmed LMC supergiants. We manually inspected our data finding evidence for binary companions and ongoing mass loss. Our work demonstrates the valuable role of high-resolution spectroscopy in interpreting the evolutionary status of cool supergiants.</description>

      <title>A forward-modelling approach to overcome PSF smearing and fit flexible models to the chemical structure of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, metallicity profiles of galaxies have been modelled using a radially symmetric, two-parameter linear model, which reveals that most galaxies are more metal-rich in their central regions than their outskirts. However, this model is known to yield inaccurate results when the point-spread function (PSF) of a telescope is large. Furthermore, a radially symmetric model cannot capture asymmetric structures within a galaxy. In this work, we present an extension of the popular forward-modelling python package LENSTRONOMY, which allows the user to overcome both of these obstacles. We demonstrate the new features of this code base through two illustrative examples on simulated data. First, we show that through forward modelling, LENSTRONOMY is able to recover accurately the metallicity gradients of galaxies, even when the PSF is comparable to the size of a galaxy, as long as the data is observed with a sufficient number of pixels. Additionally, we demonstrate how LENSTRONOMY is able to fit irregular metallicity profiles to galaxies that are not well-described by a simple surface brightness profile. This opens up pathways for detailed investigations into the connections between morphology and chemical structure for galaxies at cosmological distances using the transformative capabilities of JWST. Our code is publicly available and open source, and can also be used to model spatial distributions of other galaxy properties that are traced by its surface brightness profile.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of detecting shadows in disks induced by infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations performed with high-resolution imaging techniques revealed the existence of shadows in circumstellar disks that can be explained by the misalignment of an inner with respect to an outer disk. The cause of misalignment, however, is still debated. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of observing shadows induced by one prominent scenario that may lead to misalignment, which involves the late infall of material onto a protostellar system. In particular, we use previously performed hydrodynamical simulations of such events, and generate flux maps in the visible, near-infrared, submillimeter, and millimeter wavelength range using Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Based on that, we derive synthetic observations of these systems performed with the instruments SPHERE/VLT and ALMA, which we use as a basis for our subsequent analysis. We find that near-infrared observations with SPHERE are particularly well suited for detecting shadows via direct imaging alongside other features such as gaps, arcs, and streamers. On the contrary, performing a shadow detection based on reconstructed ALMA observations is very challenging due to the high sensitivity that is required for this task. Thus, in cases that allow for a detection, sophisticated analyses may be needed, for instance by the utilization of carefully constructed azimuthal profiles, aiding the search for potentially shallow shadows. Lastly, we conclude that late infall-induced disk misalignment offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of shadows that are observed in various systems.</description>

      <title>Metallicities for more than 10 million stars derived from Gaia BP/RP spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The third Gaia Data Release, which includes BP/RP spectra for 219 million sources, has opened a new window in the exploration of the chemical history and evolution of the Milky Way. The wealth of information encapsulated in these data is far greater than their low resolving power (R=50) at first glance would suggest, as shown in many studies. We zero in on the use of this data for the purpose of the detection of ''new'' metal-poor stars, which are hard to find yet essential for understanding - among other - several aspects of the origin of the Galaxy, star formation and the creation of the elements. Aims. We strive to refine a metal-poor candidate selection method which was developed with simulated Gaia BP/RP spectra, with an ultimate objective of providing the community with both a recipe to select stars for medium/high resolution observations and a catalogue of stellar metallicities. Methods. We used a datased comprised of GALAH DR3 and SAGA database stars in order to verify and adjust to real world data our selection method. For that purpose, we used dereddening as a mean to tackle the issue of extinction, and then we applied our fine-tuned method to select metal-poor candidates, which we thereafter observed and analysed. Results. We were able to infer metallicities for GALAH DR3 and SAGA stars - with color excesses up to E(B-V)&lt;1.5 - with an uncertainty of 0.36 dex, which is good enough for the purpose of identifying new metal-poor stars. Further, we selected 26 metal-poor candidates - via our method - for observations. As spectral analysis showed, 100% of them had [Fe/H]&lt;-2.0, 57% had [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 and 8% had [Fe/H]&lt;-3.0. We inferred metallicities for these stars with an uncertainty of 0.31 dex, as was proven when comparing to the spectroscopic [Fe/H]. Finally, we assembled a catalogue of metallicities for 10 861 062 stars.</description>

      <title>Galaxy dispersion measured by Fast Radio Bursts as a probe of baryonic feedback models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a sensitive probe of the electron distribution in both the large-scale structure and their host galaxies through the dispersion measure (DM) of the radio pulse. Baryonic feedback models are crucial for modelling small scales for ongoing cosmological surveys that are expected to change the electron distribution in galaxies in a way that can be probed by FRB observations. In this paper, we explore the impact of baryonic feedback on FRB hosts using numerical simulations and make a detailed study of the host galaxy dispersion as a function of redshift, galaxy type, feedback model and how these properties vary in independent simulation codes. We find that the host galaxy dispersion varies dramatically between different implementations of baryonic feedback, allowing FRBs with host identification to be a valuable probe of feedback physics and thus provide necessary priors for upcoming analysis of the statistical properties of the large-scale structure.
  We further find that any dependency on the exact location of events within the halo is small. While there exists an evolution of the dispersion measure with redshift and halo mass, it is largely driven by varying star formation rates of the halo. Spectral information from FRB hosts can therefore be used to put priors on the host galaxy dispersion measure, and FRBs can be used to distinguish between competing models of baryonic feedback in future studies.</description>

      <title>Clumpy Structures within the Turbulent Primordial Cloud</title>

Abstract: The primordial clouds in the mini-halos hatch the first generation stars of the universe, which play a crucial role in cosmic evolution. In this paper, we investigate how the turbulence impacts the structure of primordial star-forming cloud. Previous cosmological simulations of the first star formation predicted a typical mass of around $\mathrm{ 100 \, M_\odot}$, which conflicts with recent observations of extremely metal-poor stars suggesting a lower mass scale of around $\mathrm{25 \, M_\odot}$. The discrepancy may arise from unresolved turbulence in the star-forming cloud, driven by primordial gas accretion during mini-halo formation in the previous simulation. To quantitatively examine the turbulence effect on the primordial cloud formation, we employ the adaptive mesh refinement code $\mathtt{Enzo}$ to model the gas cloud with primordial composition, including artificial-driven turbulence on the cloud scale and relevant gas physics. This artificial-driven turbulence utilizes a stochastic forcing model to mimic the unresolved turbulence inside mini-halos. Our results show that turbulence with high Mach number and compressional mode effectively fragments the cloud into several clumps, each with dense cores of $\mathrm{22.7 - 174.9 \, M_\odot}$ that undergo Jeans instability to form stars. Fragmentation caused by intense and compressive turbulence prevents the runaway collapse of the cloud. The self-bound clumps with smaller masses in turbulent primordial cloud suggest a possible pathway to decrease the theoretical mass scale of first stars, further reconciling the mass discrepancy between simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Chain Chemistry in the Interstellar Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15769v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of carbon-chain molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) has been known since the early 1970s and $&gt;130$ such species have been identified to date, making up $\sim 43$% of the total of detected ISM molecules. They are prevalent not only in star-forming regions in our Galaxy but also in other galaxies. These molecules provide important information on physical conditions, gas dynamics, and evolutionary stages of star-forming regions. Larger species of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fullerenes (C$_{60}$ and C$_{70}$), which may be related to the formation of the carbon-chain molecules, have been detected in circumstellar envelopes around carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and planetary nebulae, while PAHs are also known to be a widespread component of the ISM in most galaxies. Recently, two line survey projects toward Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 with large single-dish telescopes have detected many new carbon-chain species, including molecules containing benzene rings. These new findings raise fresh questions about carbon-bearing species in the Universe. This article reviews various aspects of carbon-chain molecules, including observational studies, chemical simulations, quantum calculations, and laboratory experiments, and discusses open questions and how future facilities may answer them.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Indirect Estimators of Lyman Continuum Escape and their Application to High-Redshift JWST Galaxies</title>

Abstract: Reliable indirect diagnostics of LyC photon escape from galaxies are required to understand which sources were the dominant contributors to reionization. While multiple LyC escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}$) indicators have been proposed to trace favourable conditions for LyC leakage from the interstellar medium of low-redshift ''analog'' galaxies, it remains unclear whether these are applicable at high redshifts where LyC emission cannot be directly observed. Using a library of 14,120 mock spectra of star-forming galaxies with redshifts $4.64 \leq z \leq 10$ from the SPHINX$^{20}$ cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation, we develop a framework for the physics that leads to high $f_{\rm esc}$. We investigate LyC leakage from our galaxies based on the criteria that successful LyC escape diagnostics must i) track a high specific star formation rate, ii) be sensitive to stellar population age in the range $3.5-10~$Myr representing the times when supernova first explode to when LyC production significantly drops, and iii) include a proxy for neutral gas content and gas density in the interstellar medium. ${\rm O}_{32}$, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, M$_{\rm UV}$, and H$\beta$ equivalent width select for one or fewer of our criteria, rendering them either necessary but insufficient or generally poor diagnostics. In contrast, UV slope ($\beta$), and ${\rm E(B-V)}$ match two or more of our criteria, rendering them good $f_{\rm esc}$ diagnostics (albeit with significant scatter). Using our library, we build a quantitative model for predicting $f_{\rm esc}$ based on direct observables. When applied to bright $z &gt; 6$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters observed with JWST, we find that the majority of them have $f_{\rm esc} \lesssim 10\%$.</description>

      <title>Effects of Grain Magnetic Properties and Grain Growth on Synthetic Dust Polarization of MHD Simulations in Protostellar Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal dust polarization is a powerful tool to probe magnetic fields ($\textbf{B}$) and grain properties. However, a systematic study of the dependence of dust polarization on grain properties in protostellar environments is not yet available. In this paper, we post-process a non-ideal MHD simulation of a collapsing protostellar core with our updated POLARIS code to study in detail the effects of iron inclusions and grain growth on thermal dust polarization. We found that superparamagnetic (SPM) grains can produce high polarization degree of $p \sim 10-40\%$ beyond $\sim 500$ au from the protostar because of their efficient alignment by magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque mechanism. The magnetic field tangling by turbulence in the envelope causes the decrease in $p$ with increasing emission intensity $I$ as $p\propto I^{\alpha}$ with the slope $\alpha \sim -0.3$. But within 500 au, SPM grains tend to have inefficient internal alignment (IA) and be aligned with $\textbf{B}$ by RATs only, producing lower $p \sim 1\%$ and a steeper slope of $\alpha \sim -0.6$. For paramagnetic (PM) grains, the alignment loss of grains above $1\mu m$ in the inner $\sim 200$ au produces $p &lt;&lt; 1\%$ and the polarization hole with $\alpha \sim -0.9$. Grain growth can increase $p$ in the envelope for SPM grains, but cause stronger depolarization for SPM grains in the inner $\sim 500$ au and for PM grains in the entire protostellar core. Finally, we found the increase of polarization angle dispersion function $S$ with iron inclusions and grain growth, implying the dependence of B-field strength measured using the DCF technique on grain alignment and grain properties.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE: Resolving the End of Star Formation and Structure of AGN Accretion Disks from Cosmological Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently become possible to zoom-in from cosmological to sub-pc scales in galaxy simulations to follow accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, at some point the approximations used on ISM scales (e.g. optically-thin cooling and stellar-population-integrated star formation [SF] and feedback [FB]) break down. We therefore present the first cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation which self-consistently combines the FIRE physics (relevant on galactic/ISM scales where SF/FB are ensemble-averaged) and STARFORGE physics (relevant on small scales where we track individual (proto)stellar formation and evolution), together with explicit RMHD (including non-ideal MHD and multi-band M1-RHD) which self-consistently treats both optically-thick and thin regimes. This allows us to span scales from ~100 Mpc down to &lt;100 au (~300 Schwarzschild radii) around a SMBH at a time where it accretes as a bright quasar, in a single simulation. We show that accretion rates up to $\sim 10-100\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ can be sustained into the accretion disk at $\ll 10^{3}\,R_{\rm schw}$, with gravitational torques between stars and gas dominating on sub-kpc scales until star formation is shut down on sub-pc scales by a combination of optical depth to cooling and strong magnetic fields. There is an intermediate-scale, flux-frozen disk which is gravitoturbulent and stabilized by magnetic pressure sustaining strong turbulence and inflow with persistent spiral modes. In this paper we focus on how gas gets into the small-scale disk, and how star formation is efficiently suppressed.</description>

      <title>Two Distinct Classes of Quiescent Galaxies at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation at Cosmic Noon (1&lt;z&lt;3) from the JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER treasury surveys, which highlights two distinct classes of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously under-explored due to a lack of observing facilities with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution. We select a conservative sample of robust low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation rate criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous flattening of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation, which results from the separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct populations at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim10.3$: low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and have disky structures, and massive galaxies consistent with spheroidal morphologies and older median stellar ages. These separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental or feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar mass dependent slope of the quiescent size-mass relation could also indicate a shift from size growth due to star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations also corresponds with other dramatic changes and characteristic masses in several galaxy evolution scaling relations (e.g. star-formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-halo mass ratios), further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-mass and massive galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Binary black hole mergers and intermediate-mass black holes in dense star clusters with collisional runaways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are believed to be the missing link between the supermassive black holes (BHs) found at the centers of massive galaxies and BHs formed through stellar core collapse. One of the proposed mechanisms for their formation is a collisional runaway process in high-density young star clusters, where an unusually massive object forms through repeated stellar collisions and mergers, eventually collapsing to form an IMBH. This seed IMBH could then grow further through binary mergers with other stellar-mass BHs. Here we investigate the gravitational-wave (GW) signals produced during these later IMBH--BH mergers. We use a state-of-the-art semi-analytic approach to study the stellar dynamics and to characterize the rates and properties of IMBH--BH mergers. We also study the prospects for detection of these mergers by current and future GW observatories, both space-based (LISA) and ground-based (LIGO Voyager, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer). We find that most of the merger signals could be detected, with some of them being multi-band sources. Therefore, GWs represent a unique tool to test the collisional runaway scenario and to constrain the population of dynamically assembled IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Where do they come from? Identification of globular cluster escaped stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs), as old as our Galaxy, constantly lose their members to the field as they cross through the Milky Way (MW). These GC escaped stars (or escapees) are suggested to contribute significantly to the MW halo. If a star has left the host GC a long time ago, chemical finger prints, e.g., N enrichment, may reveal its origin. In this work, we aim to establish dynamical connections between N-rich field stars recently identified by LAMOST and the existing MW GCs. By constructing the full action distribution, and combining with metallicity, we found 29 potential GC progenitors for 15 N-rich field stars. Particularly, some of them may be related to MW accretion events. On the other hand, if a star recently left its host GC via tidal evaporation, it still maintain the kinematic properties of the cluster. Here we identify extra-tidal candidates based on their spatial locations, proper motions (PMs), and their position on color-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs). We successfully identified more than 1600 extra-tidal candidates in the vicinity of six Gaia-Enceladus (GE)-related GCs (i.e., NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 6205, NGC 6341, NGC 6779, NGC 7089). The density map of the extra-tidal candidates is confirmed to be an efficient way to find extra-tidal structures. The possible two density peaks at opposite directions of the inner boundary is a good indicator for long stellar stream. Among 95 extra-tidal candidates with spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicity, 54 of them are confirmed to be GC escaped stars, as they share similar properties as host GCs. These extra-tidal candidates are ideal targets for follow-up spectroscopic observation, as it greatly improves the scientific outcome. Once statistically significant number of spectroscopic radial velocities and metallicities are available, the GC dynamical evolution (e.g., mass loss, rotation) can be carefully investigated.</description>

      <title>CON-quest II. Spatially and spectrally resolved HCN/HCO+ line ratios in local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear regions of ultraluminous and luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) are powered by starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These regions are often obscured by extremely high columns of gas and dust. Molecular lines in the submillimeter windows have the potential to determine the physical conditions of these compact obscured nuclei (CONs). We aim to reveal the distributions of HCN and HCO$^+$ emission in local U/LIRGs and investigate whether and how they are related to galaxy properties. Using ALMA, we have conducted sensitive observations of the HCN J=3--2 and HCO$^+$ J=3--2 lines toward 23 U/LIRGs in the local Universe (z &lt; 0.07) with a spatial resolution of ~0.3" (~50--400 pc). We detected both HCN and HCO$^+$ in 21 galaxies, only HCN in one galaxy, and neither in one galaxy. The global HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratios, averaged over scales of ~0.5--4 kpc, range from 0.4 to 2.3, with an unweighted mean of 1.1. These line ratios appear to have no systematic trend with bolometric AGN luminosity or star formation rate. The line ratio varies with position and velocity within each galaxy, with an average interquartile range of 0.38 on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis. In eight out of ten galaxies known to have outflows and/or inflows, we found spatially and kinematically symmetric structures of high line ratios. These structures appear as a collimated bicone in two galaxies and as a thin spherical shell in six galaxies. Non-LTE analysis suggests that the high HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio in outflows is predominantly influenced by the abundance ratio. Chemical model calculations indicate that the enhancement of HCN abundance in outflows is likely due to high-temperature chemistry triggered by shock heating. These results imply that the HCN/HCO$^+$ line ratio can aid in identifying the outflow geometry when the shock velocity of the outflows is sufficiently high to heat the gas.</description>

      <title>Galaxies in the zone of avoidance: Misclassifications using machine learning tools</title>

Abstract: Automated methods for classifying extragalactic objects in large surveys offer significant advantages compared to manual approaches in terms of efficiency and consistency. However, the existence of the Galactic disk raises additional concerns. These regions are known for high levels of interstellar extinction, star crowding, and limited data sets and studies. In this study, we explore the identification and classification of galaxies in the zone of avoidance (ZoA). In particular, we compare our results in the near-infrared (NIR) with X-ray data. We analyzed the appearance of objects in the Galactic disk classified as galaxies using a published machine-learning (ML) algorithm and make a comparison with the visually confirmed galaxies from the VVV NIRGC catalog. Our analysis, which includes the visual inspection of all sources cataloged as galaxies throughout the Galactic disk using ML techniques reveals significant differences. Only four galaxies were found in both the NIR and X-ray data sets. Several specific regions of interest within the ZoA exhibit a high probability of being galaxies in X-ray data but closely resemble extended Galactic objects. Our results indicate the difficulty in using ML methods for galaxy classification in the ZoA, which is mainly due to the scarcity of information on galaxies behind the Galactic plane in the training set. They also highlight the importance of considering specific factors that are present to improve the reliability and accuracy of future studies in this challenging region.</description>

To this purpose, we build up a semi-empirical model for the reionization history of the Universe, based on various ingredients: the latest determination of the UV galaxy luminosity function from JWST out to redshift $z\lesssim 12$; data-inferred and simulation-driven assumptions on the redshift-dependent escape fraction of ionizing photons from primordial galaxies; a simple yet flexible parameterization of the IMF $\phi(m_\star)\sim m_\star^\xi\, e^{-m_{\star,\rm c}/m_\star}$ in terms of a high-mass end slope $\xi&lt;0$ and of a characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}$ below which a flattening or a bending sets in; the PARSEC stellar evolution code to compute the UV and ionizing emission from different star's masses as a function of age and metallicity; a few physical constraints related to stellar and galaxy formation in faint galaxies at the reionization redshifts. We compare our model outcomes with the reionization observables from different astrophysical and cosmological probes, and perform Bayesian inference on the IMF parameters. We find that the IMF slope $\xi$ is within the range from $-2.8$ to $-2.3$, while appreciably flatter slopes are excluded at great significance. However, the bestfit value of the IMF characteristic mass $m_{\star,\rm c}\sim$ a few $M_\odot$ implies a suppression in the formation of small stellar masses, at variance with the IMF in the local Universe; this may be induced by the thermal background $\sim 20-30$ K provided by CMB photons at the reionization redshifts. Finally, we investigate the implications of our reconstructed IMF on the recent JWST detections of massive galaxies at and beyond the reionization epoch, showing that any putative tension with the standard cosmological framework is substantially alleviated.</description>

Abstract: In this review (the third in the series focused on a small two-band UV-photometry mission), we assess possibilities for a small UV two-band photometry mission in studying accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; mass range $\sim 10^6$-$10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$). We focus on the following observational concepts: (i) dedicated monitoring of selected type-I Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in order to measure the time delay between the far-UV, the near-UV, and other wavebands (X-ray and optical), (ii) nuclear transients including (partial) tidal disruption events and repetitive nuclear transients, and (iii) the study of peculiar sources, such as changing-look AGN, hollows and gaps in accretion disks, low-luminosity AGN, and candidates for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs; mass range $\sim 10^2$-$10^5\,M_{\odot}$) in galactic nuclei. For tidal disruption events (TDEs), high-cadence UV monitoring is crucial for distinguishing among different scenarios for the origin of the UV emission. The small two-band UV space telescope will also provide the information about the near- and far-UV continuum variability for rare transients, such as repetitive partial TDEs and jetted TDEs. We also discuss the possibilities to study and analyze sources with non-standard accretion flows, such as AGN with gappy disks, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with intermittent accretion, and SMBH binaries potentially involving intermediate-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model For Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04507</link>

Abstract: Recent numerical cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical-star formation simulations have resolved the formation of quasar accretion disks with Eddington or super-Eddington accretion rates onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) down to a few hundred gravitational radii. These 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks appear to be qualitatively distinct from classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks: the midplane pressure is dominated by toroidal magnetic fields with plasma $\beta \ll 1$ powered by advection of magnetic flux from the interstellar medium (ISM), and they are super-sonically and trans-Alfvenically turbulent with cooling times short compared to dynamical times yet remain gravitationally stable owing to magnetic support. In this paper, we present a simple analytic similarity model for such disks. For reasonable assumptions, the model is entirely specified by the boundary conditions (inflow rate at the BH radius of influence [BHROI]). We show that the scalings from this model are robust to various detailed assumptions, agree remarkably well with the simulations (given their simplicity), and demonstrate the self-consistency and gravitational stability of such disks even in the outer accretion disk (approaching the BHROI) at hyper-Eddington accretion rates.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of wide Jupiter Mass Binary Objects in young stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently observed population of 540 free-floating Jupiter-mass objects, including 40 dynamically soft pairs in the Trapezium cluster have raised interesting questions on their formation and evolution. We test various scenarios for the origin and survivability of these free floating Jupiter-mass objects and Jupiter-mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) in the Trapezium cluster. The numerical calculations are performed by direct N-body integration of the stars and planets in the Trapezium cluster starting with a wide variety of planets in various configurations. We discuss four models: SPP, in which selected stars have two outer orbiting Jupiter-mass planets; SPM, where selected stars are orbited by Jupiter-mass planet-moon pairs; ISF in which JuMBOs form in situ with the stars, and FFC, where we introduce a population of free-floating single Jupiter-mass objects, but no initialized binaries. Models FFC and SPP fail to produce enough JuMBOs. Models SPM can produce sufficient JuMBOs, but requires unusually wide orbits for the planet-moon system around the star. The observed JuMBOs and free-floating Jupiter-mass objects in the Trapezium cluster are best reproduced if they formed in pairs and as free-floaters together with the other stars in a smooth (Plummer) density profile with a virial radius of 0.5pc. A fractal stellar distribution also works, but requires relatively recent formations (&gt;0.2Myr after the other stars formed) or a high (50%) initial binary fraction. This would make the primordial binary fraction of JuMBOs even higher than the already large observation fraction of 8%. The fraction of JuMBOs will continue to drop with time, and the lack of JuMBOs in Upper Scorpius could then result in its higher age, causing more JuMBOs to be ionized. We then also predict that the interstellar density of Jupiter-mass objects (mostly singles with 2% lucky surviving binaries) is 0.05/pc$^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Outflows Driven from a Magnetic Pseudodisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows play a pivotal role in star formation as one of its most visible markers and a means of transporting mass, momentum, and angular momentum from the infalling gas into the surrounding molecular cloud. Their wide reach (at least thousands of au) is a contrast to typical disk sizes ($\sim 10-100$ au). We employ high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study outflow properties in the Class 0 phase. We find that no disk wind is driven from the extended centrifugal disk that has weak magnetic coupling. The low-velocity winds emerge instead from the infalling magnetic pseudodisk. Much of the disk actually experiences an infall of matter rather than outflowing gas. Some of the pseudodisk wind (PD-wind) moves inward to regions above the disk and either falls onto the disk or proceeds upward. The upward flow gives the impression of a disk wind above a certain height even if the gas is originally emerging from the pseudodisk. The PD-wind has the strongest flow coming from a disk interaction zone that lies just outside the disk and is an interface between the inwardly advected magnetic field of the pseudodisk and the outwardly diffusing magnetic field of the disk. The low-velocity wind exhibits the features of a flow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force in some regions and those of a magnetocentrifugal wind in other regions. We interpret the structure and dynamics of the outflow zone in terms of the basic physics of gravity, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and nonideal MHD.</description>
