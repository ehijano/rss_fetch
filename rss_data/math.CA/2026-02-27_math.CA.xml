      <title>Three-Term Recurrence Relations for Confluent Basic Hypergeometric Series with Applications to q-Bessel Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish three-term recurrence relations for the ${}_1\phi_1$ and ${}_0\phi_1$ basic hypergeometric series involving multiplicative shifts of the parameters and the variable by integer powers of q. The coefficients of these recurrence relations are shown to be uniquely determined by the shift indices and are given explicitly in terms of rational functions. These recurrence relations arise as confluent limits of previously established recurrence relations for the ${}_2\phi_1$ basic hypergeometric series.
  As an application, we derive three-term recurrence relations for Jackson's second and third q-Bessel functions. These recurrence relations involve additive shifts in the order and multiplicative q-shifts in the variable, and their coefficients include the known q-Lommel polynomials as special cases.</description>

      <title>Repeated principal indefinite summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under suitable asymptotic and convexity conditions on a function $g\colon\mathbb{R}_+\to\mathbb{R}$, the solution to $\Delta f=g$, where $\Delta$ is the forward difference operator, is unique up to an additive constant and is called the principal indefinite sum of $g$, generalizing the additive form of Bohr-Mollerup's theorem. We consider the map $\Sigma$, which assigns to each admissible function $g$ its principal indefinite sum that vanishes at $1$, and we naturally explore its iterates, which produce repeated principal indefinite sums, in analogy with the concept of repeated indefinite integrals. Explicit formulas and convergence results are established, highlighting connections with classical combinatorial and special functions, including the multiple gamma functions, for which we also provide integral representations.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Laplace asymptotics up to the concentration threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional Laplace-type integrals of the form $I(\lambda):=\int_{\mathbb R^d} g(x)e^{-\lambda f(x)}dx$ in the regime where $d$ and $\lambda$ are both large. Until now, rigorous bounds for Laplace expansions in growing dimension have been restricted to the "Gaussian-approximation" regime, known to hold when $d^2/\lambda\to0$. This excludes many practically relevant regimes, including those arising in physics and modern high-dimensional statistics, which operate beyond this threshold while still satisfying the concentration condition $d/\lambda\to0$. Here, we close this gap. We develop an explicit asymptotic expansion for $\log I(\lambda)$ with quantitative remainder bounds that remain valid throughout this intermediate region, arbitrarily close to the concentration threshold $d/\lambda\to0$.
  Fix any $L\ge1$ and suppose $g(0)=1$. Assume that, in a neighborhood of the minimizer of $f$, the operator norms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are bounded independently of $d$ and $\lambda$ through orders $2(L+1)$ and $2L$, respectively. Assuming also some mild global growth conditions on $f$ and $g$, we prove that $$ \log I(\lambda)=\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} b_k(f,g)\lambda^{-k}+O(d^{L+1}/\lambda^L),\quad d^{L+1}/\lambda^L\to0, $$ and that the coefficients satisfy $b_k(f,g)= O(d^{k+1})$. Moreover, the coefficients $b_k(f,g)$ coincide with those arising from the formal cumulant-based expansion of $\log I(\lambda)$.
  The proof is constructive and proceeds via explicit polynomial changes of variables that iteratively "quadratize" the exponent while controlling Jacobian effects, thereby avoiding heavy Gaussian concentration machinery. We illustrate the expansion on two representative examples.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the integral representations of solutions to the variant of $q$-hypergeometric equation of degree 2 obtained through $q$-middle convolution by using transformation formulas for $q$-hypergeometric series. We show the correspondence between these integral solutions and solutions obtained by other methods. We also show the linear relationships among the integral solutions.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic Kernels and Energy Minimizing Measures, with Applications to the Flat Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimization of the energy integral $I_K(\mu) = \int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} K(x,y) d\mu(x) d\mu(y)$ over all Borel probability measures $\mu$, where $(\Omega,\rho)$ is a compact connected metric space and $K:\Omega^2 \to [0,\infty]$ is continuous in the extended sense. We focus on kernels $K$ which are subharmonic, which we define so that the potential $U_K^\mu(x) = \int_{\Omega} K(x,y) d\mu(y)$ satisfies a maximum principle on $\Omega\setminus{\rm supp}{\mu}$. This extends the classical electrostatics minimization problem for logarithmic energy $\int_{\Omega}\int_{\Omega}\log\left(\frac{1}{||x-y||}\right)$, which is used heavily as a tool in approximation theory. Using properties of minimizing measures, we show that if the singularities of the subharmonic kernel $K$ are such that $K$ is regular, then $K$ is positive definite, and $\mu$ is a minimizing measure if and only if its potential is constant (outside of a small exceptional set).We then apply this result to group invariant kernels on compact homogeneous manifolds. In this case, the uniform measure $\sigma$ has constant potential, so subharmonicity implies that this is the minimizing measure. Finally, we look at the case of the $d$-dimensional flat torus $T^d$. We use our results to see that the Riesz kernel $K_s(x,y) = {\rm sign}(s)\rho(x,y)^{-s}$ is minimized by $\sigma$ (and thus positive definite) when $d &gt; s \geq d-2$. Additionally, the positive definiteness gives us a condition which implies that the multivariate Fourier series of a function $f:[0,\pi]^d \to [0,\infty]$ has nonnegative coefficients.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Lavrentiev Phenomenon in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify and extend insights from Lavrentiev's seminal paper. We examine the original theorem dealing with the absence of the Lavrentiev phenomenon, a cornerstone issue in the calculus of variations. We point out some inconsistencies in the original proof by providing a counterexample and supply the result with a new, concise, and complete reasoning. In the appendix, we also provide additional details to supplement the original proof.</description>

      <title>Transformations and summations for bilateral basic hypergeometric series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review and derive transformation and summation formulas for bilateral basic hypergeometric series. Our study focuses on consequences of certain bilateral extensions of two important results by Bailey, namely a transformation for very-well-poised $_8W_7$ series in terms of two balanced $_4\phi_3$ series, and a transformation connecting three $_8W_7$ series. Two rather recently discovered transformations of bilateral basic very-well-poised ${}_8\Psi_8$, one by Zhang and Zhang, the other by Wei and Yu, serve as the starting point of our investigations. From these transformations we work out interesting special cases that were not considered before, including explicit bilateral quadratic and cubic summations. We further explicitly record noteworthy lower-level transformations derived by taking suitable limits and deduce more transformations by exploiting the symmetry of the parameters in the series.</description>

      <title>Polynomially effective equidistribution for certain unipotent subgroups in quotients of perfect Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of certain unipotent subgroups in arithmetic quotients of perfect Lie groups with a polynomial error term. Even for semisimple quotients, our result provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution with polynomial error rate is obtained for non-horospherical unipotent subgroups.
  The proof is based on the spectral gap of the ambient space, an effective closing lemma, Bourgain's discretized projection theorem, and a sub-modularity inequality in irreducible representation. The sub-modularity inequality is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest.
  As applications, we obtain effective estimates on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Discrete equations from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper discrete equations are derived from B\"{a}cklund transformations of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, including a new discrete equation which has ternary symmetry. There are two classes of rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation, one expressed in terms of the generalised Laguerre polynomials and the other in terms of the generalised Umemura polynomials, both of which can be expressed as Wronskians of Laguerre polynomials. Hierarchies of rational solutions of the discrete equations are derived in terms of the generalised Laguerre and generalised Umemura polynomials. It is known that there is nonuniqueness of some rational solutions of the fifth Painlev\'{e} equation. Pairs of nonunique rational solutions are used to derive distinct hierarchies of rational solutions which satisfy the same discrete equation.</description>

      <title>A new product formula for $(z;q)_\infty$, with applications to asymptotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express the $q$-Pochhammer symbol $(z;q)_\infty$ as an infinite product of gamma functions, analogously to how Narukawa expressed the elliptic gamma function as an infinite product of hyperbolic gamma functions. This identity is used to obtain asymptotic expansions when $q$ tends to $1$.</description>
