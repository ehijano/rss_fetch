      <title>Image-based modelling of elastic properties using unresolved rock images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade-off between image resolution and model field-of-view has long been a limitation for numerical simulations in digital rock models. A significant amount of sub-resolution pore space cannot be captured in the unresolved digital rock images, which hinders the accuracy of numerical simulations, especially those predicting the rock effective elastic properties. This work uses paired digital rock images at multiple resolutions to investigate the sub-resolution solid and pore fraction distributions. It demonstrates that the cumulative Beta distribution function can effectively represent the solid and pore fractions in unresolved rock images. Based on this finding, we propose a novel methodology to predict the sub-resolution pore fractions. Compared to the pore fractions extracted from paired Bentheimer sandstone images at resolutions of 2, 6, and 18um, the proposed method yields double-weighted mean absolute percentage errors (WWMAPE) of 3.67% (6um) and 13.78% (18um), significantly lower than the SLOT technique's errors of 24.55% (6um) and 59.33% (18um). By incorporating the modelled solid and pore fractions with effective medium theory, this work achieves improved predictions of effective elastic moduli and wave velocities across various rock types. This method has significant implications for conducting enhanced simulations of geophysical properties in unresolved rock models.</description>

      <title>Traveltime signature of 3-D edge diffractions exemplified by triple-square-root moveout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various underground anomalies, both natural and artificial, cause diffraction of high-frequency seismic and electromagnetic pulses emitted from the earth's surface. Backscattered, they are registered by seismic sensors and ground-penetrating radars. Most of these signals can be categorized as either point or edge diffraction. Despite the abundance of linear structures in geological formations and among buried anthropogenic objects, diffraction processing often relies on the idea of point diffraction. However, 3-D edge diffractions have unique properties that need to be exploited. We show that the mixed source-receiver traveltime derivatives, available from data, identify edge diffractions at arbitrary offsets. Additionally, they constitute a system of ordinary differential equations describing finite-offset focusing curves on the acquisition surface. Such curves enable sorting of the data into fragments that focus on specific points on the edge. To confirm and demonstrate these properties, we derive an exact traveltime formula for a straight diffractor in a homogeneous medium. We refer to it as the triple-square-root moveout in analogy to the double-square-root moveout of 2-D diffractions. Since it represents a potentially useful approximation, we compare it with standard moveouts and wave modeling.</description>

      <title>Distributed acoustic sensing for ocean applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields, including biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an evolving technique for continuous, wide-coverage measurements of mechanical vibrations, which is suited to ocean applications. DAS illuminates an optical fiber with laser pulses and measures the backscattered wave due to small random variations in the refractive index of the material. External stimuli, such as mechanical strain due to acoustic wavefields impinging on the fiber-optic cable, modulate the backscattered wave. Continuous measurement of the backscattered signal provides a distributed sensing modality of the impinging wavefield. Considering the potential use of existing telecommunication fiber-optic cables deployed across the oceans, DAS has emerged as a promising technology for monitoring the underwater soundscape. This review presents advances in DAS in the last decade and details the underlying physics from electromagnetic to mechanical and eventually acoustic quantities. To guide the use of DAS for ocean applications, the effect of DAS acquisition parameters in signal processing is explained. Finally, DAS is demonstrated on data from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array for the detection of sound sources, such as whales, ships, and earthquakes.</description>
