      <title>Star exponentials from propagators and path integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the relation between the star exponentials emerging within the Deformation Quantization formalism and Feynman's path integrals associated with propagators in quantum dynamics. In order to obtain such a relation, we start by visualizing the quantum propagator as an integral transform of the star exponential by means of the symbol corresponding to the time evolution operator and, thus, we introduce Feynman's path integral representation of the propagator as a sum over all the classical histories. The star exponential thus constructed has the advantage that it does not depend on the convergence of formal series, as commonly understood within the context of Deformation Quantization. We include some basic examples to illustrate our findings, recovering standard results reported in the literature. Further, for an arbitrary finite dimensional system, we use the star exponential introduced here in order to find a particular representation of the star product which resembles the one encountered in the context of the quantum field theory for a Poisson sigma model.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Magnetism, Symmetries and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Equivariant Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel lemma in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This lemma generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

      <title>The Hessian geometry of the ideal gas in rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hessian geometry associated with an ideal gas in a spherical centrifuge. According to Souriau, a spherically confined ideal gas admit states of thermal and rotational equilibrium. These states, called Gibbs states, form an exponential family with an action of the Euclidean rotation group. We investigate its Hessian (Fisher-Rao) geometry and show that in the high angular velocity limit, the geometry can be compared to the Hessian geometry of a spherical rigid body which we show to be isometric to a hyperbolic space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first we revisit the formal integration of Lie algebras, which give rise to braces in some special cases. Then we establish the formal integration theory for complete Rota-Baxter Lie algebras, that is, we show that there is a Rota-Baxter group with the underlying group structure given by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, associated to any complete Rota-Baxter Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Deriving a GENERIC system from a Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the fundamental problem of coarse-graining infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics to obtain a macroscopic system which includes dissipative mechanisms. In particular, we study the thermodynamical implications concerning Hamiltonians, energy, and entropy and the induced geometric structures such as Poisson and Onsager brackets (symplectic and dissipative brackets).
  We start from a general finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system that is coupled linearly to an infinite-dimensional heat bath with linear dynamics. The latter is assumed to admit a compression to a finite-dimensional dissipative semigroup (i.e., the heat bath is a dilation of the semigroup) describing the dissipative evolution of new macroscopic variables.
  Already in the finite-energy case (zero-temperature heat bath) we obtain the so-called GENERIC structure (General Equations for Non-Equilibrium Reversible Irreversibe Coupling), with conserved energy, nondecreasing entropy, a new Poisson structure, and an Onsager operator describing the dissipation. However, their origin is not obvious at this stage. After extending the system in a natural way to the case of positive temperature, giving a heat bath with infinite energy, the compression property leads to an exact multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that drives the rest of the system. Thus, we are able to identify a conserved energy, an entropy, and an Onsager operator (involving the Green-Kubo formalism) which indeed provide a GENERIC structure for the macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>Gluing algebraic quantum field theories on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been observed that, given an algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) on a manifold $M$ and an open cover $\{M_\alpha\}$ of $M$, it is typically not possible to recover the global algebra of observables on $M$ by simply gluing the underlying local algebras subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$. Instead of gluing local algebras, we introduce a gluing construction of AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ and we show that for simple examples of AQFTs, constructed out for geometric data, gluing the local AQFTs subordinate to $\{M_\alpha\}$ recovers the global AQFT on $M$. This result implies that the local AQFTs contain more information than the local algebras.</description>

      <title>Representations of Multiparameter Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct representations of the quantum algebras ~$U_{q{\bf q}}(gl(n))$ and ~$U_{q{\bf q}}(sl(n))$~ which are in duality with the multiparameter quantum groups ~$GL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$, ~$SL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$,~ respectively. These objects depend on ~$n(n-1)/2+1$~ deformation parameters ~$q,q_{ij}$ ($1\leq i &lt;j\leq n$) which is the maximal possible number in the case of $GL(n)$. The representations are labelled by $n-1$ complex numbers ~$r_i$~ and are acting in the space of formal power series of ~$n(n-1)/2$~ non-commuting variables. These variables generate quantum flag manifolds of ~$GL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$, ~$SL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$. The case $n=3$ is treated in more detail.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequality for the 2D Pauli operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the Aharonov-Casher theorem, the Pauli operator $P$ has no zero eigenvalue when the normalized magnetic flux $\alpha$ satisfies $|\alpha|&lt;1$, but it does have a zero energy resonance. We prove that in this case a Lieb-Thirring inequality for the $\gamma$-th moment of the eigenvalues of $P+V$ is valid under the optimal restrictions $\gamma\geq |\alpha|$ and $\gamma&gt;0$. Besides the usual semiclassical integral, the right side of our inequality involves an integral where the zero energy resonance state appears explicitly. Our inequality improves earlier works that were restricted to moments of order $\gamma\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Field method approach in the factorization of nonlinear second order differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the general solution of second-order nonlinear differential equations of Lienard type is obtained within the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-Perez by the so-called field method approach. This method is based on writing the factorization conditions in the dynamical systems form and requires to assume that the intermediate function Phi that occurs in the factorization be dependent not only on the dependent variable of the nonlinear equation, but also on the independent variable. The method is applied to several cases of Lienard type equations which are written in a commutative factorization form and their general solutions are obtained by solving Bernoulli differential equations.</description>

      <title>A fully implicit, asymptotic-preserving, semi-Lagrangian algorithm for the time dependent anisotropic heat transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the operator-split asymptotic-preserving, semi-Lagrangian algorithm for time dependent anisotropic heat transport equation proposed in [Chac\'on et al., JCP, 272, 719-746, 2014] to use a fully implicit time integration with backward differentiation formulas. The proposed implicit method can deal with arbitrary heat-transport anisotropy ratios \chi_{\parallel}/\chi_{\perp}\ggg1 (with \chi_{\parallel}, \chi_{\perp} the parallel and perpendicular heat diffusivities, respectively) in complicated magnetic field topologies in an accurate and efficient manner. The implicit algorithm is second-order accurate temporally, has favorable positivity preservation properties, and demonstrates an accurate treatment at boundary layers (e.g., island separatrices), which was not ensured by the operator-split implementation. The condition number of the resulting algebraic system is independent of the anisotropy ratio, and is inverted with preconditioned GMRES. We propose a simple preconditioner that renders the linear system compact, resulting in mesh-independent convergence rates for topologically simple magnetic fields, and convergence rates scaling as \sim(N\Delta t)^{1/4} (with N the total mesh size and \Delta t the timestep) in topologically complex magnetic-field configurations. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the approach with test problems of varying complexity, including an analytically tractable boundary-layer problem in a straight magnetic field, and a topologically complex magnetic field featuring magnetic islands with extreme anisotropy ratios (\chi_{\parallel}/\chi_{\perp}=10^{10}).</description>

      <title>Central Configurations with Dihedral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an application of the representation theory for the dihedral groups, we study the symmetric central configurations in the n-body problem where $n$ equal masses are placed at the vertices of a regular $n$-gon. Since the Hessian matrices at these configurations are typically very large, particularly when $n$ is large, computations of their eigenvalues present a challenging problem. However, by decomposing the action of the dihedral groups into irreducible representations, we show that the Hessians can be simplified to a block-diagonal matrix with small blocks, of the sizes at most 2*2. This is due to the fact that the action of a dihedral group can be represented as a block-diagonal matrix with small irreducible blocks. In the end, the eigenvalues can be explicitly obtained by simply computing eigenvalues of these small block matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries have emerged as a tool for developing viable and physically coherent models, particularly in scenarios incorporating a negative cosmological constant. This study demonstrates that when the bulk geometry accommodates a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which operate on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (be they spacelike or timelike), it leads to the existence of two distinct families of five-dimensional spacetimes. These spacetimes represent the general solutions to the bulk field equations. An aspect of these models is the composition of their energy-momentum tensor, which includes two key components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. This framework can be perceived as a $5D$ extension of the recently identified Spatially Inhomogeneous and Irrotational spacetimes. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the Randall-Sundrum theory. This exploration is essential for deepening our understanding of the role of higher dimensions in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic scalar product in spatially-bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physically interesting quantities of the electromagnetic field can be computed using the electromagnetic scalar product. However, none of the existing expressions for such scalar product are directly applicable when the fields are only known in a spatially-bounded domain, as is the case for many numerical Maxwell solvers. In here, we derive an expression for the electromagnetic scalar product between radiation fields that only involves integrals over closed spatial surfaces. The expression readily leads to formulas for the number of photons, energy, and helicity of generic polychromatic light pulses of incoming or outgoing character. The capabilities of popular Maxwell solvers in spatially-bounded computational domains are thereby augmented, for example, by a straightforward method for normalizing emitted fields so that they contain a single photon.</description>

      <title>The Physisorbate-Layer Problem Arising in Kinetic Theory of Gas-Surface Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A half-space problem of a linear kinetic equation for gas molecules physisorbed close to a solid surface, relevant to a kinetic model of gas-surface interactions and derived by Aoki et al. [K.~Aoki et al., in: Phys. Rev. E 106:035306, 2022], is considered. The equation contains a confinement potential in the vicinity of the solid surface and an interaction term between gas molecules and phonons. It is proved that a unique solution exists when the incoming molecular flux is specified at infinity. This validates the natural observation that the half-space problem serves as the boundary condition for the Boltzmann equation. It is also proved that the sequence of approximate solutions used for the existence proof converges exponentially fast. In addition, numerical results showing the details of the solution to the half-space problem are presented.</description>

Abstract: Consider the generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equations with power nonlinearities $q=2,3,4\ldots$ in dimension $N=1$, and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) model with integer power nonlinearities $q$ in higher dimensions $N\geq 2$. Among these power-type models, the only conjectured equation with space localized time periodic breathers is the modified KdV (mKdV), corresponding to the case $q=3$ and $N=1$. Quasimonochromatic solutions were introduced by Mandel to show that sine-Gordon is the only scalar field model with breather solutions among this class. In this paper we consider smooth generalized quasimonochromatic solutions of arbitrary size for gKdV and ZK models and provide a rigorous proof that mKdV is the unique power-like model among them with spatially localized breathers of this type. In particular, we show the nonexistence of breathers of this class in the ZK models. The method of proof involves the use of the naturally coherent algebra of Bell's polynomials to obtain particularly distinctive structural elliptic PDEs satisfied by breather-like quasimonochromatic solutions. A reduction of the problem to the classification of solutions of these elliptic PDEs in the entire space is performed, and de Giorgi type uniqueness results are proved in this particular case, concluding the uniqueness of the mKdV breather, and the nonexistence of localized smooth breathers in the ZK case. No assumption on well-posedness is made, and the power of the nonlinearity is arbitrary.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with quantum transport in open quantum graphs. We consider the case of complete graphs on $n$ vertices with an edge removed and attached to two leads, to represent the entrance and exit channels, from where we calculate the transmission coefficient. We include the possibility of several vertices being connected or not and associate it with a randomization parameter $p$. To implement the calculation, we had to introduce the transmission coefficient of randomized quantum graphs (RQG), and we also proposed a procedure to obtain the exact and approximate but reliable results for such transmission coefficients. The main results show that the transport is importantly affected by the removal of connections between pairs of vertices, but they also indicate the presence of a region where the transmission is fully suppressed, even when the number of edge removal is not too small.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CKP tau function has been an important topic in mathematical physics. In this paper, the inverse of vacuum expectation value of exponential of certain bosonic fields, is showed to be the CKP tau function given by Chang and Wu, in the language of CKP Darboux transformation. In fact, computation of the above vacuum expectation value is usually quite difficult, since the square of bosonic fields is usually not zero. Here the corresponding vacuum expectation value is understood as successive application of CKP Darboux transformations, so that we can compute it by using the methods of integrable systems, where a useful formula is given. For applications, we construct solutions of KdV hierarchy by vacuum expectation value of bosonic fields, by the fact that KdV hierarchy is the 2-reduction of CKP hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the condensation phenomenon for the invariant measures of the mean-field model of reversible coagulation-fragmentation processes conditioned to a supercritical density of particles. It is shown that when the parameters of the associated balance equation satisfy a subexponential tail condition, there is one single giant particle that corresponds to the missing mass in the macroscopic limit. We also show that in this case, the rest of the particles are asymptotically \emph{i.i.d.} according to the normalized equilibrium state of the limit hydrodynamic differential equation. Conditions for the normal fluctuations and the $\alpha$-stable fluctuations around the condensed mass are given. We obtain the large deviation principle for the empirical measure of the masses of the particles at equilibrium as well.</description>

      <title>A generalized Liouville equation and magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers two related families of nonlinear and nonlocal problems in the plane $\R^2$. The first main result derives the general integrable solution to a generalized Liouville equation using the Wronskian of two coprime complex polynomials. The second main result concerns an application to a generalized Ladyzhenskaya--Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality, with a single real parameter $\beta$ interpreted as the strength of a magnetic self-interaction. The optimal constant of the inequality and the corresponding minimizers of the quotient are studied and it is proved that for $\beta \ge 2$, for which the constant equals $2\pi\beta$, such minimizers only exist at quantized $\beta \in 2\N$ corresponding to nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels with densities solving the generalized Liouville equation. This latter problem originates from the study of self-dual vortex solitons in the abelian Chern--Simons--Higgs theory and from the average-field-Pauli effective theory of anyons, i.e.\ quantum particles with statistics intermediate to bosons and fermions. An immediate application is given to Keller--Lieb--Thirring stability bounds for a gas of such anyons which self-interact magnetically (vector nonlocal repulsion) as well as electrostatically (scalar local/point attraction), thus generalizing the stability theory of the 2D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough \cite{Chatterjee}, Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model \cite{Edwards1975} utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in \cite{Chatterjee}. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>

Abstract: We give a generalization of Goncharov's Hodge correlator twistor connection. Our generalized version is a connection 1-form with values in a DG Lie algebra of uni-trivalent graphs which may have loops and satisfies some Maurer--Cartan equation. This connection and the Maurer--Cartan equation can be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of effective action and quantum master equation respectively in non-acyclic Chern--Simons perturbation theory associated with the trivial local system.</description>

Abstract: The metric of $S^7$ can be written as an $SU(2)$-instanton bundle over $S^4$. It is also possible to write it differently as an anti-instanton bundle. We use this observation to construct an instanton--anti-instanton, $SU(2)\times SU(2)$, bundle over $S^4$. We show that this 10d manifold admits two Einstein metrics. We then rewrite the metric to isolate two $U(1)$ directions of the fibre and dimensionally reduce along them to get an eight dimensional metric describing an $S^2\times S^2$ bundle over $S^4$. This metric allows a harmonic 4-form which we use to derive new supergravity solutions in eleven and ten dimensions as $AdS_3\times M_8$ and $AdS_2\times M_8$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Lax structure and tau function for large BKP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly investigate Lax structure and tau function for the large BKP hierarchy, which is also known as Toda hierarchy of B type, or Hirota--Ohta--coupled KP hierarchy, or Pfaff lattice. Firstly, the large BKP hierarchy can be derived from fermionic BKP hierarchy by using a special bosonization, which is presented in the form of bilinear equation. Then from bilinear equation, the corresponding Lax equation is given, where in particular the relation of flow generator with Lax operator is obtained. Also starting from Lax equation, the corresponding bilinear equation and existence of tau function are discussed. After that, large BKP hierarchy is viewed as sub--hierarchy of modified Toda (mToda) hierarchy, also called two--component first modified KP hierarchy. Finally by using two basic Miura transformations from mToda to Toda, we understand two typical relations between large BKP tau function $\tau_n(\mathbf{t})$ and Toda tau function $\tau_n^{\rm Toda}(\mathbf{t},-\mathbf{t})$, that is, $\tau_n^{{\rm Toda}}(\mathbf{t},-{\mathbf{t}})=\tau_n(\mathbf{t})\tau_{n-1}(\mathbf{t})$ and $\tau_n^{{\rm Toda}}(\mathbf{t},-{\mathbf{t}})=\tau_n^2(\mathbf{t})$. Further we find $\big(\tau_n(\mathbf{t})\tau_{n-1}(\mathbf{t}),\tau_n^2(\mathbf{t})\big)$ satisfies bilinear equation of mToda hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Bekenstein generalized entropy of Schwarzschild black hole, with the contribution of an external matter field affected by degrees of freedom inside the event horizon. To take into accountthis effect to the generalized entropy, we use Euclidean functional methods. In the Euclidean section of the Schwarzschild manifold, we consider an Euclidean quantum effective model, a scalar theory in the presence of an additive quenched disorder. The average the Gibbs free energy over the ensemble of possible configurations of the disorder is obtained by the distributional zeta-function method. In the series representation for the average free energy with respective effective actions emerges the generalized Schr\"{o}dinger operators on Riemannian manifolds. Finally, is presented the generalized entropy density with the contributions of the black hole geometric entropy and the external matter fields affected by the internal degrees of freedom. The validity of the generalized second law using Euclidean functional methods is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Villain interaction applied to lattice gauge theory can be obtained as the limit of both Wilson and Manton interactions on a larger graph which we call the {\em carpet graph.} This is the lattice gauge theory analog of a well-known property for spin $O(N)$ models where Villain type interactions are the limit of $\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ spin systems defined on a {\em cable graph}.
  Perhaps surprisingly in the setting of lattice gauge theory, our proof also applies to non-Abelian lattice theory such as $SU(3)$-lattice gauge theory and its limiting Villain interaction.
  In the particular case of an Abelian lattice gauge theory, this allows us to extend the validity of Ginibre inequality to the case of the Villain interaction.</description>

Abstract: We study translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer codes with qudits of arbitrary, not necessarily uniform, dimensions. Using homological methods, we define a series of invariants called charge modules. We describe their properties and physical meaning. The most complete results are obtained for codes whose charge modules have Krull dimension zero. This condition is interpreted as mobility of excitations. We show that it is always satisfied for translation invariant 2D codes with unique ground state in infinite volume, which was previously known only in the case of uniform, prime qudit dimension. For codes all of whose excitations are mobile we construct a $p$-dimensional excitation and a $(D-p-1)$-form symmetry for every element of the $p$-th charge module. Moreover, we define a braiding pairing between charge modules in complementary degrees. We discuss examples which illustrate how charge modules and braiding can be computed in practice.</description>

In particular we consider the elliptic stochastic quantization of the H{\o}egh--Krohn (or $\exp (\alpha \phi)_2$) EQFT in two dimensions. The first method is based on a path-wise coupling argument and PDE apriori estimates while the second on estimates of the Malliavin derivative of the solution to the SQ equation.</description>

      <title>Interior solution of azimuthally symmetric case of Laplace equation in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curvilinear coordinate systems distinct from the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system are particularly valuable in the field calculations as they facilitate the expression of boundary conditions of differential equations in a reasonably simple way when the coordinate surfaces fit the physical boundaries of the problem. The recently finalized orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. Such shape is aproximating well objects investigated within astrophysics. The solution of the azimuthally symmetric case of the Laplace equation was found for the interior space in the orthogonal SOS coordinates. In the frame of the derivation of the harmonic functions, the Laplace equation was separated by a special separation procedure. A generalized Legendre equation was introduced as the equation for the angular part of the separated Laplace equation. The harmonic functions were determined as relations involving generalized Legendre functions of the first and of the second kind. Several lower-degree functions are reported. Recursion formula facilitating determination of the higher-degree harmonic functions was found. The general solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation for the interior space in the SOS coordinates is reported.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and the related Steklov problem in spheroidal domains ranging from a needle to a disk. An explicit matrix representation of this operator for both interior and exterior problems is derived. We show how the anisotropy of spheroids affects the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator. As examples of physical applications, we discuss diffusion-controlled reactions on spheroidal partially reactive targets and the statistics of encounters between the diffusing particle and the spheroidal boundary.</description>

      <title>On Strong Bounds for Trotter and Zeno Product Formulas with Bosonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Trotter product formula and the quantum Zeno effect are both indispensable tools for constructing time-evolutions using experimentally feasible building blocks. In this work, we discuss assumptions under which quantitative bounds can be proven in the strong operator topology on Banach spaces and provide natural bosonic examples. Specially, we assume the existence of a continuously embedded Banach space, which relatively bounds the involved generators and creates an invariant subspace of the limiting semigroup with a stable restriction. The slightly stronger assumption of admissible subspaces is well-recognized in the realm of hyperbolic evolution systems (time-dependent semigroups), to which the results are extended. By assuming access to a hierarchy of continuously embedded Banach spaces, Suzuki-higher-order bounds can be demonstrated. In bosonic applications, these embedded Banach spaces naturally arise through the number operator, leading to a diverse set of examples encompassing notable instances such as the Bose-Hubbard model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and multi-photon driven dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

      <title>Conformal blocks for Galois covers of algebraic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.00118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spaces of twisted conformal blocks attached to a $\Gamma$-curve $\Sigma$ with marked $\Gamma$-orbits and an action of $\Gamma$ on a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite group. We prove that if $\Gamma$ stabilizes a Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, then Propagation Theorem and Factorization Theorem hold. We endow a flat projective connection on the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks attached to a smooth family of pointed $\Gamma$-curves; in particular, it is locally free. We also prove that the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks on the stable compactification of Hurwitz stack is locally free.
  Let $\mathscr{G}$ be the parahoric Bruhat-Tits group scheme on the quotient curve $\Sigma/\Gamma$ obtained via the $\Gamma$-invariance of Weil restriction associated to $\Sigma$ and the simply-connected simple algebraic group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that the space of twisted conformal blocks can be identified with the space of generalized theta functions on the moduli stack of quasi-parabolic $\mathscr{G}$-torsors on $\Sigma/\Gamma$ when the level $c$ is divisible by $|\Gamma|$ (establishing a conjecture due to Pappas-Rapoport).</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantisation of Yang-Mills-Higgs in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a state space and a Markov process associated to the stochastic quantisation equation of Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) theories. The state space $\mathcal{S}$ is a nonlinear metric space of distributions, elements of which can be used as initial conditions for the (deterministic and stochastic) YMH flow with good continuity properties. Using gauge covariance of the deterministic YMH flow, we extend gauge equivalence $\sim$ to $\mathcal{S}$ and thus define a quotient space of "gauge orbits" $\mathfrak{O}$. We use the theory of regularity structures to prove local in time solutions to the renormalised stochastic YMH flow. Moreover, by leveraging symmetry arguments in the small noise limit, we show that there is a unique choice of renormalisation counterterms such that these solutions are gauge covariant in law. This allows us to define a canonical Markov process on $\mathfrak{O}$ (up to a potential finite time blow-up) associated to the stochastic YMH flow.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness and exponential stability for Boussinesq systems on real hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and exponential decay of mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems in $L^p$-phase spaces on the framework of real hyperbolic manifold $\mathbb{H}^d(\mathbb{R})$, where $d \geqslant 2$ and $1&lt;p\leq d$. We consider a couple of Ebin-Marsden's Laplace and Laplace-Beltrami operators associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. Primarily, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the bounded mild solution for the linear system by using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup. Next, using the fixed point arguments, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to establish the existence of the bounded mild solutions. Due to Gronwall's inequality, we will clarify the exponential stability of such solutions. Finally, we give an application of stability to the existence of periodic mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for Multi-Point Functions of the 2D Discrete Gaussian Model at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study microscopic observables of the Discrete Gaussian model (i.e., the Gaussian free field restricted to take integer values) at high temperature using the renormalisation group method. In particular, we show the central limit theorem for the two-point function of the Discrete Gaussian model by computing the asymptotic of the moment generating function $\langle e^{z (\sigma (0) - \sigma (y))} \rangle_{\beta, \mathbb{Z}^2}^{\dg}$ for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ sufficiently small. The method we use has direct connection with the multi-scale polymer expansion used in \cite{dgauss1, dgauss2}, where it was used to study the scaling limit of the Discrete Gaussian model. The method also applies to multi-point functions and lattice models of sine-Gordon type studied in \cite{MR634447}.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closed form solution for the one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a finite number of $\delta$-interactions \[ \mathbf{L}_{q,\mathfrak{I}_{N}}y:=-y^{\prime\prime}+\left( q(x)+\sum _{k=1}^{N}\alpha_{k}\delta(x-x_{k})\right) y=\lambda y,\quad0&lt;x&lt;b,\;\lambda \in\mathbb{C}% \] is presented in terms of the solution of the unperturbed equation \[ \mathbf{L}_{q}y:=-y^{\prime\prime}+q(x)y=\lambda y,\quad0&lt;x&lt;b,\;\lambda \in\mathbb{C}% \] and a corresponding transmutation operator $\mathbf{T}_{\mathfrak{I}_{N}}^{f}$ is obtained in the form of a Volterra integral operator. With the aid of the spectral parameter power series method, a practical construction of the image of the transmutation operator on a dense set is presented, and it is proved that the operator $\mathbf{T}_{\mathfrak{I}_{N}}^{f}$ transmutes the second derivative into the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $\mathbf{L}_{q,\mathfrak{I}_{N}}$ on a Sobolev space $H^{2}$. A Fourier-Legendre series representation for the integral transmutation kernel is developed, from which a new representation for the solutions and their derivatives, in the form of a Neumann series of Bessel functions, is derived.</description>

      <title>Size-biased diffusion limits and the inclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the inclusion process on the complete graph with vanishing diffusivity, which leads to condensation of particles in the thermodynamic limit. Describing particle configurations in terms of size-biased and appropriately scaled empirical measures of mass distribution, we establish convergence in law of the inclusion process to a measure-valued Markov process on the space of probability measures. In the case where the diffusivity vanishes like the inverse of the system size, the derived scaling limit is equivalent to the well known Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, offering an alternative viewpoint on these well-established dynamics. Moreover, our approach covers all scaling regimes of the system parameters and yields a natural extension of the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion to infinite mutation rate. We also discuss in detail connections to known results on related Fleming-Viot processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized double affine Hecke algebras (GDAHA) are flat deformations of the group algebras of $2$-dimensional crystallographic groups associated to star-shaped simply laced affine Dynkin diagrams. In this paper, we first construct a functor that sends representations of the $\tilde D_4$-type GDAHA to representations of the $\tilde E_6$-type one for specialised parameters. Then, under no restrictions on the parameters, we construct embeddings of both GDAHAs of type $\tilde D_4$ and $\tilde E_6$ into matrix algebras over quantum cluster $\mathcal{X}$-varieties, thus linking to the theory of higher Teichm\"uller spaces. For $\tilde E_6$, the two explicit representations we provide over distinct quantum tori are shown to be related by quiver reductions and mutations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Lee-Yang and Fisher Zeros in the 2D Ising model through multipoint Pad\'e approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical calculation of the Lee-Yang and Fisher zeros of the 2D Ising model using multi-point Pad\'{e} approximants. We perform simulations for the 2D Ising model with ferromagnetic couplings both in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field using a cluster spin-flip algorithm. We show that it is possible to extract genuine signature of Lee Yang and Fisher zeros of the theory through the poles of magnetization and specific heat, using multi-point Pad\'{e} method. We extract the poles of magnetization using Pad\'{e} approximants and compare their scaling with known results. We verify the circle theorem associated to the well known behaviour of Lee Yang zeros. We present our finite volume scaling analysis of the zeros done at $T=T_c$ for a few lattice sizes, extracting to a good precision the (combination of) critical exponents $\beta \delta$. The computation at the critical temperature is performed after the latter has been determined via the study of Fisher zeros, thus extracting both $\beta_c$ and the critical exponent $\nu$. Results already exist for extracting the critical exponents for the Ising model in 2 and 3 dimensions making use of Fisher and Lee Yang zeros. In this work, multi-point Pad\'{e} is shown to be competitive with this respect and thus a powerful tool to study phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model of Qudit Measurement for Superconducting Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of superconducting quantum computing, based on Josephson junctions, has recently seen remarkable strides in scaling the number of logical qubits. In particular, the fidelities of one- and two-qubit gates are close to the breakeven point with the novel error mitigation and correction methods. Parallel to these advances is the effort to expand the Hilbert space within a single device by employing high-dimensional qubits, otherwise known as qudits. Research has demonstrated the possibility of driving higher-order transitions in a transmon or designing innovative multimode superconducting circuits, termed multimons. These advances can significantly expand the computational basis while simplifying the interconnects in a large-scale quantum processor. This thesis provides a detailed introduction to the superconducting qudit and demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of decoherence in an artificial atom with more than two levels using Lindblad master equations and stochastic master equations (SMEs). After extending the theory of the design, control, and readout of a conventional superconducting qubit to that of a qudit, the thesis focuses on modeling the dispersive measurement of a transmon qutrit in an open quantum system using quadrature detections. Under the Markov assumption, master equations with different levels of abstraction are proposed and solved; in addition, both the ensemble-averaged and the quantum-jump approach of decoherence analysis are presented and compared analytically and numerically. The thesis ends with a series of experimental results on a transmon-type qutrit, verifying the validity of the stochastic model.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and Characterization of Transmon Qutrits Through Bayesian Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust control of a quantum system is essential to utilize the current noisy quantum hardware to their full potential, such as quantum algorithms. To achieve such a goal, systematic search for an optimal control for any given experiment is essential. Design of optimal control pulses require accurate numerical models, and therefore, accurate characterization of the system parameters. We present an online, Bayesian approach for quantum characterization of qutrit systems which automatically and systematically identifies the optimal experiments that provide maximum information on the system parameters, thereby greatly reducing the number of experiments that need to be performed on the quantum testbed. Unlike most characterization protocols that provide point-estimates of the parameters, the proposed approach is able to estimate their probability distribution. The applicability of the Bayesian experimental design technique was demonstrated on test problems where each experiment was defined by a parameterized control pulse. In addition to this, we also presented an approach for iterative pulse extension which is robust under uncertainties in transition frequencies and coherence times, and shot noise, despite being initialized with wide uninformative priors. Furthermore, we provide a mathematical proof of the theoretical identifiability of the model parameters and present conditions on the quantum state under which the parameters are identifiable. The proof and conditions for identifiability are presented for both closed and open quantum systems using the Schroedinger equation and the Lindblad master equation respectively.</description>

      <title>Large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of $N_{\infty}$-soliton solutions (soliton gas) for the focusing Hirota equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hirota equation is one of the integrable higher-order extensions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and can describe the ultra-short optical pulse propagation in the form $iq_t+\alpha(q_{xx}+ 2|q|^2q)+i\beta (q_{xxx}+ 6|q|^2q_x)=0,\, (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\, (\alpha,\,\beta\in\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we analytically explore the asymptotic behaviors of a soliton gas for the Hirota equation including the complex modified KdV equation, in which the soliton gas is regarded as the limit $N\to \infty$ of $N$-soliton solutions, and characterized using the Riemann-Hilbert problem with discrete spectra restricted in the intervals $(ia, ib)\cup (-ib, -ia)\, (0&lt;a&lt;b)$. We find that this soliton gas tends slowly to the Jaocbian elliptic wave solution with an error $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-1})$ (zero exponentially quickly ) as $x\to -\infty$ ($x\to +\infty$). We also present the long-time asymptotics of the soliton gas under the different velocity conditions: $x/t&gt;4\beta b^2,\, \xi_c&lt;x/t&lt;4\beta b^2,\, x/t&lt;\xi_c$. Moreover, we analyze the property of the soliton gas for the case of the discrete spectra filling uniformly a quadrature domain.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $b$-Hurwitz numbers with a rational weight are obtained by taking an explicit limit of a Whittaker vector for the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra of type $A$. Our result is a vast generalization of several previous results that treated the monotone case, and the cases of quadratic and cubic polynomial weights. It also provides an interpretation of the associated Whittaker vector in terms of generalized branched coverings that might be of independent interest. Our result is new even in the special case $b=0$ that corresponds to classical hypergeometric Hurwitz numbers, and implies that they are governed by the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin. This gives an independent proof of the recent result of Bychkov-Dunin-Barkowski-Kazarian-Shadrin.</description>

Abstract: We give a precise microlocal description of the singular profile that forms in the long-time propagation of internal waves in an effectively two-dimensional aquarium. We allow domains with corners, such as polygons appearing in the experimental set ups of Maas et al. This extends the previous work of Dyatlov--Wang--Zworski arXiv:2112.10191, which considered domains with smooth boundary. We show that in addition to singularities that correspond to attractors in the underlying classical dynamics, milder singularities propagate out of the corners as well.</description>

The higher order mappings we use in this study are all obtained by coupling mappings that are integrable through spectral methods, typically belonging to the QRT family, to a variety of linearisable ones. We show that by judiciously choosing these linearisable mappings, it is possible to obtain higher order mappings that exhibit the maximal degree growth compatible with integrability, i.e. for which the degree grows as a polynomial of order equal to the order of the mapping. In all the cases we analysed, we found that maximal degree growth was associated with the existence of an unconfining singularity pattern. Several cases with submaximal growth but which still possess unconfining singularity patterns are also presented. In many cases the exact degrees of the iterates of the mappings were obtained by applying a method due to Halburd, based on the preimages of specific values that appear in the singularity patterns of the mapping, but we also present some examples where such a calculation appears to be impossible.</description>

      <title>Wall-Crossing Effects on Quiver BPS Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The well-known wall-crossing phenomena are that the fixed point spectrum establishes a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space into a collection of stability chambers -- ``phases'' of the theory. The standard construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases (chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them glasses and also divide in a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as new wall-crossing invariants.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness and Orbital Stability of Slow and Fast Solitary Wave Solutions of the Benjamin Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of existence and properties of solitary waves of the Benjamin equation. The studied equation includes a parameter $\gamma$ in front of the Benjamin-Ono term. We show the existence, uniqueness, decay and orbital stability of solitary wave solutions obtained as a solution to a certain minimization problem, associated either with high speeds without a sign condition on the parameter $\gamma$ or with low speeds for the appropriate sign.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. The existence and uniqueness of a spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, is first proved by I. Hashimoto and A. Matsumura in 2021. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. Moreover, we also derive a set of decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the long time stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ under small initial perturbations using the energy method. The main difficulty for this is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Virtual Structure Constants and Generalizations of BCOV-Zinger Formula to Projective Fano Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>
