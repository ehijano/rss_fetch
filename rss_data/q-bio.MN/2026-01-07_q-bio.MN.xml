      <title>Simple chemical systems with chaos</title>

Abstract: A number of simple chaotic three-dimensional dynamical systems (DSs) with quadratic polynomials on the right-hand sides are reported in the literature, containing exactly 5 or 6 monomials of which only 1 or 2 are quadratic. However, none of these simple systems are chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a special subset of polynomial DSs that model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs). In particular, only a small number of three-dimensional quadratic CDSs with chaos are reported, all of which have at least 9 monomials and at least 3 quadratics, with CRNs containing at least 7 reactions and at least 3 quadratic ones. To bridge this gap, in this paper we prove some basic properties of chaotic CDSs, including that those in three dimensions have at least 6 monomials, at least one of which is negative and quadratic. We then use these results to computationally find 20 chaotic three-dimensional CDSs with 6 monomials and as few as 4 quadratics, or 7 monomials and as few as 2 quadratics. At the CRN level, some of these systems have 4 reactions of which only 3 are quadratic, or 5 reactions with only 2 being quadratic. These results quantify structural complexity of chaotic CDSs, and indicate that they are ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</description>
