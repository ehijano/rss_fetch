      <title>Sequences of multiple products and cohomology classes for foliations of complex curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of transversality is explored in the construction of cohomology theory associated to regularized sequences of multiple products of rational functions associated to vertex algebra cohomology of codimension one foliations on complex curves. Explicit formulas for cohomology invariants results from consideration transversality conditions applied to sequences of multiple products for elements of chain-cochain transversal complexes defined for codimension one foliations.</description>

      <title>Stable STFT phase retrieval and Poincar\'e inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work [P. Grohs and M. Rathmair. Stable Gabor Phase Retrieval and Spectral Clustering. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics (2018)] and [P. Grohs and M. Rathmair. Stable Gabor phase retrieval for multivariate functions. Journal of the European Mathematical Society (2021)] the instabilities of Gabor phase retrieval problem, i.e. reconstructing $ f\in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ from its spectrogram $|\mathcal{V}_g f|$ where $$\mathcal{V}_g f(x,\xi) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(t)\overline{g(t-x)}e^{-2\pi i \xi t}\,\mbox{d}t,$$ have been classified in terms of the connectivity of the measurements. These findings were however crucially restricted to the case where the window $g(t)=e^{-\pi t^2}$ is Gaussian. In this work we establish a corresponding result for a number of other window functions including the one-sided exponential $g(t)=e^{-t}\mathbb{1}_{[0,\infty)}(t)$ and $g(t)=\exp(t-e^t)$. As a by-product we establish a modified version of Poincar\'e's inequality which can be applied to non-differentiable functions and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Faces of quasidensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the various structures associated with maximally monotone and quasidense subsets of the product of a real Banach space and its dual. In the first half of the paper, we give four statements equivalent to the assertion that a maximally monotone subset be quasidense, including the statement that the set be of ``type (NI)''. Then we consider the Fitzpatrick and Gossez extensions of a maximally monotone set to the dual. We give eight equivalent formulations for the Fitzpatrick extension of a quasidense maximally monotone set and prove that in, this case, the Fitzpatrick and Gossez extensions coincide. This leads to the result that a maximally monotone set is quasidense exactly when it is of ``type (D)''. We also give an example of a quasidense maximally monotone set whose Fitzpatrick extension, though maximally monotone, is not quasidense. In the final part of this paper, we prove that a maximally monotone set is quasidense if, and only if, it is of ``type (FP)''. The proof of ``only if'' is much simpler than the two which have been given up to now.</description>

      <title>Isometric Jordan isomorphisms of group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ and $H$ be locally compact groups. We will show that each contractive Jordan isomorphism $\Phi\colon L^1(G)\to L^1(H)$ is either an isometric isomorphism or an isometric anti-isomorphism. We will apply this result to study isometric two-sided zero product preservers on group algebras and, further, to study local and approximately local isometric automorphisms of group algebras.</description>

      <title>Unified approach to reciprocal matrices with Kippenhahn curves containing elliptical components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocal matrices are tridiagonal matrices $(a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n$ with constant main diagonal and such that $a_{i,i+1}a_{i+1,i}=1$ for $i=1,\ldots,n-1$. For these matrices, criteria are established under which their Kippenhahn curves contain elliptical components or even consist completely of such. These criteria are in terms of system of homogeneous polynomial equations in variables $(\left|a_{j,j+1}\right|-\left|a_{j+1,j}\right|)^2$, and established via a unified approach across arbitrary dimensions. The results are illustrated, and specific numerical examples provided, for $n=7$ thus generalizing earlier work in the lower dimensional setting.</description>

Abstract: Let $H_1$ and $H_2$ be two Hilbert spaces, $K$ and $L$ be bounded operatrors on $H_1$ and $H_2$ respectively. In this paper we study the relationship between $K$-frames for $H_1$ and $L$-frames for $H_2$ and $K\oplus L$-frames for $H_1\oplus H_2$. The $K\oplus L$-minimal frames and $K\oplus L$-orthonormal bases for $H_1\oplus H_2$ are also studied.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the function $\varphi_1$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, first studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$, and the sequence $(\tau_n-n-\frac12)$ has $\ell^2$ norm bounded by $0.13$. The zeros $\tau_n$ can be computed by means of a fixed point iteration.</description>

      <title>Self-absorption of Hankel systems on monoids --a seemingly universal property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any cancellative monoid $\mathcal{M}$, we study the Hankel system determined by its multiplication table. We prove that the Hankel system admits self-absorption property provided that the monoid $\mathcal{M}$ has the local algebraic structure: \[ \big(ax = by, cx=dy, az=bw \,\, \text{in $\mathcal{M}$}\big)\Longrightarrow \big(cz=dw \,\, \text{in $\mathcal{M}$}\big). \] Our result holds for all group-embeddable monoids and goes beyond. In particular, it works for all cancellative Abelian monoids and most common non-Abelian cancellative monoids such as $$ \mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{N}): = \big\{[a_{ij}]_{1\le i,j\le d}\in \mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{Z})\big| a_{ij} \in \mathbb{N}\big\}. $$ The Hankel system determined by the multiplication table of a monoid is further generalized to that determined by level sets of any abstract two-variable map. We introduce an algebraic notion of lunar maps and establish a stronger hereditary self-absorption property for the corresponding generalized Hankel systems. As a consequence, we prove the self-absorption property for arbitrary spatial compression of the regular representation system $\{\lambda_G(g)\}_{g\in G}$ of any discrete group $G$, as well as the Hankel system $\{\Gamma_\ell^\Phi\}$ determined by the level sets of any rational map of the form $\Phi(x,y)=a x^m + b y^n$ with $a,b,m,n\in \mathbb{Z}^*$: \[ \Gamma_\ell^{\Phi}(x, y)= \mathbf{1}(a x^m + b y^n= \ell), \quad x, y\in \mathbb{N}^*, \, \ell\in \Phi (\mathbb{N}^*\times \mathbb{N}^*). \] The self-absorption property is applied to the study of completely bounded Fourier multipliers between Hardy spaces. Further applications are: i) exact complete bounded norm of the Carleman embedding in any dimension; ii) mixed Fourier-Schur multiplier inequalities with critical exponent $4/3$; iii) failure of hyper-complete-contractivity for the Poisson semigroup.</description>

      <title>Analog version of Hausdorff--Young's theorem for quadratic Fourier transforms and boundedness of oscillatory integral operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first aim is based on the Riesz--Thorin interpolation theorem. We establish several of the Hausdorff--Young type theorems for the Quadratic Fourier transforms in (Ann. Funct. Anal. 2014;5(1):10--23) and linear canonical transforms in (Mediterr. J. Math. 2018;15,13), which were introduced by Castro et al. The second aim is to investigate the boundedness of the oscillatory integral operator with polynomial phases, which is also presented in the last section of the article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that a formula for the pushforward measures on the fiber bundle $ G \to G / H $ of homogeneous space of locally compact groups $ G $ and $ H $ can be written down by using the modular functions. As a result, we obtain the equality \begin{align} \frac{ \Delta_G ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ G / N } ( h N ) } = \frac{ \Delta_H ( h ) }{ \Delta_{ H / N } ( h N ) } \end{align} on the modular functions for any closed subgroups $ N $ and $ H $ of a locally compact group $ G $ with $ N \lhd G $ and $ N \subset H \subset G $ and any $ h \in H $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider smooth vector bundles over smooth manifolds equipped with non-smooth geometric data. For nilpotent differential operators acting on these bundles, we show that the kernels of induced Hodge-Dirac-type operators remain isomorphic under uniform perturbations of the geometric data. We consider applications of this to the Hodge-Dirac operator on differential forms induced by so-called rough Riemannian metrics, which can be of only measurable coefficient in regularity, on both compact and non-compact settings. As a consequence, we show that the kernel of the associated non-smooth Hodge-Dirac operator with respect to a rough Riemannian metric remains isomorphic to smooth and singular cohomology when the underlying manifold is compact.</description>

      <title>Bridging Smoothness and Approximation: Theoretical Insights into Over-Smoothing in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the approximation theory of functions defined on graphs. Our study builds upon the approximation results derived from the $K$-functional. We establish a theoretical framework to assess the lower bounds of approximation for target functions using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and examine the over-smoothing phenomenon commonly observed in these networks. Initially, we introduce the concept of a $K$-functional on graphs, establishing its equivalence to the modulus of smoothness. We then analyze a typical type of GCN to demonstrate how the high-frequency energy of the output decays, an indicator of over-smoothing. This analysis provides theoretical insights into the nature of over-smoothing within GCNs. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for the approximation of target functions by GCNs, which is governed by the modulus of smoothness of these functions. This finding offers a new perspective on the approximation capabilities of GCNs. In our numerical experiments, we analyze several widely applied GCNs and observe the phenomenon of energy decay. These observations corroborate our theoretical results on exponential decay order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To prove that a measure, linearly representable by means of a finite set of nonnegative matrices $\mathcal M$, has the weak-Gibbs property, one check the uniform convergence (on $\mathcal M^\mathbb N$) of the sequence of vectors $\frac{A_1\cdots A_nc}{\Vert A_1\cdots A_nc\Vert}$ ($c$ positive column-vector). The main theorem gives a sufficient condition for this sequence to converge pointwise. This theorem generalizes the Birkhoff contraction method because it can be used even if the matrices have many zero entries. We also look at the convergence of the sequence of matrices $\frac{A_1\cdots A_n}{\Vert A_1\cdots A_n\Vert}$. The measures defined by Bernoulli convolution are in certain cases linearly representable; we give two example of weak-Gibbs Bernoullt convolutions, by using the Birkhoff contraction coefficient for the first and the theorem for the second. Furthermore we explicit the relationship between the notions of Bernoulli convolution, fundamental curves and lattice two-scale difference equations.</description>

      <title>On Dirichlet-type and $n$-isometric shifts in finite rank de~Branges--Rovnyak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the function spaces $\mathcal{D}(\mu)$ by Richter and Aleman, and $\mathcal{D}_{\vec{\mu}}$ by the second author.
  It is known that the forward shift $M_z$ is bounded and expansive on $\mathcal{D}(\mu)$, and therefore $\mathcal{D}(\mu)$ coincides with a de~Branges--Rovnyak space $\mathcal{H}[B]$. We show that such a $B$ is rational if and only if $\mu$ is finitely atomic, and this happens exactly when the corresponding defect operator has finite rank. We also outline a method for calculating the reproducing kernel of $\mathcal{D}(\mu)$ for finitely atomic $\mu$.
  Similarly, we characterize the allowable tuples $\vec{\mu} = (\frac{|dz|}{2\pi}, \mu_1, \ldots, \mu_{n-1})$ such that $M_z$ on $\mathcal{D}_{\vec{\mu}}$ is expansive with finite rank defect operator. This investigation provides many interesting examples of normalized allowable tuples $\vec{\mu}$.</description>

      <title>Classes of operators related to subnormal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we attempt to lay the foundations for a theory encompassing some natural extensions of the class of subnormal operators, namely the $n$--subnormal operators and the sub-$n$--normal operators. We discuss inclusion relations among the above mentioned classes and other related classes, e.g., $n$--quasinormal and quasi-$n$--normal operators. We show that sub-$n$--normality is stronger than $n$--subnormality, and produce a concrete example of a $3$--subnormal operator which is not sub-$2$--normal. In \cite{CU1}, R.E. Curto, S.H. Lee and J. Yoon proved that if an operator $T$ is subnormal, left-invertible, and such that $T^n$ is quasinormal for some $n \le 2$, then $T$ is quasinormal. in \cite{JS}, P.Pietrzycki and J. Stochel improved this result by removing the assumption of left invertibility. In this paper we consider suitable analogs of this result for the case of operators in the above-mentioned classes. In particular, we prove that the weight sequence of an $n$--quasinormal unilateral weighted shift must be periodic with period at most $n$.</description>

      <title>The generalized strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy for bosonic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.05627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy for bosonic quantum Gaussian systems. Such generalization determines the minimum values of linear combinations of the entropies of subsystems associated to arbitrary linear functions of the quadratures, and holds for arbitrary quantum states including the scenario where the entropies are conditioned on a memory quantum system. We apply our result to prove new entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory, a generalization of the quantum Entropy Power Inequality, and the linear time scaling of the entanglement entropy produced by quadratic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fourier extension on fractional surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $\alpha\geq 2$, we investigate a class of Fourier extension operators on fractional surfaces $(\xi,|\xi|^\alpha)$. For the corresponding $\alpha$-Strichartz inequalities, by applying the missing mass method and bilinear restriction theory, we characterize the precompactness of extremal sequences. Our result is valid in any dimension. In particular for dimension two, our result implies the existence of extremals for $\alpha \in [2,\alpha_0)$ with some $\alpha_0&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>On certain Navier-Stokes flows on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies bounded conditions on curvature tensors. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Spherical maximal functions on two step nilpotent Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider $\mathbb R^d\times \mathbb R^m$ with the group structure of a two-step nilpotent Lie group and natural parabolic dilations. The maximal function originally introduced by Nevo and Thangavelu in the setting of the Heisenberg group deals with noncommutative convolutions associated to measures on spheres or generalized spheres in $\mathbb R^d$. We drop the nondegeneracy condition in the known results on M\'etivier groups and prove the sharp $L^p$ boundedness result for all two step nilpotent Lie groups with $d\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Concentration and local smoothness of the averaging process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the averaging process on the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. On this graph, the process is known to converge to equilibrium on diffusive timescales, not exhibiting cutoff. In this work, we refine this picture in two ways. Firstly, we prove a concentration phenomenon of the averaging process around its mean, occurring on a shorter timescale than the one of its relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we establish sharp gradient estimates, which capture its fast local smoothness property. This is the first setting in which these two features of the averaging process -- concentration and local smoothness -- can be quantified. These features carry useful information on a number of large scale properties of the averaging process. As an illustration of this fact, we determine the limit profile of its distance to equilibrium and derive a quantitative hydrodynamic limit for it. Finally, we discuss their implications on cutoff for the binomial splitting process, the particle analogue of the averaging process.</description>

      <title>How do the lengths of switching intervals influence the stability of a dynamical system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a linear switching system with frequent switches is stable, will it be stable under arbitrary switches? In general, the answer is negative. Nevertheless, this question can be answered in an explicit form for any concrete system. This is done by finding the mode-dependent critical lengths of switching intervals after which any enlargement does not influence the stability. The solution is given in terms of the exponential polynomials of least deviation from zero on a segment (``Chebyshev-like'' polynomials). By proving several theoretical results on exponential polynomial approximation we derive an algorithm for finding such polynomials and for computing the critical switching time. The convergence of the algorithm is estimated and numerical results are provided.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>On the openness of the idempotent barycenter map related to a t-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the idempotent barycenter map, associated with a t-norm $\ast$, is open if and only if the map of max-$\ast$ convex combination is open. As a corollary, we deduce that the idempotent barycenter map is open for spaces of idempotent measures associated with any t-norm $\ast$. Nevertheless, we illustrate that the characteristics of the idempotent barycenter map, in general, depend on the specific t-norm being employed.</description>

      <title>Algorithms of constrained uniform approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of the best uniform approximation of a continuous function on a convex domain. The approximation is by linear combinations of a finite system of functions (not necessarily Chebyshev) under arbitrary linear constraints. By modifying the concept of alternance and of the Remez iterative procedure we present a method, which demonstrates its efficiency in numerical problems. The linear rate of convergence is proved under some favourable assumptions. A special attention is paid to systems of complex exponents, Gaussian functions, lacunar algebraic and trigonometric polynomials. Applications to signal processing, linear ODE, switching dynamical systems, and to Markov-Bernstein type inequalities are considered.</description>
