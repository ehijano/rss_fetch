      <title>On Finding All Connected Maximum-Sized Common Subgraphs in Multiple Labeled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact algorithm for computing the connected Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) across multiple graphs, where edges or vertices may additionally be labeled to account for possible atom types or bond types, a classical labeling used in molecular graphs. Our approach leverages modular product graphs and a modified Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to enumerate maximal cliques, ensuring all intermediate solutions are retained. A pruning heuristic efficiently reduces the modular product size, improving computational feasibility. Additionally, we introduce a graph ordering strategy based on graph-kernel similarity measures to optimize the search process. Our method is particularly relevant for bioinformatics and cheminformatics, where identifying conserved structural motifs in molecular graphs is crucial. Empirical results on molecular datasets demonstrate that our approach is exact, scalable and fast.</description>

      <title>Distributed Freeze Tag: a Sustainable Solution to Discover and Wake-up a Robot Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Freeze Tag Problem consists in waking up a swarm of robots starting with one initially awake robot. Whereas there is a wide literature of the centralized setting, where the location of the robots is known in advance, we focus in the distributed version where the location of the robots $\P$ are unknown, and where awake robots only detect other robots up to distance~$1$. Assuming that moving at distance $\delta$ takes a time $\delta$, we show that waking up of the whole swarm takes $O(\rho+\ell^2\log( \rho/\ell))$, where $\rho$ stands for the largest distance from the initial robot to any point of $\P$, and the $\ell$ is the connectivity threshold of $\P$. Moreover, the result is complemented by a matching lower bound in both parameters $\rho$ and $\ell$. We also provide other distributed algorithms, complemented with lower bounds, whenever each robot has a bounded amount of energy.</description>

      <title>Randomized $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ Bellman-Ford from Fineman and the Boilermakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical algorithm by Bellman and Ford from the 1950's computes shortest paths in weighted graphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with possibly negative weights in $O(mn)$ time. Indeed, this algorithm is taught regularly in undergraduate Algorithms courses.
  In 2023, after nearly 70 years, Fineman \cite{fineman2024single} developed an $\tilde{O}(m n^{8/9})$ expected time algorithm for this problem. Huang, Jin and Quanrud improved on Fineman's startling breakthrough by providing an $\tilde{O}(m n^{4/5} )$ time algorithm.
  This paper builds on ideas from those results to produce an $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ expected time algorithm. The simple observation that distances can be updated with respect to the reduced costs for a price function in linear time is key to the improvement. This almost immediately improves the previous work. To produce the final bound, this paper provides recursive versions of Fineman's structures.</description>

      <title>Light Tree Covers, Routing, and Path-Reporting Oracles via Spanning Tree Covers in Doubling Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch tree cover of an edge-weighted $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a collection of trees, where every pair of vertices has a $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch path in one of the trees. The celebrated Dumbbell Theorem by Arya et. al. [STOC'95] states that any set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space admits a $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch tree cover with a constant number of trees, where the constant depends on $\varepsilon$ and the dimension $d$. This result was generalized for arbitrary doubling metrics by Bartal et. al. [ICALP'19]. While the total number of edges in the tree covers of Arya et. al. and Bartal et. al. is $O(n)$, all known tree cover constructions incur a total lightness of $\Omega(\log n)$; whether one can get a tree cover of constant lightness has remained a longstanding open question, even for 2-dimensional point sets.
  In this work we resolve this fundamental question in the affirmative, as a direct corollary of a new construction of $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch spanning tree cover for doubling graphs; in a spanning tree cover, every tree may only use edges of the input graph rather than the corresponding metric. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first constant-stretch spanning tree cover construction (let alone for $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch) with a constant number of trees, for any nontrivial family of graphs.
  Concrete applications of our spanning tree cover include a $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch light tree cover, a compact $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch routing scheme in the labeled model, and a $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretch path-reporting distance oracle, for doubling graphs. [...]</description>

      <title>Path Cover, Hamiltonicity, and Independence Number: An FPT Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic theorem of Gallai and Milgram (1960) asserts that for every graph G, the vertex set of G can be partitioned into at most \alpha(G) vertex-disjoint paths, where \alpha(G) is the maximum size of an independent set in G. The proof of Gallai--Milgram's theorem is constructive and yields a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a covering of G by at most \alpha(G) vertex-disjoint paths.
  We prove the following algorithmic extension of Gallai--Milgram's theorem for undirected graphs: determining whether an undirected graph can be covered by fewer than \alpha(G) - k vertex-disjoint paths is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by k. More precisely, we provide an algorithm that, for an n-vertex graph G and an integer parameter k \ge 1, runs in time 2^{k^{O(k^4)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}, and outputs a path cover P of G. Furthermore, it:
  - either correctly reports that P is a minimum-size path cover,
  - or outputs, together with P, an independent set of size |P| + k certifying that P contains at most \alpha(G) - k paths.
  A key subroutine in our algorithm is an FPT algorithm, parameterized by \alpha(G), for deciding whether G contains a Hamiltonian path. This result is of independent interest -- prior to our work, no polynomial-time algorithm for deciding Hamiltonicity was known even for graphs with independence number at most 3. Moreover, the techniques we develop apply to a wide array of problems in undirected graphs, including Hamiltonian Cycle, Path Cover, Largest Linkage, and Topological Minor Containment. We show that all these problems are FPT when parameterized by the independence number of the graph.
  Notably, the independence number parameterization, which describes graph's density, departs from the typical flow of research in parameterized complexity, which focuses on parameters describing graph's sparsity, like treewidth or vertex cover.</description>

      <title>A $5/4$-Approximation for Two-Edge Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2ECSS) is among the most basic survivable network design problems: given an undirected and unweighted graph, the task is to find a spanning subgraph with the minimum number of edges that is 2-edge-connected (i.e., it remains connected after the removal of any single edge). 2ECSS is an NP-hard problem that has been extensively studied in the context of approximation algorithms. The best known approximation ratio for 2ECSS prior to this work was $1.3+\varepsilon$, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$ [Garg, Grandoni, Jabal-Ameli'23; Kobayashi, Noguchi'23]. In this paper, we present a 5/4-approximation algorithm. Our algorithm is also faster for small values of $\varepsilon$: its running time is $n^{O(1)}$ instead of $n^{O(1/\varepsilon)}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Locality Sensitive Orderings in Doubling Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their pioneering work, Chan, Har-Peled, and Jones (SICOMP 2020) introduced locality-sensitive ordering (LSO), and constructed an LSO with a constant number of orderings for point sets in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Furthermore, their LSO could be made dynamic effortlessly under point insertions and deletions, taking $O(\log{n})$ time per update by exploiting Euclidean geometry. Their LSO provides a powerful primitive to solve a host of geometric problems in both dynamic and static settings. Filtser and Le (STOC 2022) constructed the first LSO with a constant number of orderings in the more general setting of doubling metrics. However, their algorithm is inherently static since it relies on several sophisticated constructions in intermediate steps, none of which is known to have a dynamic version. Making their LSO dynamic would recover the full generality of LSO and provide a general tool to dynamize a vast number of static constructions in doubling metrics.
  In this work, we give a dynamic algorithm that has $O(\log{n})$ time per update to construct an LSO in doubling metrics under point insertions and deletions. We introduce a toolkit of several new data structures: a pairwise tree cover, a net tree cover, and a leaf tracker. A key technical is stabilizing the dynamic net tree of Cole and Gottlieb (STOC 2006), a central dynamic data structure in doubling metrics. Specifically, we show that every update to the dynamic net tree can be decomposed into a few simple updates to trees in the net tree cover. As stability is the key to any dynamic algorithm, our technique could be useful for other problems in doubling metrics.
  We obtain several algorithmic applications from our dynamic LSO. The most notably is the first dynamic algorithm for maintaining an $k$-fault tolerant spanner in doubling metrics with optimal sparsity in optimal $O(\log{n})$ time per update.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via C-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. Informally, we say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $1/2$-local spectral expander. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top-link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for "sparse complexes" such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>
