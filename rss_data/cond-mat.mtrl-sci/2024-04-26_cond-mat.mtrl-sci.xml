      <title>Mach-Zehnder Interferometer for spin waves: computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometers are some of the most important optical devices, yet their spin wave based analogues so far received limited attention. In this work we demonstrate how one can design Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) operating on spin waves, and use to construct a spin wave version of a well known1 MZI based AI computing device. Modeling, performed both micromagnetically and by using a novel, finite difference based method, shows that some of the achievable operational parameters are orders of magnitude superior to both optical and CMOS based implementations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Interatomic Potential Connects Molecular Structural Ordering to Macroscale Properties of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is an important commercial polymer, bearing atactic stereochemistry resulting from nonselective radical polymerization. As such, an accurate, fundamental understanding of governing interactions among PAN molecular units are indispensable to advance the design principles of final products at reduced processability costs. While ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations can provide the necessary accuracy for treating key interactions in polar polymers such as dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, and analyzing their influence on molecular orientation, their implementation is limited to small molecules only. Herein, we show that the neural network interatomic potentials (NNIP) that are trained on the small-scale AIMD data (acquired for oligomers) can be efficiently employed to examine the structures/properties at large scales (polymers). NNIP provides critical insight into intra- and interchain hydrogen bonding and dipolar correlations, and accurately predicts the amorphous bulk PAN structure validated by modeling the experimental X-ray structure factor. Furthermore, the NNIP-predicted PAN properties such as density and elastic modulus are in good agreement with their experimental values. Overall, the trend in the elastic modulus is found to correlate strongly with the PAN structural orientations encoded in Hermans orientation factor. This study enables the ability to predict the structure-property relations for PAN and analogs with sustainable ab initio accuracy across scales.</description>

      <title>Structural investigation of the quasi-one-dimensional topological insulator Bi$_4$I$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bismuth-halide Bi$_4$I$_4$ undergoes a structural transition around $T_P\sim 300$K, which separates a high-temperature $\beta$ phase ($T&gt;T_P$) from a low-temperature $\alpha$ phase ($T&lt;T_P$). $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases are suggested to host electronic band structures with distinct topological classifications. Rapid quenching was reported to stabilize a metastable $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ at $T&lt;T_P$, making possible a comparative study of the physical properties of the two phases in the same low-temperature range. In this work, we present a structural investigation of the Bi$_4$I$_4$ before and after quenching together with electrical resistivity measurements. We found that rapid cooling does not consistently lead to a metastable $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$, and a quick transition to $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ is observed. As a result, the comparison of putative signatures of different topologies attributed to a specific structural phase should be carefully considered. The observed phase instability is accompanied by an increase in iodine vacancies and by a change in the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, pointing to native defects as a possible origin of our finding. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the scenario that iodine vacancies, together with bismuth antisites and interstitials, are among the defects that are more likely to occur in Bi$_4$I$_4$ during the growth.</description>

      <title>Dynamically induced multiferroic polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a mechanism by which both ferroelectric polarization and magnetization can be created in nonpolar, nonmagnetic materials. Using a combination of phenomenological modeling and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that ferroelectric polarization, magnetization, or both simultaneously can be transiently induced by an ultrashort laser pulse upon linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized excitation of phonon modes in $\gamma$-LiBO$_2$. The direction and magnitude of the multiferroic polarization can be controlled by the chirality of the laser pulse and the phonon modes, offering a pathway for controlling multiferroicity and magnetoelectricity on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of layered gold tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_2$Te$_3$ and their semiconducting and metallic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$) claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials, leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown. Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ (montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal synthesis of AuSbTe.</description>

      <title>Tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of NiBr$_2$ via pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dihalides (MX$_2$, M= transition metal, X= halide) have attracted much attention recently due to their intriguing low-dimensional magnetic properties. Particular focus has been placed in this family in the context of multiferroicity -- a common occurrence in MX$_2$ compounds that adopt non-collinear magnetic structures. One example of helimagnetic multiferroic material in the dihalide family is represented by NiBr$_2$. Here, we study the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this material under pressure using first-principles calculations combined with Monte Carlo simulations. Our results indicate there is significant magnetic frustration in NiBr$_2$ due to the competing interactions arising from its underlying triangular lattice. This magnetic frustration increases with pressure and is at the origin of the helimagnetic order. Further, pressure causes a sizable increase in the interlayer interactions. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that a large (3-fold) increase in the helimagnetic transition temperature can be achieved at pressures of around 15 GPa. This indicates that hydrostatic pressure can indeed be used as a tuning knob to increase the magnetic transition temperature of NiBr$_2$.</description>

      <title>Phonon dispersion of quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 in electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report on an elastic and inelastic neutron scattering study addressing the effect of electric fields on quantum paraelectric SrTiO3. Our elastic scattering results find small changes as a function of field in a superlattice reflection that sample the octahedral rotations, which is indicative of only weak coupling of octahedral rotation and electric polarization. By collecting not only the change in gap, but also of the dispersion, we can better quantify the changes in the lattice dynamics. The findings are put in context to recent field DFT calculations predicting the E-field effect on the atomic motions of the lowest lying transverse optical (soft) mode. We find hints of non-linear coupling to the acoustic mode and to the phonon with polarization perpendicular to the E-field, which shows the non-linearity in the chemical potential that is also relevant when strongly driving SrTiO3 with E-field (THz) pulses.</description>

      <title>Antibacterial size effect of ZnO nanoparticles and their role as additives in emulsion waterborne paint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nosocomial infections (NIs) are prevalent in intensive care units due to antibiotic overuse. Metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), like ZnO, offer potential solutions, yet understanding how NPs size impacts their antibacterial efficacy are lacking. This study focuses on the effect of nanoparticle size on kinetics of bacterial strains growth. NPs were synthesized using a sol-gel process with monoethanolamine (MEA) and water, characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy, confirming crystallization and size variations. ZnO NPs with mean size of 22, 35 and 66 nm were used against the most common nosocomial bacteria strains Escherichia coli (Gram-negative), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative), and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive). The evaluation of NPs minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and bactericidal concentration (MBC) revealed superior antibacterial activity in smaller NPs. The bacterial population was monitored via optical absorbance, showing reduced specific growth rate, prolonged latency period, and increased inhibition percentage with smaller NPs, indicating a substantial deceleration in the growth of microorganisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited the smallest sensitivity to ZnO NPs, attributed to its environmental stress resistance. Furthermore, the antibacterial efficacy of paint containing 1 wt% of 22 nm ZnO NPs was assessed and displayed activity against E. coli and S. aureus.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into Inorganic Antiperovskite Nitrides (X$_3$NA; X = Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba; A = Sb, As): An Emerging Class of Materials for Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiperovskite nitrides are potential candidates for applications harvesting solar light. With a comprehensive state-of-the-art approach combining hybrid density-functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, the Wannier-Mott model, density-functional perturbation theory, and the Feynman polaron model, we explore excitonic and polaronic effects in X$_3$NA (X: Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, A = Sb, As). For all of them, we uncover a significant influence of the ionic dielectric screening on the static dielectric constant. Small exciton binding energies, weak electron-phonon coupling, and high charge-carrier mobilities facilitate enhanced charge transport in Mg$_3$NSb, Sr$_3$NSb, and Ba$_3$NSb. Our results highlight the potential of these nitrides as optimal candidates for efficient photovoltaic absorbers.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetoresistance in altermagnetic MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, MnTe was established as an altermagnetic material that hosts spin-polarized electronic bands as well as anomalous transport effects like the anomalous Hall effect. In addition to these effects arising from altermagnetism, MnTe also hosts other magnetoresistance effects. Here, we study the manipulation of the magnetic order by an applied magnetic field and its impact on the electrical resistivity. In particular, we establish which components of anisotropic magnetoresistance are present when the magnetic order is rotated within the hexagonal basal plane. Our experimental results, which are in agreement with our symmetry analysis of the magnetotransport components, showcase the existence of an anisotropic magnetoresistance linked to both the relative orientation of current and magnetic order, as well as crystal and magnetic order.</description>

      <title>3D deep learning for enhanced atom probe tomography analysis of nanoscale microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of microstructural features on the nanoscale, including precipitates, local chemical orderings (LCOs) or structural defects (e.g. stacking faults) plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanical and physical responses of engineering materials. Atom probe tomography (APT), known for its exceptional combination of chemical sensitivity and sub-nanometer resolution, primarily identifies microstructures through compositional segregations. However, this fails when there is no significant segregation, as can be the case for LCOs and stacking faults. Here, we introduce a 3D deep learning approach, AtomNet, designed to process APT point cloud data at the single-atom level for nanoscale microstructure extraction, simultaneously considering compositional and structural information. AtomNet is showcased in segmenting L12-type nanoprecipitates from the matrix in an AlLiMg alloy, irrespective of crystallographic orientations, which outperforms previous methods. AtomNet also allows for 3D imaging of L10-type LCOs in an AuCu alloy, a challenging task for conventional analysis due to their small size and subtle compositional differences. Finally, we demonstrate the use of AtomNet for revealing 2D stacking faults in a Co-based superalloy, without any defected training data, expanding the capabilities of APT for automated exploration of hidden microstructures. AtomNet pushes the boundaries of APT analysis, and holds promise in establishing precise quantitative microstructure-property relationships across a diverse range of metallic materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and extrinsic plasmons in the hard x-ray photoelectron spectra of nearly free electron metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective plasmon excitations in solids that result from the process of photoemission are an important area of fundamental research. In this study, we identify a significant number ($n$) of multiple bulk plasmons ($n\omega_p$) in the hard x-ray photoelectron spectra of the core levels and valence bands (VBs) of two well-known, nearly free electron metals, aluminum (Al) and magnesium (Mg). On the basis of earlier theoretical works, we estimate the contributions of extrinsic, intrinsic, and interference processes to the intensities of 1$s$ to 2$s$ core level plasmons. The intrinsic contribution diminishes from 22% for 1$\omega_p$, to 4.4% for 2$\omega_p$, and becomes negligible thereafter (0.5% for 3$\omega_p$). The extrinsic and intrinsic plasmon contributions do not vary significantly across a broad range of photoelectron kinetic energies, and also between the two metals (Al and Mg). The interference contribution varies from negative to zero as $n$ increases. An asymmetric line shape is observed for the bulk plasmons, which is most pronounced for 1$\omega_p$. Signature of the surface plasmon is detected in normal emission, and it exhibits a significantly increased intensity in the grazing emission. The VB spectra of Al and Mg, which are dominated by $s$-like states, exhibit excellent agreement with the calculated VB based on density functional theory. The VB exhibits four multiple bulk plasmon peaks in the loss region, which are influenced by an intrinsic process in addition to the extrinsic process. On a completely oxidized aluminum surface, the relative intensity of the Al metal bulk plasmon remains nearly unaltered, while the surface plasmon is completely attenuated.</description>

      <title>Log-normal glide and the formation of misfit dislocation networks in heteroepitaxial ZnS on GaP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) is used to observe and quantify misfit dislocation (MD) networks formed at the heteroepitaxial interface between ZnS and GaP grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Below a critical thickness of 15-20 nm, no MDs are observed. However, crystallographic features with strong dipole contrast, consistent with unexpanded dislocation half-loops, are observed prior to the formation of visible interfacial MD segments and any notable strain relaxation. At higher film thicknesses (20 to 50 nm), interfacial MD lengths increase anisotropically in the two orthogonal in-plane &lt;110&gt; line directions, threading dislocation (TD) density increases, and a roughening transition is observed from atomically smooth two-dimensional (2D) to a multi-stepped three-dimensional (3D) morphology, providing evidence for step edge pinning via surface terminating dislocations. The ZnS strain relaxation, calculated from the total MD content observed via ECCI, matches the average strain relaxation measured by high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD). The MD lengths are found to follow a log-normal distribution, indicating that the combined MD nucleation and TD glide processes must have a normal distribution of activation energies. The estimated TD glide velocity ($v_{g}$) along [$\bar{1}$10] is almost twice that along [110], but in both directions shows a maximum as a function of film thickness, indicating an initial burst of plasticity followed by dislocation pinning.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen energy is a high-efficiency and clean energy. Large-surface-area, two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are expected to have an advantage in hydrogen storage applications. Among a large number of 2D materials, monolayer dichacogenides have emerged as promising candidate for hydrogen clean energy. In the present work, first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to investigate the adsorption behaviors of hydrogen molecules on transition metal dichalcogenides and disulphides. Furthermore we propose novel structures which may suitable for hydrogen storage. As the concentration increaes, 2D shows thermodynamic stability even at room temperature, suggesting a possible aplicability for hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Realisation of de Gennes$'$ Absolute Superconducting Switch with a Heavy Metal Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1966, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes proposed a non-volatile mechanism for switching superconductivity on and off in a magnetic device. This involved a superconductor (S) sandwiched between ferromagnetic (F) insulators in which the net magnetic exchange field could be controlled through the magnetisation-orientation of the F layers. Because superconducting switches are attractive for a range of applications, extensive studies have been carried out on $F/S/F$ structures. Although these have demonstrated a sensitivity of the superconducting critical temperature ($T_{c}$) to parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetisation-orientations of the F layers, corresponding shifts in $T_c$ (i.e., ${\Delta}T_c = T_{c,AP} - T_{c,P}$) are lower than predicted with ${\Delta}T_c$ only a small fraction of $T_{c,AP}$, precluding the development of applications. Here, we report $EuS/Au/Nb/EuS$ structures where EuS is an insulating ferromagnet, Nb is a superconductor and Au is a heavy metal. For P magnetisations, the superconducting state in this structure is quenched down to the lowest measured temperature of 20 mK meaning that ${\Delta}T_c/T_{c,AP}$ is practically 1. The key to this so-called absolute switching effect is a sizable spin-mixing conductance at the $EuS/Au$ interface which ensures a robust magnetic proximity effect, unlocking the potential of $F/S/F$ switches for low power electronics.</description>

      <title>True random number generation using metastable 1T' molybdenum ditelluride</title>

Abstract: True random numbers play a critical role in secure cryptography. The generation relies on a stable and readily extractable entropy source. Here, from solution-processed structurally metastable 1T' MoTe2, we prove stable output of featureless, stochastic, and yet stable conductance noise at a broad temperature (down to 15 K) with minimal power consumption (down to 0.05 micro-W). Our characterizations and statistical analysis of the characteristics of the conductance noise suggest that the noise arises from the volatility of the stochastic polarization of the underlying ferroelectric dipoles in the 1T' MoTe2. Further, as proved in our experiments and indicated by our Monte Carlo simulation, the ferroelectric dipole polarization is a reliable entropy source with the stochastic polarization persistent and stable over time. Exploiting the conductance noise, we achieve the generation of true random numbers and demonstrate their use in common cryptographic applications, for example, password generation and data encryption. Besides, particularly, we show a privacy safeguarding approach to sensitive data that can be critical for the cryptography of neural networks. We believe our work will bring insights into the understanding of the metastable 1T' MoTe2 and, more importantly, underpin its great potential in secure cryptography.</description>

      <title>Imaging Tunable Luttinger Liquid Systems in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) interacting electrons are often described as a Luttinger liquid1-4 having properties that are intrinsically different from Fermi liquids in higher dimensions5,6. 1D electrons in materials systems exhibit exotic quantum phenomena that can be tuned by both intra- and inter-1D-chain electronic interactions, but their experimental characterization can be challenging. Here we demonstrate that layer-stacking domain walls (DWs) in van der Waals heterostructures form a broadly tunable Luttinger liquid system including both isolated and coupled arrays. We have imaged the evolution of DW Luttinger liquids under different interaction regimes tuned by electron density using a novel scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) technique. Single DWs at low carrier density are highly susceptible to Wigner crystallization consistent with a spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, while at intermediate densities dimerized Wigner crystals form due to an enhanced magneto-elastic coupling. Periodic arrays of DWs exhibit an interplay between intra- and inter-chain interactions that gives rise to new quantum phases. At low electron densities inter-chain interactions are dominant and induce a 2D electron crystal composed of phased-locked 1D Wigner crystal in a staggered configuration. Increased electron density causes intra-chain fluctuation potentials to dominate, leading to an electronic smectic liquid crystal phase where electrons are ordered with algebraical correlation decay along the chain direction but disordered between chains. Our work shows that layer-stacking DWs in 2D heterostructures offers new opportunities to explore Luttinger liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Quantification of 2D Interfaces: Quality of heterostructures, and what is inside a nanobubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped materials at the interfaces of two-dimensional heterostructures (HS) lead to reduced coupling between the layers, resulting in degraded optoelectronic performance and device variability. Further, nanobubbles can form at the interface during transfer or after annealing. The question of what is inside a nanobubble, i.e. the trapped material, remains unanswered, limiting the studies and applications of these nanobubble systems. In this work, we report two key advances. Firstly, we quantify the interface quality using RAW-format optical imaging, and distinguish between ideal and non-ideal interfaces. The HS-substrate ratio value is calculated using a transfer matrix model, and is able to detect the presence of trapped layers. The second key advance is identification of water as the trapped material inside a nanobubble. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that optical imaging alone can quantify interface quality, and find the type of trapped material inside spontaneously formed nanobubbles. We also define a quality index parameter to quantify the interface quality of HS. Quantitative measurement of the interface will help answer the question whether annealing is necessary during HS preparation, and will enable creation of complex HS with small twist angles. Identification of the trapped materials will pave the way towards using nanobubbles for novel optical and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>In Situ Characterisation of Graphene Growth on Liquid Copper-Gallium Alloys: Paving the Path for Cost-Effective Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid metal catalysts (LMCats), primarily molten copper, have demonstrated their efficiency in the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach for synthesising high-quality, large-area graphene. However, their high melting temperatures limit broader applications. Reducing the temperature of graphene production on LMCats would lead to a more efficient and cost-effective process. Here, we investigated the effects of alloying copper with a low-melting temperature metal on graphene growth in real-time. We examined a set of liquid copper-gallium alloy systems using two complementary in situ techniques: radiation-mode optical microscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR). Microscopy observations revealed reduced catalytic activity and graphene quality degradation in compositions with gallium domination. The XRR confirmed the formation of single-layer graphene on alloys with up to 60 wt% of gallium. Additionally, we detected a systematic increase in adsorption height on the alloys' surface, suggesting a weaker graphene adhesion on gallium. These findings propose a trade-off between layer quality and production cost reduction is feasible. Our results offer insights into the CVD synthesis of graphene on bimetallic liquid surfaces and underscore the potential of gallium-copper alloys for enabling the direct transfer of graphene from a liquid substrate, thereby addressing the limitations imposed by high melting temperatures of conventional LMCats.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanocrystal superlattice self-assembly near a metastable liquid binodal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear electric dipoles in a polar, chiral phase of CsSnBr$_3$ perovskite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar and chiral crystal symmetries confer a variety of potentially useful functionalities upon solids by coupling otherwise noninteracting mechanical, electronic, optical, and magnetic degrees of freedom. We describe two unstudied phases of the 3D perovskite, CsSnBr$_3$, which emerge below 85 K due to the formation of Sn(II) lone pairs and their interaction with extant octahedral tilts. Phase II (77 K&lt;$T$&lt;85 K, space group $P2_1/m$) exhibits ferroaxial order driven by a noncollinear pattern of lone pair-driven distortions within the plane normal to the unique octahedral tilt axis, preserving the inversion symmetry observed at higher temperatures. Phase I ($T$&lt;77 K, space group $P2_1$) additionally exhibits ferroelectric order due to distortions along the unique tilt axis, breaking both inversion and mirror symmetries. This polar and chiral phase exhibits second harmonic generation from the bulk and a large, intrinsic polarization$-$electrostriction coefficient along the polar axis ($Q_{22}\approx$1.1 m$^4$ C$^{-2}$), resulting in acute negative thermal expansion ($\alpha_V=-9\times10^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$) through the onset of spontaneous polarization. The unprecedented structures of phases I and II were predicted by recursively following harmonic phonon instabilities to generate a tree of candidate structures and subsequently corroborated by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and polarized Raman and $^{81}$Br nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopies. Relativistic electronic structure scenarios compatible with reported photoluminescence measurements are discussed. Together, the polar symmetry, small bandgap, large spin-orbit splitting of Sn 5$p$ orbitals, and predicted strain sensitivity of the symmetry-breaking distortions suggest bulk samples and epitaxial films of CsSnBr$_3$ or its neighboring solid solutions as strong candidates for bulk Rashba effects.</description>

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in understanding and engineering heat transport properties of complex materials. An essential requirement for reliably predicting heat transport properties is the use of accurate and efficient interatomic potentials. Recently, machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have shown great promise in providing the required accuracy for a broad range of materials. In this mini review and tutorial, we delve into the fundamentals of heat transport, explore pertinent MD simulation methods, and survey the applications of MLPs in MD simulations of heat transport. Furthermore, we provide a step-by-step tutorial on developing MLPs for highly efficient and predictive heat transport simulations, utilizing the neuroevolution potentials (NEPs) as implemented in the GPUMD package. Our aim with this mini review and tutorial is to empower researchers with valuable insights into cutting-edge methodologies that can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MD simulations for heat transport studies.</description>

      <title>Bulk and Interface Effects Based on Rashba-Like States in Ti and Ru Nanoscale-Thick Films: Implications for Orbital-Charge Conversion in Spintronic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, employing spin-pumping techniques driven by both ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) and longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) to manipulate and direct observe orbital currents, we investigated the volume conversion of spin-orbital currents into charge-current in YIG(100nm)/Pt(2nm)/NM2 structures, where NM2 represents Ti or Ru. While the YIG/Ti bilayer displayed a negligible SP-FMR signal, the YIG/Pt/Ti structure exhibited a significantly stronger signal attributed to the orbital Hall effect of Ti. Substituting the Ti layer with Ru revealed a similar phenomenon, wherein the effect is ascribed to the combined action of both spin and orbital Hall effects. Furthermore, we measured the SP-FMR signal in the YIG/Pt(2)/Ru(6)/Ti(6) and YIG/Pt(2)/Ti(6)/Ru(6) heterostructures by just altering the stack order of Ti and Ru layers, where the peak value of the spin pumping signal is larger for the first sample. To verify the influence on the oxidation of Ti and Ru films, we studied a series of thin films subjected to controlled and natural oxidation. As Cu and CuOx is a system that is already known to be highly influenced by oxidation, this metal was chosen to carry out this study. We investigated these samples using SP-FMR in YIG/Pt(2)/CuOx(tCu) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy and concluded that samples with natural oxidation of Cu exhibit more significant results than those when the CuOx is obtained by reactive sputtering. In particular, samples where the Cu layer is naturally oxidized exhibit a Cu2O-rich phase. Our findings help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the inverse orbital Hall and inverse orbital Rashba-Edelstein-like effects. These insights indeed contribute to the advancement of devices that rely on orbital-charge conversion.</description>

Abstract: Crystallographic twinning dynamics exhibit nanoscale force fluctuations that, when probed by dynamic force spectroscopy, reveal the underlying interactions within the lattice. We explore twinning in single crystalline titanium nickel, a type of lattice instability mediated by a martensitic phase transition, which creates mirror planes in the lattice. Exploiting the responses generated under imposed strain ramps, we show that the dynamic force spectra of the twinning rate process across various applied strain rates can be reconciled using a statistical mechanics-based framework, demonstrating a more effective utilisation of stochastic responses. The twinning mechanism is mapped onto a free energy landscape to model the microscopic evolution of atomic configurations under imposed time-dependent deformation. The framework enables consistent inference of the relevant fundamental properties that define the structural transition rate process. The study demonstrates how the statistical characterisation of nanomechanical response-stimulus patterns can offer microscopic insights into the deformation behaviours of crystalline materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Induced magnetic order in a topological insulator (TI) can be realized either by depositing magnetic adatoms on the surface of a TI or engineering the interface with epitaxial thin film or stacked assembly of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials. Herein, we report the observation of spin-phonon coupling in the otherwise non-magnetic TI Bi$_\mathrm{2}$Te$_\mathrm{3}$, due to the proximity of FePS$_\mathrm{3}$ (an antiferromagnet (AFM), $T_\mathrm{N}$ $\sim$ 120 K), in a vdW heterostructure framework. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic studies reveal deviation from the usual phonon anharmonicity originated from spin-lattice coupling at the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/FePS$_{3}$ interface at/below 60 K in the peak position (self-energy) and linewidth (lifetime) of the characteristic phonon modes of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ (106 cm$^{-1}$ and 138 cm$^{-1}$) in the stacked heterostructure. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) formalism, where the respective phonon frequencies of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ couple to phonons of similar frequencies of FePS$_{3}$ in the AFM phase, has been adopted to understand the origin of the hybrid magneto-elastic modes. At the same time, the reduction of characteristic $T_\mathrm{N}$ of FePS$_3$ from 120 K in isolated flakes to 65 K in the heterostructure, possibly due to the interfacial strain, which leads to smaller Fe-S-Fe bond angles as corroborated by computational studies using density functional theory (DFT). Besides, inserting hexagonal boron nitride within Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/FePS$_{3}$ stacking regains the anharmonicity in Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. Controlling interfacial spin-phonon coupling in stacked heterostructure can have potential application in surface code spin logic devices.</description>

      <title>Mpemba meets Newton: Exploring the Mpemba and Kovacs effects in the time-delayed cooling law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research, the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the Mpemba effect, a phenomenon where a substance cools faster after initially being heated, remain elusive. Although historically linked with water, the Mpemba effect manifests across diverse systems, sparking heightened interest in Mpemba-like phenomena. Concurrently, the Kovacs effect, a memory phenomenon observed in materials like polymers, involves rapid quenching and subsequent temperature changes, resulting in nonmonotonic relaxation behavior. This paper probes the intricacies of the Mpemba and Kovacs effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling, recognized as a simplistic yet effective phenomenological model accommodating memory phenomena. This law allows for a nuanced comprehension of temperature variations, introducing a time delay ($\tau$) and incorporating specific protocols for the thermal bath temperature, contingent on a defined waiting time ($t_{\text{w}}$). Remarkably, the relevant parameter space is two-dimensional ($\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$), with bath temperatures exerting no influence on the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect or the relative strength of the Kovacs effect. The findings enhance our understanding of these memory phenomena, providing valuable insights applicable to researchers across diverse fields, ranging from physics to materials science.</description>

      <title>Competing anisotropies in the chiral cubic magnet Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ unveiled by resonant x-ray magnetic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cubic $\beta$-Mn-type alloy Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ is a chiral helimagnet that exhibits a peculiar temperature-dependent behavior in the spiral pitch, which decreases from 130 nm at room temperature to 70 nm below 20 K. Notably, this shortening is also accompanied by a structural transition of the metastable skyrmion texture, transforming from a hexagonal lattice to a square lattice of elongated skyrmions. The underlying mechanism of these transformations remain unknown, with interactions potentially involved including temperature-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and exchange anisotropy. Here, x-ray resonant magnetic small-angle scattering in vectorial magnetic fields was employed to investigate the temperature dependence of the anisotropic properties of the helical phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. Our results reveal quantitatively that the magnitude of the anisotropic exchange interaction increases by a factor of 4 on cooling from room temperature to 20 K, leading to a 5% variation in the helical pitch within the (001) plane at 20 K. While anisotropic exchange interaction contributes to the shortening of the spiral pitch, its magnitude is insufficient to explain the variation in the spiral periodicity from room to low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that magnetocrystalline and exchange anisotropies compete, favoring different orientations of the helical vector in the ground state.</description>
