      <title>Variable X-ray Emission of the Planet Hosting T Tauri Star CI Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of Chandra X-ray observations of CI Tau, a young magnetically active classical T Tauri star for which previous studies have reported periodic variability attributed to a massive planet in a short-period orbit. CI Tau was clearly detected by Chandra in four separate observations acquired in late 2023. The X-ray emission was steady in the first two observations with a characteristic plasma temperature kT ~ 2 keV (~23 MK) and X-ray luminosity log Lx = 29.74 erg/s. During each of the last two observations obtained two weeks later the count rate increased slowly and the X-ray plasma temperature was much higher but remained nearly steady at kT ~ 4 - 5 keV (~46 - 58 MK) and peak luminosity log Lx = 30.5 erg/s. Such variable X-ray emission in T Tauri stars accompanied by high plasma temperatures is a signature of magnetic activity, consistent with the known presence of a strong magnetic field in CI Tau. We summarize the variable X-ray emission properties of CI Tau within the framework of T Tauri stars of similar mid-K spectral type, identify possible variability mechanisms, and assess the effects of stellar X-ray irradiation on the claimed planet.</description>

      <title>Validating the 1D-3D coupling stellar models via Asteroseismology of 18 Kepler main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard 1D stellar evolution model has poor descriptions of the near-surface layers of stars, and this can be improved by using the atmosphere model computed from 3D hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we validated the model inferences of the 1D-3D coupling models using 18 well-studied stars from the Kepler LEGACY Sample. We compared our estimates of the fundamental parameters determined with other six pipelines and obtained good consistency. The results indicate that the 1D-3D coupling models can be applied to characterizing solar-like stars with confidence. Our analysis showed similar pattern for the surface term in stars with effective temperature range from ~5000 K to ~6400 K, suggesting that the surface term of the 1D-3D coupling models is simpler and easier to deal with than that of models using classical atmosphere.</description>

      <title>A tale of three tails: A misaligned streamer and mysterious structures around [BHB2007]1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of streamer-like structures around protostellar sources challenge the traditional picture of isolated, axisymmetric star formation. Here, we present new ALMA observations of [BHB2007]1, a flat-spectrum source connected to at least three such elongated structures. Two of these features are symmetrically located to the north and south of the disk, with velocities aligned with the disk on their respective sides. However, their unbound kinematics and curved morphology make it difficult to determine their origin. Possible explanations include outflows, interactions with the nearby BHB2 system, and hyperbolic infall, but none fully account for all observed properties. In contrast, a newly identified collimated structure to the west shows clear evidence of gravitationally bound infall. Estimates of its mass, mass infall rate, and angular momentum suggest that this infalling streamer would roughly double the mass budget available to form planets and tilt the disk by a few tens of degrees. Furthermore, its misalignment with the midplane of the disk and the lack of diffuse envelope emission indicate that the streamer may have formed due to gravitational capture of cloud material unrelated to the source's natal core. Together, these findings support a more dynamic picture of star formation, one where environmental interactions continue to shape conditions for building planetary systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decades of efforts, optical long-baseline interferometry has become a mainstream observational technique in terms of operation robustness and user friendliness. Interferometry has opened a new observational window, enabling (sub)au-scale resolution of massive stars and direct measurements of orbital parameters, wind structures, and magnetic phenomena. This paper reviews recent advances in interferometric studies of massive stars, focusing on multiplicity, magnetism, and stellar winds.</description>

      <title>Ubiquity of Methanol and its related Chemical Segregation in Orion Starless Cores: the ALMASOP Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) in starless cores provide critical insights into the early stages of star formation and prebiotic chemistry. We present a chemical survey of 16 starless cores (including five prestellar cores) in the Orion A and B molecular clouds, targeting CH3OH, N2H+, CCS, and c-C3HD, using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and the Yebes 40-m telescope. CH3OH was detected toward all targets, confirming its ubiquity in starless cores, consistent with previous surveys in Taurus and Perseus. ACA imaging shows that CH3OH, CCS, and c-C3HD generally trace the outer layers of the dense cores outlined by N2H+, each exhibiting distinct spatial distributions. Meanwhile, Comparison with Yebes data reveals an extended, flattened CH3OH component. CCS and c-C3HD tend to be detected or non-detected together across cores, while cores near dust-rich regions on a large scale often lack both, suggesting environmental influences linked to the interstellar radiation field. Within individual cores, CCS typically resides in an outer layer relative to c-C3HD. Our findings underscore the importance of high-resolution studies for understanding the origins and spatial differentiation of COMs and carbon-chain molecules in cold, quiescent environments.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Flare Ribbon Bead-like Structures in a Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present fast cadence and high resolution observations of flare ribbons from the Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). Utilizing the short-exposure observations from the EUI High Resolution Imager in EUV (HRIEUV), we find small-scale blob/bead-like kernel structures propagating within a hook at the end of a flare ribbon, during the impulsive phase of a C9.9-class solar flare. These bead structures are dynamic, with well-resolved spatial separations as low as ~420-840 kilometers (3-6 pixels) - below the observable limit of full-disk solar imagers. We analyze the evolution of the plane-of-sky apparent velocity and separation of the flare ribbon structures, finding evidence for multiple processes occurring simultaneously within the flare ribbon. These processes include - quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP)-like brightenings, slow back-and-forth zig-zag motions along the ribbon, rapid apparent motions along the ribbon (600+ km/s), and stationary blob-like structures. Finally, we conduct Fast Fourier Transform analysis and analyze the start times of exponential growth in the power spectrum at different spatial scales across the flare ribbon. Our analysis reveals that the ribbon beads form with a key spatial separation of 1.7-1.9 Mm, before developing into more complex structures at progressively larger and smaller spatial scales. This observation is consistent with predictions of the tearing mode instability.</description>

      <title>SMSS J022423.27$-$573705.1: An Extremely Metal-Poor Star with the Most Pronounced Weak $r$-Process Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the measurement of 26 elemental abundances of SMSS J022423.27$-$573705.1 (SMSS 0224$-$5737), an extremely metal-poor (EMP) star with a weak $r$-process signature. We report the measurements of N, O, V, Zn, and Ba, and the upper limits for Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, and Eu for the first time. SMSS 0224$-$5737 exhibits low C abundance and high N and O abundances suggesting that C is converted to N by the enhanced mixing during the evolution. The abundance pattern up to the Fe-peak elements is generally in good agreement with the average abundance of EMP stars, although a notable feature is the high [Zn/Fe] ratio ([Zn/Fe] $= +0.88$). We confirm the enhancement of the first-peak neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Zr) and determine a low Ba abundance [Ba/H] $= -5.25$, that is, [Ba/Fe] $= -1.45$. The extremely high ratio of [Zr/Ba] $= +2.60$ makes SMSS 0224$-$5737 the EMP star with the most pronounced weak $r$-process signature observed to date. The abundance pattern of the neutron-capture elements is compared with the yields from $r$-process nucleosynthesis models. The sharp decline in abundances beyond Zr disfavors neutron star merger or electron-capture supernova models, but are reproduced either by proto-neutron star wind models or by magneto-rotational supernova models. Considering the high [Zn/Fe] ratio, a magneto-rotational supernova is the most plausible origin of SMSS 0224$-$5737. This study demonstrates that the abundance measurements of both light and neutron-capture elements, even at low abundances, are crucial for unveiling the astrophysical sites of the weak $r$-process.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic detection of a predominantly toroidal magnetic field in the deep interior of the main-sequence F star KIC 9244992</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An asteroseismic analysis has revealed a magnetic field in the deep interior of a slowly-rotating main-sequence F star KIC9244992, which was observed by the Kepler spacecraft for four years. The star shows clear asymmetry of frequency splittings of high-order dipolar gravity modes, which cannot be explained by rotation alone, but are fully consistent with a model with rotation, a magnetic field and a discontinuous structure (glitch). Careful examination of the frequency dependence of the asymmetry allows us to put constraints on not only the radial component of the magnetic field, but also its azimuthal (toroidal) component. The lower bounds of the root-mean-squares of the radial and azimuthal components in the radiative region within 50 per cent in radius, which have the highest sensitivity in the layers just outside the convective core with a steep gradient of chemical compositions, are estimated to be $\mathsf{B}_{\mathrm{r}}^{\min}=3.5 \pm 0.1$ kG and $\mathsf{B}_{\phi}^{\min}=92 \pm 7$ kG, respectively. The much stronger azimuthal component than the radial one is consistent with the significant contribution of the differential rotation although the star has almost uniform rotation at present. The estimated field strengths are too strong to be explained by dynamo mechanisms in the radiative zone associated with the magnetic Tayler instability. The aspherical glitch is found to be located in the innermost radiative layers where there is a steep gradient of chemical composition. The first detection of magnetic fields in the deep interior of a main-sequence star sheds new light on the problem of stellar magnetism, for which there remain many uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Starspots and Flares are Generally Not Correlated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots and solar flares are two different manifestations of magnetic activity on the surface of the Sun. On the Sun, flares typically occur close to spots. In this paper we test this the connection between spots and flares on other stars. We detect 218,386 stellar flares on 14,163 spotted stars using a new algorithm called \textsc{toffee}. Inhomogeneous spot distributions mean that as stars rotate they become brighter when less spots are facing the observer, and dimmer when more spots are facing the observer. We determine that flares occur when the star is brighter $49.97\pm 0.21\%$ of the time, i.e. there is an equal preference for the flares to occur when the star is relatively bright or dim. We therefore find no evidence for a correlation between flare rate and spot occurrence, contrary to what is seen on the Sun.</description>

      <title>The 2023 Australian Total Solar Eclipse: Line Emission of Fe XIV, Fe X and Fe XI out to 6 solar radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present narrowband observations of the Fe XIV (530.3 nm), Fe X (637.4 nm), and Fe XI (789.2 nm) coronal emission lines from the 2023 April 20 Total Solar Eclipse in Australia. We deployed pairs of telescopes for each emission line that were equipped with narrowband filters centered on, and several nanometers away from, the center wavelengths of the lines. The secondary continuum telescopes were used to measure and remove the combined continuum K- (electron) and F- (dust) corona, which dominate coronal emission at optical and infrared wavelengths. Significant emission was detected from all three lines from 1.03 solar radii (Rs) continuously outward to at least 6 Rs. The brightness of the lines and continuum are absolutely calibrated to the solar disk, and are validated by a comparison with LASCO-C2 observations made at the same time. Using these observations, we inferred the line emission ratios resolved throughout the middle-corona (defined as 1.5 to 6 Rs) for the first time. These line ratios are a probe of the electron temperature, which have important implications for constraining models of coronal heating and the characterization of solar wind formation, yet these emission lines have scarcely been quantified beyond 3 Rs in the corona. This study demonstrates the enduring potential of eclipse observations for coronal physics and suggests that future spacecraft missions could observe these lines farther out than has been attempted previously.</description>

      <title>Relationship Between Major Stellar Physical Parameters and Normal Mode Frequencies in Accreting White Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) are the final fate of about 97\% of the stars in our galaxy, making them vital tracers of stellar history. A fraction of WDs exist in cataclysmic variable (CV) systems, accreting matter from a nearby companion star. A subset of CVs undergo episodic rapid mass transfer, termed dwarf novae (DNe) outbursts. Some accreting WDs exhibit near sinusoidal photometric variations, interpreted as $g$ mode pulsations. However, identifying pulsation modes in accreting WDs remains challenging due to the paucity of available observed modes. In this work, we present a comprehensive computation of the observable $g$ mode frequencies across a range of WD parameters, varying the WD mass, size of the newly accreted layer and core temperature. We also introduce a novel method for mode identification based on the time evolution of pulsation periods following an accretion episode. Our mode identification method does not rely on the direct detection of the consecutive radial mode orders, frequently required in isolated WDs. Moreover, this work improves upon our previous WD modeling efforts. We use a more realistic core temperature in addition to thermohaline mixing and element diffusion enabled during the accretion phase.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Elliptical-Cylindrical Flux Rope Models for ICME Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized elliptical cylindrical flux rope model for interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) that allows for a non zero poloidal component in the internal magnetic field. We introduce a two step reconstruction algorithm that decouples the geometric configuration from the magnetic field fitting in order to improve numerical stability and physical consistency. Applied to Parker Solar Probe data, the new radial poloidal model preserves the global flux rope geometry while achieving a substantially better fit to the internal magnetic field than the traditional radial model, offering a more accurate and realistic description of ICME structures.</description>

      <title>A sudden fine-scale bright kernel captured by Hi-C Flare during an M1.6-class solar flare's post-maximum phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On April 17, 2024, the third successful Hi-C sounding rocket flight, Hi-C Flare, recorded coronal images in Fe XXI 129 A emission from 11 MK plasma during the post-maximum phase of an M1.6-class solar flare, achieving unprecedented spatial (~300 km) and temporal (1.3 s) resolutions. The flare started at 21:55 UT, peaked at 22:08 UT, and lasted ~40 minutes. Hi-C observed for over five minutes (22:15:45 to 22:21:25), starting roughly eight minutes after flare maximum. A sudden compact bright burst - 875 +/- 25 km wide, lasting 90 +/- 1.3 s, displaying a plane-of-sky motion of ~50 km/s toward the loop apex, and splitting into two toward the end - occurs near the foot of some post-flare loops. Its size and brightness are reminiscent of flare-ribbon kernels during a flare's rapid rise phase, kernels marking sites of sudden heating and hot plasma upflow, making its occurrence during the late phase surprising. Such isolated brightenings in a flare's post-maximum phase are rare, and have not been previously reported. The kernel was detected in all SDO/AIA channels. Its 1600 A light curve peaked ~50 s earlier than its 131 A light curve, similar to that of flare-ribbon kernels, albeit with a smaller delay of ~25 s, during the impulsive phase of the flare. In SDO/HMI magnetograms, the kernel sits in unipolar positive magnetic flux near an embedded clump of negative flux. Although localized magnetic reconnection within the kernel (a microflare) cannot be ruled out for its cause, the observations favor the localized brightening being an isolated, exceptionally late flare-ribbon kernel, resulting from an exceptionally late burst of the flare's coronal reconnection.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations with the MURaM Code: the Emergence of Active Region 11158 and the X2.2 Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the application of the data-driven branch of the MURaM code to the extensively studied flare-productive active region 11158. We refine the hybrid model strategy, which was described in the earlier paper of this series, to model the emergence of the active region during 4 solar days starting shortly before 2011 February 11 and the eruption of an X2.2 flare on February 15. After 4 days of evolution, a major eruption of a magnetic flux rope occurs in the simulation at approximately 3 hours (3\% difference) before the real flare. The eruption leads to magnetic reconnection that contributes to bulk heating in the chromosphere and corona. The deposition of flare energy in the chromosphere causes strong condensations and evaporations, which fill hot post-flare loops and bright flare ribbons that exhibit separation and extension similar to the observed ribbon evolution. The synthesized soft X-ray flux corresponds to X class, which is close to the real event. The upward eruption of the flux rope leads to a piston-driven shock and horizontal expansion that exerts a strong downward impact on the lower atmosphere and generate an apparently fast-propagating chromospheric Moreton wave. We conclude that the data-driven radiative simulation of this active region can reproduce the key observational results of the real flare and demonstrate the great potential of this method for studying solar eruptions in a realistic corona environment.</description>

      <title>Resolving Interchange Reconnection Dynamics in a Fan-Spine-like Topology Observed by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interchange reconnection is believed to play a significant role in the production of solar jets and solar wind. However, the dynamics of interchange reconnection in the low corona might be more complex than recognized before in higher temporal and spatial resolutions. Using unprecedentedly high-resolution observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter, we analyze the dynamics of interchange reconnection in a small-scale fan-spine-like topology. Interchange reconnection that continuously occurs around the multi-null points of the fan-spine-like system exhibits a quasi-periodicity of ~200 s, nearly covering the entire evolution of this system. Continuous evolution and reversal of multiple current sheets are observed over time near the null point. These results reveal that the dynamics of interchange reconnection are likely modulated by the emerging magnetic structures, such as mini-filaments and emerging arcades. Moreover, a curtain-like feature with a width of 1.7 Mm is also observed near the interchange reconnection region and persistently generates outflows, which is similar to the separatrix curtain reported in the pseudo-streamer structure. This study not only demonstrates the complex and variable reconnection dynamics of interchange reconnection within small-scale fan-spine topology but also provides insights into the self-similarity of magnetic field configurations across multiple temporal and spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Mass transfer stability for AM CVn binaries with white dwarf donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double white dwarf binaries (DWDBs) with Helium components are progenitors to AM CVn binary systems. Their Galactic production rate may be given by the number of stably mass transferring DWDBs in the Milky Way. The theoretical criteria for stable mass transfer in DWDBs is calculated assuming that component white dwarfs are completely cold and degenerate. Respective fractions of surviving AM CVn and DWDB which merge are then calculated by applying this criteria to population synthesis estimates for Galactic DWDB. However, emerging observations of the local DWDB population suggest that Helium white dwarf (He WD) components are typically hot, and only partially degenerate when they begin mass transferring. Using recent numerical simulations of He WD donors in DWDBs, we qualitatively describe a temperature dependent stable mass transfer criteria for Galactic DWDBs. Mass transfer is even more stable than previously thought, or equivalently, DWDB mergers are even rarer. Realistic finite temperature treatments will deepen the dearth in observed AM CVn binaries compared to DWDB merger products.</description>

      <title>Velocity-space turbulent cascade in the near-Sun solar wind: first insights from the Parker Solar Probe mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In space plasmas, the rarity of collisions leads to complex structures in the velocity space where a turbulent cascade of the velocity distribution function fluctuations is thought to occur. Previous studies have explored this phenomenon using the Hermite decomposition of the ion velocity distribution function (VDF) in both magnetosheath data and numerical simulations. In this work, we investigate the Hermite spectrum of the ion VDFs measured by Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. We analyze a superalfv\'enic stream at a radial distances of $R \approx 28 R_{sun}$ and a subalfv\'enic at $R \approx 11 R_{sun}$, the former characterized by a prevalence of VDFs with suprathermal beams (also known as hammerhead). The Hermite analysis is also compared with various proxies of energization and dissipation, in order to establish a connection between turbulent cascades in real space and those in the velocity space. A qualitative agreement between the energization proxies and the Hermite analysis is observed. The results are suggestive of the presence of a dual cascade in real and velocity space.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Post-Red Supergiant binary system AFGL 4106 and its complex nebula with SPHERE/VLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We aim to characterize the physical and morphological properties of the binary system AFGL 4106, composed of two evolved massive stars. Understanding its mass-loss processes and circumstellar environment offers insight into the late stages of stellar evolution in massive binary systems. Methods: We obtained high-angular--resolution, high-contrast imaging using VLT/SPHERE with ZIMPOL (optical) and IRDIS (near-infrared) across multiple filters. We used aperture photometry to extract the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each star, and applied radiative transfer modelling to study the system and its surrounding dusty environment. Results: The observations resolve both components of the binary and unveil a complex, dusty nebula featuring asymmetric structures and cavities. SED fitting yields stellar temperatures of T$_1 = 6723\pm196$ K and T$_2 = 3394\pm264$ K, along with bolometric luminosities of L$_1 = (7.9 \pm 0.18) \times 10^4$ L$_\odot$ and L$_2 = (3.8 \pm 0.11) \times 10^4$ L$_\odot$. These values support the classification of the primary as being in a post-red supergiant (post-RSG) phase and the secondary as an active red supergiant (RSG). The luminosity ratio, combined with the inferred radii, indicates that both stars are at close yet distinct stages of their evolution. The binary is surrounded by an extended shell whose asymmetric morphology and large-scale features suggest interaction with the stellar winds and interstellar medium (ISM), and possibly the presence of a third, undetected companion. Conclusions: These observations provide the first resolved view of AFGL 4106's system and its dusty envelope. Our analysis sets constraints on the physical properties and evolutionary status of the system. This work contributes to understanding mass-loss processes in massive binaries and the shaping of nebulae around evolved stars.</description>

      <title>X-CME: From In Situ Flux-Rope Reconstruction to CME Propagation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasts of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) arrival times and impact geometry remain a major challenge for space-weather operations. Coronagraph-based techniques typically achieve mean absolute errors of order ten hours, while in situ measurements at L1 provide excellent magnetic-field information but only tens of minutes of warning. In this work we introduce X-CME, a framework that links in situ flux-rope reconstructions at intermediate heliocentric distances with a physics-based CME propagation model. The internal magnetic structure is obtained with an elliptical cylindrical, radial poloidal flux-rope model and embedded into a tapered torus CME geometry. The subsequent propagation is computed by solving a drag-based equation of motion in a Parker solar-wind background, including gravitational deceleration, self-similar expansion of the cross section, and an explicit calculation of the CME wetted area and swept area in the ecliptic plane. We apply X-CME to two events observed by the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft, respectively, and propagate the reconstructed structures to Earth and Mars. For both cases, the model reproduces the observed in situ signatures at L1 and predicts the CME arrival time at Earth with errors of a few hours (typically about 2-4 hours), while correctly distinguishing between central encounters and glancing blows. These results demonstrate that combining intermediate-distance magnetic reconstructions with a geometrically consistent propagation scheme can substantially improve CME arrival-time forecasts and impact assessment in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and Decade-long Photometric Observations of the Contact Binary V2790 Ori: Evidence for a Brown Dwarf Companion and a Solar-like Magnetic Activity Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 22 sets of light curves and one radial velocity curve for the W UMa-type total eclipse contact binary system V2790 Ori, derived by combining all available public photometric data, the photometric data in previous studies, and our own spectroscopic and decade-long photometric observations. Our simultaneous analysis of the light curves and radial velocity curve shows that V2790 Ori is a W-subtype contact binary with a mass ratio of $q = 0.322(\pm0.001)$ and a shallow contact degree of $14.8(\pm0.6)\%$. The orbital period analysis based on 445 eclipsing minima reveals a secular decrease at a rate of $\dot P = -3.18 (\pm 0.75) \times 10^{-8}\mathrm{d~yr^{-1}}$, superimposed with a cyclic variation with an amplitude of $A = 8.98 (\pm 2.19) \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{d}$ and a period of $ P_3 = 7.44 (\pm 0.52)~\mathrm{yr}$. The secular decrease is caused by AML via magnetic braking, while the cyclic period variation is explained by the light-travel time effect due to a third body, which is likely to be a brown dwarf. Furthermore, our analysis indicates a mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one at a rate of $1.22(\pm0.29) \times 10^{-8}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$. A model with a cool spot on each component was adopted to fit the O'Connell effect observed in the light curves. Since the O'Connell effect varies over time, we identified a solar-like magnetic activity cycle with a period of approximately 5.4 yr by analyzing the magnitude difference ($\Delta m$) at the two light maxima and the O'Connell effect ratio. In addition, evolutionary analysis suggests that V2790 Ori is a newly formed contact binary that evolved from a detached phase into the present contact configuration.</description>

      <title>Substellar Initial Mass Function of Trumpler 14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young, massive stellar clusters offer a prime setting to explore brown dwarf (BD) formation under high densities and intense UV radiation. Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on GeMS/GSAOI imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besancon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20% completeness limit found at 0.01 MSun. Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of alpha=0.14+-0.19 for masses between 0.01-0.2 MSun, and alpha=1.72+-0.04 for 0.2-4.5 MSun. The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the 0.03-1 MSun mass range is 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed 3-6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above 0.03 MSun form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses &lt; 0.03 MSun.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active region NOAA 14274 produced some of the strongest flares of Solar Cycle 25, including the X1.2 and X5.1 flares on 10 and 11 November 2025, respectively. We present the first large mosaic of speckle-restored images obtained with the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+) at the 1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope at the Observatorio del Teide in Iza\~na, Tenerife, Spain. The observations were obtained approximately 30 minutes before the onset of the X1.2 flare. The active region exhibited strongly curved penumbral filaments, sunspot rotation, and shear motions along the polarity inversion line (PIL), which led to a highly stressed magnetic field configuration that stored sufficient energy to release multiple M- and X-class flares. The first flare signatures appeared as small-scale brightenings, each with a width of a few tenths of an arcsecond, that trace penumbral filaments in the trailing sunspot.</description>

      <title>Predicted white-light solar flare emission from the F-CHROMA grid of models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of a solar flare's energy is thought to be released in the continuum. The optical continuum (white light) is of special interest due to the ability to observe it from the ground. We aim to investigate the prevalence of white-light (WL) emissions in simulations of purely electron beam-driven solar flares, what determines the occurrence of these enhancements, and the underlying causes. We utilized the F-CHROMA grid of flare simulations created using the radiative hydrodynamics code RADYN. We probed the spectral index, total energy, and low-energy cutoff to draw conclusions about their relationships to the white-light intensity. Furthermore, we calculated the 6684 {\AA} continuum intensities, the Balmer, and the Paschen ratios. Finally, we analyzed two particular cases, one with high 6684 {\AA} intensity and one with a large Balmer ratio, to determine the dominant mechanisms in these simulations. 33 of the 84 flares included in the F-CHROMA grid show white-light intensity enhancements that exceed 0.1% relative to the pre-flare level. We conclude that, with the parameters presented in the F-CHROMA grid, purely electron beam-driven simulations of solar flares are not able to reproduce observed WL enhancements, as the maximum enhancements in the grid are below 4%. The total energy (which is correlated with the maximum beam flux) is the main factor for deciding whether excess white-light emissions will be detectable. There is a linear relationship between the Balmer (and Paschen) ratio and the relative continuum increase. Both case studies show that during the time of maximum WL excess, hydrogen ionization and subsequent recombination in an optically thin medium is the dominant mechanism for WL continuum emission enhancements. Increased H$^-$ emission in the photosphere as a result of radiative backwarming becomes dominant during the declining phase of WL emissions in both case studies.</description>

      <title>Identification of new Galactic symbiotic stars with SALT - II. New discoveries and characterization of the sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the continuation of a systematic search for new southern Galactic symbiotic stars, selecting candidates from the SuperCOSMOS H$\alpha$ Survey and 2MASS. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) was used to confirm their symbiotic nature and to characterize the cool and hot components of the full sample, including systems from earlier work. We report 14 newly confirmed bona fide symbiotic stars and identify 6 additional strong candidates. Photometric variability was examined using our data and archival light curves from multiple all-sky surveys. Most systems are variable, with the majority showing periodic modulation consistent with orbital motion or pulsations. Possible photometric orbital periods are reported for 19 confirmed and 3 candidate systems, pending spectroscopic confirmation. Eight objects exhibit signs of outburst activity. In one of the systems, multiple brightenings occur at similar orbital phases, closely resembling the evolution of FN Sgr, a symbiotic binary with a magnetic white dwarf. The peculiar variability of another symbiotic star is best explained by dust-obscuration events. These results expand the census of Galactic symbiotic stars.</description>

      <title>Active chromospheric fibril singularity: Coordinated observations from Solar Orbiter, SST, and IRIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine structures of the solar chromosphere, driven by photospheric motions, play a crucial role in the dynamics of solar magnetic fields. Many have been already identified such as fibrils, filament feet, and arch filament systems. Still, high resolution observations show a wealth of structures that remain elusive. We have observed a puzzling, unprecedented chromospheric fibril singularity in close vicinity of a blow-out solar jet and a flaring loop. We aim to understand the magnetic nature of this singularity and the cause of its activity using coordinated high- resolution multi-wavelengths observations. We aligned datasets from Solar Orbiter, SST, IRIS, and SDO. We re-projected the Solar Orbiter datasets to match the perspective of the Earth-based instruments. We performed potential field extrapolations from Solar Orbiter/PHI data. We analysed the spatial and temporal evolution of the plasma structures and their link with the surface magnetic field. This leads us to derive a model and scenario for the observed structures which we explain in a general schematic representation. We have discovered a new feature, a singularity in the chromospheric fibril pattern. It is formed in a weak magnetic field corridor between two flux concentrations of equal sign, at the base of a vertically inverted-Y shape field line pattern. In this specific case some activity develops along the structure. Firstly a flaring loop at one end, secondly a blow-out jet at the other end, where a coronal null-point was present and associated with a chromospheric saddle point being located onto the fibril singularity. The observations sugge</description>

      <title>Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: Scalar versus pseudoscalar cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09141v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Research Note we present new gravity-darkening exponents ($\beta$) for several stellar evolution models from the ZAMS up to the giant phase. The models were computed using the MESA code (version 7385) for the composition $X = 0.70$ and $Z = 0.02$, adopting A09 opacities and a mixing length parameter of $\alpha_{\rm MLT} = 1.84$. Results were calculated using the triangle strategy, for initial stellar masses of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 $M_{\odot}$, and provide an update on previously available $\beta$ values that used older models.</description>

      <title>Astrometric view of companions in the inner dust cavities of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks with inner dust cavities (often referred to as "transition disks") are potential signposts of planet formation. We use Gaia astrometry to search for planetary and stellar companions in a sample of 98 transition disks, assessing the occurrence rate of such companions and their potential influence on cavity formation. For the 98 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), we compute Gaia proper motion anomalies which, together with the RUWE, identify companions with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.01$ at $\sim$0.1-30 au. We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M &gt; 30$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M &lt; 13$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

      <title>The sonic scale does not determine the core separation in turbulent molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the typical separation between cores in molecular clouds dominated by turbulence is determined by the sonic scale, the size scale at which the turbulent velocity dispersion equals the sound speed. In this work, we test this hypothesis using a suite of turbulent simulations with Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}=4$ and 8, and three turbulent forcing wavenumbers ($k_{\rm for}=2,4$ and 8). Dense cores are identified through dendrogram analysis of column density maps, and their separations are compared to the sonic scale measured from velocity structure functions. We find no statistical correlation between the core separation and the sonic scale nor with the driving scale. Instead, for each run, the core separation spans the entire range of values between these two scales. Our results indicate that fragmentation in turbulence-dominated clouds is not governed by an intrinsic scale in the turbulent cascade. This finding calls into question the use of the sonic scale as a predictive quantity in star formation theories and cautions against interpreting observational core spacings as evidence for universal turbulent fragmentation physics.</description>

      <title>Excitation of molecular hydrogen by cosmic-ray protons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays ($E\lesssim 1$ GeV) are responsible for the ionisation and heating of molecular clouds. While the role of supra-thermal electrons produced in the ionisation process in inducing excitation of the ambient gas (mostly molecular hydrogen) has been studied in detail, the role of primary cosmic-ray nuclei (protons and heavier nuclei) has been generally neglected. Here, we introduce, for the first time, cross sections for proton impact on H$_2$, calculated using the semi-classical implementation of the molecular convergent close-coupling method. Our findings show that proton-induced H$_2$ excitation is comparable in magnitude to that caused by electrons. We discuss the possible implications on the estimate of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from observations in the near-infrared domain and on the cosmic-ray-induced H$_2$ ultraviolet luminescence. We also derive a new approximated analytical parameterisation of the spectrum of secondary electrons that can be easily incorporated in numerical codes.</description>

      <title>Normal or transitional? The evolution and properties of two type Ia supernovae in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most precise cosmological distance indicators used to study the expansion history of the Universe. The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Thermal conduction and thermopower of inner crusts of magnetized neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the thermal conductivity and thermoelectric power (thermopower) of the inner crust of compact stars across a broad temperature-density domain relevant for proto-neutron stars, binary neutron-star mergers, and accreting neutron stars. The analysis covers the transition from a semi-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes temperatures above the melting threshold of the nuclear lattice, such that nuclei form a liquid. The transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-time approximation, fully incorporating the anisotropies generated by non-quantizing magnetic fields. Electron scattering rates include (i) dynamical screening of the electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation of QED, (ii) ion-ion correlations within a one-component plasma, and (iii) finite nuclear-size effects. As an additional refinement, we evaluate electron-neutron scattering induced by the coupling of electrons to the anomalous magnetic moment of free neutrons; this contribution is found to be subdominant throughout the parameter range explored. To assess the sensitivity of transport coefficients to the underlying microphysics, we perform calculations for several inner-crust compositions obtained from different nuclear interactions and many-body methods. Across most of the crust, variations in relaxation times and in the components of the anisotropic thermal-conductivity and thermopower tensors reach up to factors 3-4 and 1.5-2, respectively, with the exception of the region where pasta phases are expected. These results provide updated, composition-dependent microphysical inputs for dissipative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of warm neutron stars and post-merger remnants, where anisotropic heat and charge transport are of critical importance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Discovery: Validating TESS Candidates and Identifying Planets in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-precision photometry from NASA's Kepler and TESS missions has revolutionized exoplanet detection, enabling the discovery of over 5500 confirmed exoplanets via the transit method and around 10000 additional candidates awaiting validation. However, confirming these candidates as true planets demands meticulous vetting and follow-up observations, which hampers the discovery of exoplanets in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework trained on Kepler's catalog of confirmed exoplanets and false positives to accurately identify true planetary candidates. Our model uses transit properties, planetary characteristics, and host stellar parameters as training features. The optimized model achieved 83.9% accuracy in cross-validation. When applied to 3987 TESS candidates with complete observational data, the model identified 1595 new high-confidence planets and correctly recovered 86% (358/418) of all previously confirmed TESS exoplanets in a blinded validation test. Our analysis revealed 100 previously unrecognized multi-planet systems, including five systems--that host habitable-zone exoplanets. Additionally, we identified 15 more planets within the habitable zone of a single system, suggesting strong potential for liquid water stability under conservative planetary albedo assumptions. This work demonstrates that machine learning can accelerate exoplanet validation while maintaining scientific rigor. Our modular design enables direct adaptation to future photometric missions like PLATO or Earth 2.0.</description>

      <title>A robust empirical relationship between speed and turbulence energy in the near-Earth solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection between turbulence and solar-wind acceleration, long known in space physics, is further developed in this Letter by establishing a robust empirical law that relates the bulk-flow speed to the magnetohydrodynamic-scale fluctuation energy in the plasma. The model is based on analysis of twenty-five years of near-Earth observations by NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer. It provides a simple way to estimate turbulence energy from low-resolution speed data -- a practical approach that may be of utility when high-resolution measurements or advanced turbulence models are unavailable. Potential heliospheric applications include space-weather forecasting operations, remote imaging datasets, and energetic-particle transport models that require turbulence amplitudes to specify diffusion parameters.</description>

      <title>Egent: An Autonomous Agent for Equivalent Width Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Egent, an autonomous agent that combines classical multi-Voigt profile fitting with large language model (LLM) visual inspection and iterative refinement. The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware.</description>

      <title>Kratos-polrad: Novel GPU system for Monte-Carlo simulations with consistent polarization calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized radiation serves as a vital diagnostic tool in astrophysics, providing unique insights into magnetic field geometries, scattering processes, and three-dimensional structures in diverse astrophysical scenarios. To address these applications, we present Kratos-polrad, a novel GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code built upon the heterogeneous computing framework of Kratos, designed for self-consistent and efficient polarization calculations. It utlizes comprehensive treatment of Stokes parameters throughout photon propagation, featuring transforms the grain-lab frame transforms using quaternion algebra and consistent non-linear polarization extinction in cells, which are useful in modeling radiative transfer processes with scatterings by aligned dust grains. The code implements two-step polarimetry imaging that decouples Monte Carlo sampling of scattering physics from imaging geometry, enabling efficient synthesis maximizing the utilization of photon packets. Extensive validation against analytical solutions and established codes demonstrates accurate treatment of diverse polarization phenomena, including self-scattering polarization, dichroic extinction in aligned dust grains, and complex polarization patterns in twisted magnetic field configurations. By leveraging massive GPU parallelism, optimized memory access patterns, and analytical approaches for optically thick cells, Kratos-polrad achieves performance improvements of $\sim 10^{2}$ times compared to CPU-based methods, enabling previously prohibitive studies in polarimetric astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way stellar halo is twisted and doubly broken: insights from DESI DR2 Milky Way Survey observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using K giants from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Milky Way (MW) Survey, we measure the shape, orientation, radial profile, and density anisotropies of the MW stellar halo over 8 kpc$&lt;r_\mathrm{GC}&lt;200$ kpc. We identify a triaxial stellar halo (axes ratio $10:8:7$), 43 degrees tilted from the disk, showing two break radii at $\sim16$ kpc and $\sim76$ kpc, likely associated with Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), respectively. The inner stellar halo ($&lt;30$ kpc) is oblate and aligned with the disk, whereas the outer stellar halo becomes prolate and perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the Vast Polar Structure of MW satellites. The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region. We also find new observational evidence of the LMC collective density wake, by showing a break radius at $\sim$100 kpc in the northern Galactic cap with a clear density peak at 90 kpc. In the end, we found that more metal-poor halo stars are more radially extended. Our results provide important clues to the assembly and evolution of the MW stellar halo under the standard cosmic structure formation framework.</description>

      <title>The impact of Solar magnetic field configurations on the production of gamma rays at the Solar disk</title>

Abstract: The Sun produces a steady signal of high-energy gamma rays through interactions of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with its atmosphere. Observations with Fermi-LAT and HAWC have revealed a gamma-ray flux significantly higher than early theoretical predictions, with unexpected temporal and spectral features that suggest a crucial role of the solar magnetic field. In this work, we model GCR-induced gamma-ray emission at the solar disk using the CRPropa framework with realistic hadronic interactions, chromospheric density profiles, and several magnetic field configurations over the solar cycle. This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions. We find that the expected flux is slightly below current upper limits from IceCube.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a rich population of compact hub-filament systems in a single star-forming complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of 45 compact hub-filament systems (HFSs; median size $\sim$2.4 pc) in infrared-dark clouds (IRDCs) in the W33 complex, located at the junction of the Scutum and Norma spiral arms. Using {\it Spitzer} 8 and 24 micron, and unWISE 12 $\mu$m images, HFSs are identified as regions where three or more filaments converge onto a central hub, appearing as absorption features toward IRDCs. In each IRDC, HFSs mainly lie at the intersections of elongated substructures, associated with groups of protostars and lacking radio continuum emission. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis shows that protostars are closely associated with the HFSs, with protostellar core separations of $\leq$ 0.7 pc, indicating strong clustering within fragmented structures. The HFSs form two main groupings spanning 10--15 pc, with member separations of 1--3.3 pc. Around 65\% are tightly clustered ($&lt;$ 2 pc), exhibiting rich small-scale structures and emphasizing the uniqueness of the complex. MST analysis of ALMAGAL 1.38 mm continuum cores -- predominantly low-mass and embedded in ten HFSs -- reveals a median core separation of $\sim$0.03 pc. The protostellar spacing ($\sim$0.7 pc) significantly exceeds the thermal Jeans length ($\sim$0.08 pc for temperature $\sim$18 K and density $\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$), whereas the core spacing is smaller than the Jeans length, suggesting that thermal fragmentation may influence core formation but alone cannot explain the larger-scale protostellar distribution. All these findings together support a picture in which fragments of clouds/filaments form clumps hosting compact HFSs that facilitate efficient and clustered star formation, often yielding massive stars.</description>

      <title>Investigating Circumstellar Atomic Radiation-driven Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interactions between stars and their orbiting planets, driven by forces such as stellar radiation and gravity, play an essential role in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres and gas-rich debris discs. One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.</description>

      <title>The chemical diversity of giant-planet nurseries as revealed by ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the giant exoplanet occurrence rate peaking around stars of 1.5-2 solar masses, there is strong motivation to characterize the disks that set their formation conditions. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allow us to investigate both the availability of different molecules in disks and infer the radial distribution of elemental abundances, enabling us to make connections to exoplanet systems. Here we present a survey of six transition disks around young F-, A-, and B-type stars using ALMA. We find 13C18O, CS, SO, and H2CO in all six systems, as well as ten additional molecules in a subset of disks, including detections of H2S, 33SO, and CH3OCH3. Using these data, and literature data where available, we construct the first comprehensive picture of Herbig disk chemistry. We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O&gt;1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O&lt;1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks.</description>

      <title>A window for water-hydrogen demixing on warm metal-rich sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes represent the largest exoplanet demographic, yet their bulk compositions remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggested that only very cold planets, such as Uranus and Neptune, could experience stratification of volatiles in their envelopes, implying that the envelopes of warmer sub-Neptunes instead have fully-miscible compositions. Here, we present ATHENAIA, an interior-atmosphere composition inference framework we leverage to assess the potential for water-hydrogen demixing on the $T_{\mathrm{eq}}=350$ K planet TOI-270 d, and more broadly for warm sub-Neptunes, using radiative-convective atmosphere models coupled to interior models. We find that the higher temperatures at which hydrogen and water demix in water-rich environments, combined with the shallower adiabatic gradients of water-rich envelopes, open a window for demixing on sub-Neptunes with bulk envelope metallicities of $\sim 100$ to $700\times$ solar, compatible with TOI-270 d. Demixing is easier to achieve on more massive and colder planets, but still broadly affects warm (330 to 500 K) metal-rich sub-Neptunes. Therefore, combining atmosphere metallicities with models of fully-miscible envelopes may lead to underestimated bulk envelope metallicities and mass fractions. Further, our modeling of TOI-270 d's envelope and interior reveals that, for a typical internal energy budget $T_\mathrm{int}$ of 25 K, the envelope-mantle boundary conditions likely preclude the presence of a molten magma ocean. This work encourages a reconsideration of the current paradigm for linking sub-Neptune atmospheres to their interiors and motivates further evolutionary modeling describing the onset of metallicity gradients in sub-Neptune envelopes.</description>

      <title>Nested Sampling for ARIMA Model Selection in Astronomical Time-Series Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming era of large scale, high cadence astronomical surveys demands efficient and robust methods for time series analysis. ARIMA models provide a versatile parametric description of stochastic variability in this context. However, their practical use is limited by the challenge of selecting optimal model orders while avoiding overfitting. We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Extreme ultraviolet late-phase flares as observed by EVE and AIA on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase (ELP) flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal emissions minutes to hours after the main peak of the flare. This phase is all but negligible, and it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the solar cycle and what governs it. Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between May 2010 and May 2014 based on properties such as eruptivity, magnetic configuration, and late-phase duration, delay, and strength in order to understand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their behavior on a general scale. Methods. We primarily made use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as complementary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and to see if ELP flares differ from the general flare population. We quantified the criteria for ELP flare definition and determined the characteristics of the flares. Results. Our analysis shows that about 10\% of all flares with a GOES class $\geq$C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803). This percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares are considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their higher-energy counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations. The majority of this type of flare are confined (67%), more so than in the general flare population ($\geq$C5.0). There appears to be a (linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio of the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9, and exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Picoflares in the Quiet Solar Corona: Solar Orbiter Observations Halfway to the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the Sun led Eugene Parker to propose nanoflares as the basic energy-release units that heat the solar corona. Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny "campfires" that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU.
  We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior.
  These picoflares, spanning $10^{20}$--$10^{24}$ erg, were detected by the Solar Orbiter EUI Imager while the spacecraft was at 0.56 AU from the Sun. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.</description>

      <title>Variation of the disk thickness across ice bands: A method to determine ice abundances in highly inclined protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Formation of protostars and the launching of stellar core outflows with moving-mesh radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}&gt; 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}&gt;10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($&lt;0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Populations of tidal and pulsating variables in eclipsing binaries</title>

Abstract: In this work, we seek to characterise a large sample of 14377 main sequence eclipsing binaries in terms of their stellar, asteroseismic, and orbital properties. We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron-star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Parameter R$_{\rho}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and "fuzzy" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the parameter $R_{\rho}$, which allows one to explore in an approximate way the efficiency of semiconvection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning from $R_{\rho}=1$ (Ledoux) to $R_{\rho}=0$ (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower $R_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also broadly agree with the observed brunt frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.</description>
