      <title>The environment around young eruptive stars. SPHERE/IRDIS polarimetric imaging of 7 protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eruptive stars are a class of young stellar objects that show an abrupt increase in their luminosity. These burst-like episodes are thought to dominate the stellar accretion process during the class 0/class I stage. We present an overview of a survey of seven episodically accreting protostars aimed at studying their potentially complex circumstellar surroundings. The observations were performed with the instrument SPHERE, mounted at the VLT. We observed the eruptive stars in $H$-band with the near-infrared imager IRDIS and used the polarimeter to extract the polarized light scattered from the stars' surroundings. We produced polarized light images for three FUor objects, Z CMa, V960 Mon, and FU Ori, and four EXor objects, XZ Tau, UZ Tau, NY Ori, and EX Lup. We calculated the intrinsic polarization fraction for all the observed stars. In all systems we registered scattered light from around the primary star. FU Ori and V960 Mon are surrounded by complex structures including spiral-like features. In Z CMa, we detected a point source 0.7 arcsec to the northeast of the primary. Based on the astrometric measurements from archival Keck/NIRC2 data, we find this source to be a third member of the system. Further, Z CMa displays an outflow extending thousands of au. Unlike the other EXor objects in our sample, XZ Tau shows bright, extended scattered light structures, also associated with an outflow on a scale of hundreds of au. The other EXors show relatively faint disk-like structures in the immediate vicinity of the coronagraph. Asymmetric arms were only found around FUor objects, while faint disks seem to predominantly occur around EXors. Importantly, for Z CMa the detection of the faint extended structure questions previous interpretations of the system's dynamic state. The streamer which was associated with a fly-by object turned out to be part of a huge outflow extending 6000 au.</description>

      <title>Rotation at the Fully Convective Boundary: Insights from Wide WD + MS Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrochronology, a valuable tool for determining ages of low-mass stars where other techniques fail, relies on accurate calibration. We present a sample of 327 wide ($&gt;$$100$\,au) white dwarf + main sequence (WD + MS) binary systems. Total ages of WDs are computed using all-sky survey photometry, Gaia parallaxes, and current hydrogen atmosphere WD models. Using a magnetic braking law calibrated against open clusters, along with assumptions about initial conditions and angular momentum transport, we construct gyrochrones to predict the rotation periods of the MS stars. Both data and models show that, near the fully convective boundary, MS stars with WD ages up to 7.5\,Gyr experience a rotation period increase by up to a factor of $\approx$$3$ within a $&lt;50\,\mathrm{K}$ effective temperature range. We suggest that rapid braking at this boundary is driven by a sharp rise in the convective overturn timescale ($\tau_{\mathrm{cz}}$) caused by structural changes between partially and fully convective stars and the $^3 \textrm{He}$ instability occurring at this boundary. While the specific location in mass (or temperature) of this feature varies with model physics, we argue that its existence remains consistent. Stars along this feature exhibit rotation periods that can be mapped, within 1$\sigma$, to a range of gyrochrones spanning $\approx 6$\, Gyr. Due to current temperature errors ($\simeq$$50\,\mathrm{K}$), this implies that a measured rotation period cannot be uniquely associated to a single gyrochrone, implying that gyrochronology may not be feasible for M dwarfs very close to the fully convective boundary.</description>

      <title>Gaia's binary star renaissance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.</description>

      <title>$\beta$ Cephei pulsators in eclipsing binaries observed with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined strength of asteroseismology and empirical stellar basic parameter determinations for in-depth asteroseismic analysis of massive pulsators in eclipsing binaries shows great potential for treating the challenging and mysterious discrepancies between observations and models of stellar structure and evolution of massive stars. This paper compiles a comprehensive list of massive pulsators in eclipsing binary systems observed with TESS. The TESS light curves and Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of a sample of 8055 stars of spectral type B0--B3 were examined for eclipses and stellar pulsations and the ephemerides of the resulting sub-sample of massive pulsators in eclipsing binaries were computed. This sub-sample was also cross-matched with existing catalogues of massive pulsators. Until now, fewer than 30 $\beta$ Cep pulsators in eclipsing binaries have been reported in the literature. Here we announce a total of 78 pulsators of the $\beta$ Cephei type in eclipsing binaries, 59 of which are new discoveries. Forty-three are recognized as definite and 35 are candidate pulsators. Our sample of pulsating massive stars in eclipsing binaries allows for future asteroseismic modelling to better understand the internal mixing profile and to resolve the mass discrepancy in massive stars. We have already started follow-up of some of the most interesting candidates.</description>

      <title>Investigation of non-equilibrium ionization plasma during a giant flare of UX Arietis triggered with MAXI and observed with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detected a giant X-ray flare from the RS-CVn type binary star UX Ari using MAXI on 2020 August 17 and started a series of NICER observations 89 minutes later. For a week, the entire duration of the flare was covered with 32 snapshot observations including the rising phase. The X-ray luminosity reached 2$\times$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the entire energy release was $\sim 10^{38}$ erg in the 0.5--8.0~keV band. X-ray spectra characterized by continuum emission with lines of Fe XXV He$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ were obtained. We found that the temperature peaks before that of the flux, which suggests that the period of plasma formation in the magnetic flare loop was captured. Using the continuum information (temperature, flux, and their delay time), we estimated the flare loop size to be $\sim 3 \times 10^{11}$ cm and the peak electron density to be $\sim 4\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Furthermore, using the line ratio of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI, we investigated any potential indications of deviation from collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE). The X-ray spectra were consistent with CIE plasma throughout the flare, but the possibility of an ionizing plasma away from CIE was not rejected in the flux rising phase.</description>

      <title>Mass Flows in Expanding Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An expansion of cross-sectional area directly impacts the mass flow along a coronal loop, and significantly alters the radiative and hydrodynamic evolution of that loop as a result. Previous studies have found that an area expansion from chromosphere to corona significantly lengthens the cooling time of the corona, and appears to suppress draining from the corona. In this work, we examine the fluid dynamics to understand how the mass flow rate, the energy balance, and the cooling and draining timescales are affected by a non-uniform area. We find that in loops with moderate or large expansion (cross-sectional area expansion factors of 2, 3, 10, 30, 100 from photosphere to apex), impulsive heating, for either direct thermal heating or electron beam heating, induces a steady flow into the corona, so that the coronal density continues to rise during the cooling phase, whereas a uniform loop drains during the cooling phase. The induced upflow carries energy into the corona, balancing the losses from thermal conduction, and continues until thermal conduction weakens enough so that it can no longer support the radiative losses of the transition region (TR). As a result, the plasma cools primarily radiatively until the onset of catastrophic collapse. The speed and duration of the induced upflow both increase in proportion to the rate of area expansion. We argue that observations of blue-shifted spectral lines, therefore, could place a constraint on a loop's area expansion.</description>

      <title>Cepheids with giant companions. II. Spectroscopic confirmation of nine new double-lined binary systems composed of two Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Cepheids with giant companions are crucial for studying the physical properties of Cepheid variables, providing the best means to measure their masses. Systems composed of two Cepheids are even more important but to date, only one such system in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) was known. Our current aim is to increase the number of these systems tenfold and provide their basic characteristics. The final goal is to obtain the physical properties of the component Cepheids, including their masses and radii, and to learn about their evolution in the multiple systems, also revealing their origin. We started a spectroscopic monitoring of nine unresolved pairs of Cepheids from the OGLE catalog, to check if they are gravitationally bound. Two of these so-called double Cepheids are located in the LMC, five in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and two in the Milky Way (MW). We report the spectroscopic detection of binarity of all 9 of these double Cepheids with orbital periods from 2 to 18 years. This increases the number of known binary double (BIND) Cepheids from 1 to 10 and triples the number of all confirmed double-lined binary (SB2) Cepheids. For five BIND Cepheids disentangled pulsational light curves of the components show anti-correlated phase shifts due to orbital motion. We show the first empirical evidence that typical period-luminosity relations (PLRs) are rather binary Cepheid PLRs that include the companion's light. The statistics of pulsation period ratios of BIND Cepheids do not agree with those expected for pairs of the same-age Cepheids. These ratios together with the mass ratios far from unity suggest merger-origin of at least one component for about half of the systems. The SMC and MW objects are the first found in SB2 systems composed of giants in their host galaxies. The Milky Way BIND Cepheids are also the closest such systems, being located at about 11 and 26 kpc.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of Y dwarfs observed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of five Y dwarfs with three optical and near-infrared instruments at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias are reported. Deep images of the five targets and a low-resolution far-red optical spectrum for one of the targets were obtained. One of the Y dwarfs, WISE J173835+273258 (Y0), was clearly detected in the optical (z- and i-bands) and another, WISE J182831+265037 (Y2), was detected only in the z-band. We measured the colours of our targets and found that the z-J and i-z colours of the Y dwarfs are bluer than those of mid- and late-T dwarfs. This optical blueing has been predicted by models, but our data indicates that it is sharper and happens at temperatures about 150 K warmer than expected. Likely, the culprit is the K I resonance doublet, which weakens more abruptly in the T- to Y-type transition than expected. We show that the alkali resonance lines (Cs I and K I) are weaker in Y dwarfs than in T dwarfs; the far-red optical spectrum of WISE J173835+273258 is similar to that of late-T dwarfs, but with stronger methane and water features; and we noted the appearance of new absorption features that we propose could be due to hydrogen sulphide. The optical properties of Y dwarfs presented here pose new challenges to understanding grain sedimentation in extremely cool objects. The weakening of the very broad K I resonance doublet due to condensation in dust grains is more abrupt than theoretically anticipated. Consequently, the observed blueing of the z-J and i-z colours of Y dwarfs with respect to T dwarfs is more pronounced than predicted by models and could boost the potential of upcoming deep large-area optical surveys regarding their ability to detect extremely cool objects</description>

      <title>Formation of Polar Crown Filaments Magnetic Fields by Supergranular Helicity Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the magnetic fields of the polar crown filaments (PCFs) at high latitudes near polar regions of the Sun, we perform magnetofrictional numerical simulations on the long-term magnetic evolution of bipolar fields with roughly east-west polarity inversion lines (PILs) in a three-dimensional (3D) spherical wedge domain near polar regions. The Coriolis effect induced vortical motions at the boundaries of several supergranular cells inject magnetic helicity from the photospheric boundary into the solar atmosphere. Supergranular-scale helicity injection, transfer, and condensation produce strongly sheared magnetic fields. Magnetic reconnections at footpoints of the sheared fields produce magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) with helicity signs consistent with the observed Hemispheric Helicity Rule (HHR). The cross-sectional area of MFRs exhibits an uneven distribution, resembling a "foot-node-foot" periodic configuration. Experiments with different tilt directions of PILs indicate that the PCFs preferably form along PILs with the western end close to the polar region. The bending of PILs caused by supergranular flows, forming S-shape (Z-shape) PIL segments, promotes the formation of dextral (sinistral) MFRs. The realistic magnetic models we got can serve as starting points for the study of the plasma formation and eruption of PCFs.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope of irradiated disks: MUSE observations of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster. I. Sample presentation and ionization front sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model.
  We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>Imaging and spectroscopic observations of a confined solar filament eruption with two-stage evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar filament eruptions are often characterized by stepwise evolution due to the involvement of multiple mechanisms, such as magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and magnetic reconnection. In this article, we investigated a confined filament eruption with a distinct two-stage evolution by using the imaging and spectroscopic observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The eruption originated from a kinked filament thread that separated from an active region filament. In the first stage, the filament thread rose slowly and was obstructed due to flux pile-up in its front. This obstruction brought the filament thread into reconnection with a nearby loop-like structure, which enlarged the flux rope and changed its connectivity through the foot-point migration. The newly formed flux rope became more kink unstable and drove the rapid eruption in the second stage. It ascended into the upper atmosphere and initiated the reconnection with the overlying field. Finally, the flux rope was totally disintegrated, producing several solar jets along the overlying field. These observations demonstrate that the external reconnection between the flux rope and overlying field can destroy the flux rope, thus playing a crucial role in confining the solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>Plasma motions in the solar corona and solar wind to 1 au, as inferred from radio wave scattering observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting solar burst properties as well as sources viewed through the turbulent atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model based on solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The frequency broadening is consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances $\gtrsim 10$ $R_\odot$, but the levels of frequency broadening for $\lesssim 10$ $R_\odot$ require additional radial speeds $\sim (100-300)$ km s$^{-1}$ and/or transverse speeds $\sim (20-70)$ km s$^{-1}$. The inferred radial velocities appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with non-thermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfv\'enic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allow an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of $\sim(1-3)$ $R_\odot$ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves to the small scales where heating takes place.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted an analysis of nebulae around Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in M33 using data collected by the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope as part of the SIGNALS Large Program. Of the 211 known Wolf-Rayet stars in M33, 178 are located in the fields observed in this study. We present the results of this analysis in the form of a comprehensive summary of all nebulae found around the observed WR stars. Based on three criteria we find to be the most effective for their detection, we detect a clear association with a circumstellar bubble around 33 of them (19\%). Our results show that the presence of bubbles does not correlate with the spectral type of the central star. The mean diameter of the WR nebulae we have found is 21 parsecs.</description>

      <title>TYC 3340-2437-1: A Quadruple System with A Massive Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical massive quadruple systems are ideal laboratories for examining the theories of star formation, dynamical evolution, and stellar evolution. The successive mergers of hierarchical quadruple systems might explain the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Looking for light curves of O-type binaries identified by LAMOST, we find a (2+2) quadruple system: TYC 3340-2437-1, located in the stellar bow-shock nebula (SBN). It has a probability of over 99.99\% being a quadruple system derived from the surface density of the vicinity stars. Its inner orbital periods are 3.390602(89) days and 2.4378(16) days, respectively, and the total mass is about (11.47 + 5.79) + (5.2 + 2.02) = 24.48 $M_{\odot}$. The line-of-sight inclinations of the inner binaries, B$_1$ and B$_2$, are 55.94 and 78.2 degrees, respectively, indicating that they are not co-planar. Based on observations spanning 34 months and the significance of the astrometric excess noise ($D&gt;2$) in Gaia DR3 data, we guess that its outer orbital period might be a few years. If it were true, the quadruple system might form through the disk fragmentation mechanism with outer eccentric greater than zero. This eccentricity could be the cause of both the arc-like feature of the SBN and the noncoplanarity of the inner orbit. The outer orbital period and outer eccentric could be determined with the release of future epoch astrometric data of Gaia.</description>

      <title>Episodicity in accretion-ejection processes associated with IRAS 15398-3359</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The protostar IRAS 15398-3359 is associated with a bipolar molecular outflow ejected in an nearly northeast-southwest (NE-SW) direction which has been extensively studied. It has been suggested previous episodic accretion events by this source. Furthermore, the analysis of the morphology and kinematics of the molecular outflow revealed the presence of four $^{12}$CO(2-1) bipolar elliptical shock-like structures identified in both lobes. These structures seem to trace different ejections inclined $\sim$10\deg on the plane of the sky from each other. This led to the hypothesis that the outflow axis likely precesses and launches material episodically. We analyze ALMA archive observations in Band 6, revealing the presence of low-velocity ($&lt;3.5$km s$^{-1}$) emission from the line $^{12}$CO(2-1) to the south and north of the protostar. We study the morphology and kinematics of the gas, which seems to support the hypothesis of a precessing episodic outflow. The ALMA observations reveal a north-south (N-S) outflow most likely associated with the IRAS 15398-3359 protostellar system. This outflow could be older than the well-studied NE-SW outflow. The orientation of the N-S outflow is 50\deg - 60\deg on the plane of the sky away from that of the NE-SW outflow. We also analyze the Spectral Energy Distribution of a far away young star and preliminary discard it as the driver of the SE outflow remnants. The new observations support the hypothesis of strong episodic accretion-ejection events in IRAS 15398-3359, accompanied by dramatic changes in the orientation of its ejection axis, implying that all the outflows in the region may have been driven by the same protostar.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a hot post-AGB star in Galactic globular cluster E3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new hot-PAGB star identified in the Galactic GC E3, which is one of the first to show a binary signature among the identified PAGB stars of GCs. We present a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis to study the evolutionary status of the newly identified hot-PAGB star. We use Gaia EDR3 proper motion (PM) and parallax measurements to confirm the cluster membership. We supplement the photometric observations with radial velocities (RVs) from multi-epoch high resolution (R$\sim$28000) spectroscopic observations. We fitted the spectral energy distribution of 30 photometric fluxes of the PAGB star from ultraviolet to infra-red passbands with the TLUSTY BSTAR2006 stellar atmosphere model to derive its physical parameters, \Teff, $\log g$, \Lbol, and R. We derive the chemical abundances of nine elements (He, C, N, O, Ne, Al, Si, S, and Fe) using spectroscopic measurements. The derived chemical abundances, kinematic information, and stellar parameters are used to study the evolution history of the star. The PM and parallax of the identified PAGB star match well with cluster parameters, which confirms its cluster membership. We find that the RVs vary over $\sim$6 \kms\ between the two epochs. This is an indication of the star being in a binary orbit. A simulation of possible binary systems with the observed RVs suggests a binary period of either 39.12 days or 17.83 days with mass ratio, q$\geq$1.0. The [Fe/H] derived using the high-resolution spectra is $\sim -$0.7 dex matches well with the cluster metallicity. Various PAGB evolutionary tracks on the H-R diagram suggest a current mass of the identified PAGB star in the range 0.51$-$0.55 \Msun. The star is enriched with C and O abundances, showing similar CNO abundances compared to the other PAGB stars of GCs with the evidence of 3rd dredge-up on the AGB phase.</description>

      <title>The physics of Core-Collapse Supernovae: explosion mechanism and explosive nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in multi-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae have considerably improved our understanding of this complex phenomenon. In addition to that, one-dimensional (1D) studies have been employed to study the explosion mechanism and its causal connection to the pre-collapse structure of the star, as well as to explore the vast parameter space of supernovae. Nonetheless, many uncertainties still affect the late stages of the evolution of massive stars, their collapse, and the subsequent shock propagation. In this review, we will briefly summarize the state-of-the-art of both 1D and 3D simulations and how they can be employed to study the evolution of massive stars, supernova explosions, and shock propagation, focusing on the uncertainties that affect each of these phases. Finally, we will illustrate the typical nucleosynthesis products that emerge from the explosion.</description>

      <title>Light Curve Classification with DistClassiPy: a new distance-based classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of synoptic sky surveys has ushered in an era of big data in time-domain astronomy, making data science and machine learning essential tools for studying celestial objects. Tree-based (e.g. Random Forests) and deep learning models represent the current standard in the field. We explore the use of different distance metrics to aid in the classification of objects. For this, we developed a new distance metric based classifier called DistClassiPy. The direct use of distance metrics is an approach that has not been explored in time-domain astronomy, but distance-based methods can aid in increasing the interpretability of the classification result and decrease the computational costs. In particular, we classify light curves of variable stars by comparing the distances between objects of different classes. Using 18 distance metrics applied to a catalog of 6,000 variable stars in 10 classes, we demonstrate classification and dimensionality reduction. We show that this classifier meets state-of-the-art performance but has lower computational requirements and improved interpretability. We have made DistClassiPy open-source and accessible at https://pypi.org/project/distclassipy/ with the goal of broadening its applications to other classification scenarios within and beyond astronomy.</description>

      <title>High-precision astrometry with VVV -- II. A near-infrared extension of Gaia into the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We use near-infrared, ground-based data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to indirectly extend the astrometry provided by the Gaia catalog to objects in heavily-extincted regions towards the Galactic bulge and plane that are beyond Gaia's reach. Methods. We make use of the state-of-the-art techniques developed for high-precision astrometry and photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope to process the VVV data. We employ empirical, spatially-variable, effective point-spread functions and local transformations to mitigate the effects of systematic errors, like residual geometric distortion and image motion, and to improve measurements in crowded fields and for faint stars. We also anchor our astrometry to the absolute reference frame of the Gaia Data Release 3. Results. We measure between 20 and 60 times more sources than Gaia in the region surrounding the Galactic center, obtaining an single-exposure precision of about 12 mas and a proper-motion precision of better than 1 mas yr$^{-1}$ for bright, unsaturated sources. Our astrometry provides an extension of Gaia into the Galactic center. We publicly release the astro-photometric catalogs of the two VVV fields considered in this work, which contain a total of $\sim$ 3.5 million sources. Our catalogs cover $\sim$ 3 sq. degrees, about 0.5% of the entire VVV survey area.</description>

Abstract: Until the advent of the SOLARNET recommendations, metadata sharing of simulated data within the Solar Physics community has been mostly on a "private communication" basis, with the description of the data format and content conveyed in an ad hoc manner. This document aims to amend this situation by establishing recommendations for representing such data and the associated metadata, based on the SOLARNET Metadata Recommendations for Solar Observations (arXiv:2011.12139)</description>

      <title>BD-14 3065b (TOI-4987b): from giant planet to brown dwarf: evidence for deuterium burning in old age?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study reports the confirmation of BD-14 3065b, a transiting planet/brown dwarf in a triple-star system, with a mass near the deuterium burning boundary. BD-14 3065b has the largest radius observed within the sample of giant planets and brown dwarfs around post-main-sequence stars. Its orbital period is 4.3 days, and it transits a subgiant F-type star with a mass of $M_\star=1.41 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=2.35 \pm 0.08 R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6935\pm90$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.34\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the TRES and Pucheros+ spectrographs, we measured a mass of $M_p=12.37\pm0.92 M_J$ and a radius of $R_p=1.926\pm0.094 R_J$. Our discussion of potential processes that could be responsible for the inflated radius led us to conclude that deuterium burning is a plausible explanation resulting from the heating of BD-14 3065b's interior. Detection of the secondary eclipse with TESS photometry enables a precise determination of the eccentricity $e_p=0.066\pm0.011$ and reveals BD-14 3065b has a brightness temperature of $3520 \pm 130$ K. With its unique characteristics, BD-14 3065b presents an excellent opportunity to study its atmosphere through thermal emission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV gamma-ray emission from the possible TeV-bright red dwarfs with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red dwarfs have been suggested to be among the possible astrophysical species accelerating particles and emitting TeV $\gamma$-rays. As an effort to search for the GeV $\gamma$-ray counterparts of the suggested TeV emission from eight red dwarfs, we analyse the 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission of the regions covering them exploiting the $\sim$13.6 yr Pass 8 data of the Fermi Large Area Telescope. A GeV $\gamma$-ray emission excess with significance of 3.8$\sigma$ is detected in the direction of the red dwarf V962 Tau. This emission contains V962 Tau in 1$\sigma$ error radius and is independent of the catalog source. However, the stellar flare scenario can hardly explain the total energy and lightcurve derived from the $\gamma$-ray emission in view of the spectral analysis. We also analyse the lightcurves in the positions of the eight red dwarfs and no time bin with significance $&gt;$5$\sigma$ is found. Therefore, no significant emission from the red dwarfs could be concluded to be detected by Fermi-LAT.</description>

      <title>A Short Intense Dynamo at the Onset of Crystallization in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of large magnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^6~\mathrm{G}$) in isolated white dwarfs is not clear. One possible explanation is that crystallization of the star's core drives compositional convection, which when combined with the star's rotation, can drive a dynamo. However, whether convection is efficient enough to explain the large intensity of the observed magnetic fields is still under debate. Recent work has shown that convection in cooling white dwarfs spans two regimes: efficient convection at the onset of crystallization, and thermohaline convection during most of the star's cooling history. Here, we calculate the properties of crystallization-driven convection for cooling models of several white dwarfs of different masses. We combine mixing-length theory with scalings from magneto-rotational convection to estimate the typical magnitude of the convective velocity and induced magnetic field for both scenarios. In the thermohaline regime, we find velocities $\sim 10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields restricted to $\lesssim~100~\mathrm{G}$. However, when convection is efficient, the flow velocity can reach magnitudes of $\sim 10^2$--$10^3~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields of $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{G}$, independent of the star's rotation rate. Thus, dynamos driven at the onset of crystallization could explain the large intensity magnetic fields measured for single white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>ALMA Spectral Survey of An eruptive Young star, V883 Ori (ASSAY): I. What triggered the current episode of eruption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An unbiased spectral survey of V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, was carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 6. The detected line emission from various molecules reveals morphological/kinematical features in both the Keplerian disk and the infalling envelope. A direct infall signature, red-shifted absorption against continuum, has been detected in CO, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, and H$_2$CO. HCO$^+$ and SO show large arm-like structures that probably connect from an infalling envelope to the disk. HCN and H$_2$CO reveal a distinct boundary between the inner and outer disk and reveal tentative spiral structures connecting the outer disk to the inner disk. HNC shows a large central emission hole (r $\sim$0.3\arcsec) due to its chemical conversion to HCN at high temperatures. The HDO emission, a direct tracer of the water sublimation region, has been detected in the disk. Molecular emission from complex organic molecules (COMs) is confined within the HDO emission boundary, and HCO$^+$ has an emission hole in its distribution due to its destruction by water. Together, these features suggest that the current episode of eruption in V883 Ori may be triggered by the infall from the envelope to the outer disk, generating a spiral wave, which propagates inward and greatly enhances the accretion onto the central star.</description>

      <title>Tidal synchronization trapping in stars and planets with convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a "pseudosynchronous" ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for "inertial" waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes, and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable "synchronization traps" at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict, but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.</description>

      <title>Eccentric black hole mergers via three-body interactions in young, globular, and nuclear star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eccentric mergers are a signature of the dynamical formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs) in dense stellar environments and hierarchical triple systems. Here, we investigate the formation of eccentric mergers via binary-single interactions by means of $2.5\times10^{5}$ direct $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Our simulations include post-Newtonian terms up to the 2.5th order and model the typical environment of young (YSCs), globular (GCs), and nuclear star clusters (NSCs). Around $0.6\%$ ($1\%$) of our mergers in NSCs (GCs) have an eccentricity ${&gt;0.1}$ when the emitted gravitational wave frequency is 10 Hz in the source frame, while in YSCs this fraction rises to $1.6\%$. Approximately $\sim63\%$ of these mergers are produced by chaotic, resonant interactions where temporary binaries are continuously formed and destroyed, while $\sim31\%$ arise from an almost direct collision of two black holes (BHs). Lastly, $\sim 6\%$ of these eccentric mergers occur in temporary hierarchical triples. We find that binaries undergoing a flyby generally develop smaller tilt angles with respect to exchanges. This result challenges the idea that perfectly isotropic spin orientations are produced by dynamics. The environment dramatically affects BH retention: $0\%$, $3.1\%$, and $19.9\%$ of all the remnant BHs remain in YSCs, GCs, and NSCs, respectively. The fraction of massive BHs also depends on the host cluster properties, with pair-instability ($60\leq\,$M$_{\rm BH}$/M$_{\odot}\leq$100) and intermediate-mass (M$_{\rm BH}\geq$100$\,$M$_{\odot}$) BHs accounting for approximately $\sim44\%$ and $1.6\%$ of the mergers in YSCs, $\sim33\%$ and $0.7\%$ in GCs, and $\sim28\%$ and $0.4\%$ in NSCs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Bright Supernova Precursors by Outbursts from Massive Stars with Compact Object Companions</title>

Abstract: A fraction of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar matter are preceded by bright precursor emission. While the precursors are likely caused by a mass ejection before core-collapse, their mechanism to power energetic bursts, sometimes reaching $10^{48}$--$10^{49}\ {\rm erg}$ that are larger than the binding energies of red supergiant envelopes, is still under debate. Remarkably, such a huge energy-deposition should result in an almost complete envelope ejection and hence a strong sign of interaction, but the observed SNe with precursors show in fact typical properties among the interacting SNe. More generally, the observed luminosity of $10^{40-42}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ is shown to be challenging for a single SN progenitor. To resolve these tensions, we propose a scenario where the progenitor is in a binary system with a compact object (CO), and an outburst from the star leads to a super-Eddington accretion onto the CO. We show that for sufficiently short separations, outbursts with moderate initial kinetic energies of $10^{46}$--$10^{47}$ erg can be energized by the accreting CO so that their radiative output can be consistent with the observed precursors. We discuss the implications of our model in relation to CO binaries detectable with Gaia and gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>From Cavitation to Astrophysics: Explicit Solution of the Spherical Collapse Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations of the form $\ddot R=-kR^\gamma$, with a positive constant $k$ and real parameter $\gamma$, are fundamental in describing phenomena such as the spherical gravitational collapse ($\gamma=-2$), the implosion of cavitation bubbles ($\gamma=-4$) and the orbital decay in binary black holes ($\gamma=-7$). While explicit elemental solutions exist for select integer values of $\gamma$, more comprehensive solutions encompassing larger subsets of $\gamma$ have been independently developed in hydrostatics (see Lane-Emden equation) and hydrodynamics (see Rayleigh-Plesset equation). I here present a universal explicit solution for all real $\gamma$, invoking the beta distribution. Although standard numerical ODE solvers can readily evaluate more general second order differential equations, this explicit solution reveals a hidden connection between collapse motions and probability theory that enables further analytical manipulations, it conceptually unifies distinct fields, and it offers insights into symmetry properties, thereby enhancing our understanding of these pervasive differential equations.</description>

      <title>Improving the open cluster census. III. Using cluster masses, radii, and dynamics to create a cleaned open cluster catalogue</title>

Abstract: The census of open clusters has exploded in size thanks to data from the Gaia satellite. However, it is likely that many of these reported clusters are not gravitationally bound, making the open cluster census impractical for many scientific applications. We test different physically motivated methods for distinguishing between bound and unbound clusters, using them to create a cleaned cluster catalogue. We derived completeness-corrected photometric masses for 6956 clusters from our earlier work. Then, we used these masses to compute the size of the Roche surface of these clusters (their Jacobi radius) and distinguish between bound and unbound clusters. We find that only 5647 (79%) of the clusters from our previous catalogue are compatible with bound open clusters, dropping to just 11% of clusters within 250 pc. 3530 open clusters are in a strongly cut high quality sample. The moving groups in our sample show different trends in their size as a function of age and mass, suggesting that they are unbound and undergoing different dynamical processes. Our cluster mass measurements constitute the largest catalogue of Milky Way cluster masses to date, which we also use for further science. Firstly, we inferred the mass-dependent completeness limit of the open cluster census, showing that the census is complete within 1.8 kpc only for objects heavier than 230 M$_\odot$. Next, we derived a completeness-corrected age and mass function for our open cluster catalogue, including estimating that the Milky Way contains a total of $1.3 \times 10^5$ open clusters, only ~4% of which are currently known. Finally, we show that most open clusters have mass functions compatible with the Kroupa initial mass function. We demonstrate Jacobi radii for distinguishing between bound and unbound star clusters, and publish an updated star cluster catalogue with masses and improved cluster classifications.
