      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Entanglement Between Photon and Phonon Modes in a Coulomb-coupled Optomechanical Cavity Magnonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum information science and a crucial resource for quantum technologies such as precision sensing, secure communication, and computation. In hybrid cavity magno-optomechanical systems, entanglement among cavity photons, magnons, and phonons enables manipulation of quantum states across different modes via radiation pressure-based light-matter interaction. We propose a hybrid optomechanical cavity-magnonic setup with Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere allowing magnons to couple with photons via magnetic-dipole interaction. The system also uses optomechanical and electrostatic interactions to entangle cavity photons and mechanical resonators. We focus on how the magnon nonlinear Kerr effect and varying coupling strengths influence entanglement dynamics. By analysing nonlinear effects alongside other coupling parameters, we identify optimal conditions for initiating and sustaining robust entanglement between the motional modes (phonons) of two Coulomb-coupled mechanical resonators. Our model predicts that adding Coulomb interaction and magnon coupling enhances the degree and tunability of entanglement, making it more resilient to thermal baths at 3 K. This study addresses how to optimize and sustain phonon-phonon entanglement in complex hybrid quantum systems. These findings offer insights relevant to developing quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information processing and other quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic metamaterial time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven optical materials and metamaterials have recently emerged as a promising platform for realizing photonic time crystals (PTCs) -systems whose optical properties are strongly and periodically modulated on time scales comparable to the optical cycle of light. These time-varying structures are the temporal counterparts of spatial photonic crystals (SPCs), for which a large and periodic dielectric contrast is achieved spatially on wavelength scales. Just as SPCs have revolutionized control over light-matter interactions by engineering the photonic density of states in space, PTCs promise comparable breakthroughs from a fundamentally new perspective: a temporal one. However, harnessing such phenomena at optical frequencies poses severe experimental challenges, as it requires order-unity modulation depths of the optical properties at optical cycle rates, a regime that has remained elusive to date. Here, we report the first optical realization of a photonic time crystal, achieved with a surface plasmon cavity metamaterial operating at Terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate strong (near-unity) and coherent (sub-optical cycle) periodic driving of the plasmonic metamaterial enabled by field-induced dynamical modulation of the carriers' kinetic energy and effective mass - reaching up to 80% of their rest mass, an exceptionally high value that forms the basis for time-crystalline phenomena with plasmons. Our experimentally informed theory reveals rich physics within the experimentally accessible parameter regime of this system, including parametric amplification and entangled plasmon generation, and establishes a robust new platform for time-domain photonics.</description>

      <title>New Junction Condition and Casimir effect for Network CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, BCFT and ICFT have been generalized to the CFT on networks (NCFT). A key aspect of NCFT is how we connect the CFTs in different edges at the nodes of the network. For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar fields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction condition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be continuous at the node. We demonstrate that this new junction condition is consistent with the variational principle and energy conservation. Furthermore, we provide an exact realization of it in a real physical system. As an application, we analyze the Casimir effect using both the traditional and the new junction conditions in networks formed by regular polyhedra. Our results indicate that the new junction condition generally results in a smaller Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy low-noise electrical measurements in a closed-cycle pulse-tube cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A shift of paradigm to obtain (sub-)Kelvin environment is currently on-going with the democratization of cryogen-free cryocoolers, boosted by their easy-to-use and continuous operation without the need of liquid helium whose cost and scarcity globally increase. Thanks to their large sample space and cooling power, they can host a superconducting magnet and are an adapted platform for quantum technologies, material science, low temperature detectors and even medical fields. The drawback is that this type of system is inherently based on gas compression that induces a certain level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, which can potentially prevent the determination of low amplitude signals or spoil their stability. In this paper we demonstrate that pulse-tube based cryocoolers can be used for electrical precision measurements, using a commercial cryomagnetic system combined with our home-made a coaxial cryoprobe. In particular, parts-per-billion level of measurement uncertainties in resistance determination, based on quantum Hall resistance standards, is achievable at the level of state-of-the-art measurements involving conventional cryostats based on liquid helium. We performed an extensive characterization of the cryomagnetic system to determine the level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, and revealed that although the magnetic field has a drastic effect on the noise level, only marginal interplays on the measurement are observed as long as the working frequencies of the instrumentation are not in the vicinity of the ones of the perturbations. The set of characterization measurements presented here are easily implementable in laboratories, which can help to determine the vibrations and electromagnetic pollution generated by any cryocooler.</description>

      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography imposes a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for three-dimensional conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound on the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, the Ising model, and $O(N)$ models with $N=2,3$ at critical points and prove it for the two-dimensional case. Remarkably, a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries also obeys the holographic bound.</description>

      <title>Casimir Effect for Quantum Field theory in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies quantum field theories defined in networks, which are the multi-branch generalizations of interface conformal field theory (ICFT). We propose a novel junction condition on the node and show that it is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.</description>
