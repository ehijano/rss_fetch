      <title>Weighted inequalities for the Bergman projection involving B\'{e}koll\`{e}--Bonami $B_1$-weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider weighted inequalities for the Bergman projection via sparse domination. We first establish some quantitative mixed weak-type inequalities, which leads to a weighted weak-type (1,1) bound in terms of B\'{e}koll\`{e}--Bonami $B_1$-weights. We also establish some quantitative weighted $L^p$-estimates in terms of B\'{e}koll\`{e}--Bonami $B_q$-weights for $1\leq q&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>On the convexity of Berezin range and Berezin radius inequalities via a class of semi-norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of semi-norms, say $\sigma_\mu$-Berezin norm on the space of all bounded linear operators $B(\mathcal{H})$ defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, namely, for each $\mu \in [0,1]$ and $p\geq 1$, $$\|T\|_{\sigma_{\mu}\text{-ber}}= \sup_{\lambda\in\Omega}\left\lbrace \left(|\langle T\hat{k}_\lambda,\hat{k}_\lambda\rangle |^p~ \sigma_{\mu}~ \|T\hat{k}_\lambda\|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\right\rbrace $$ where $T\in B(\mathcal{H})$ and $\sigma_{\mu}$ is an interpolation path of the symmetric mean $\sigma$. We investigate many fundamental properties of the $\sigma_\mu$-Berezin norm and develop several inequalities associated with it. Utilizing these inequalities, we derive improved bounds for the Berezin radius of bounded linear operators, enhancing previously known estimates. Furthermore, we study the convexity of the Berezin range of a class of composition operators and weighted shift operators on both the Hardy space and the Bergman space.</description>

      <title>Conjugate phase retrieval on graphs and with applications in shift-invariant spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the conjugate phase retrieval for complex-valued \mbox{signals} residing on graphs, and explore its applications to shift-invariant spaces. Given a complex-valued graph signal $\bf f$ residing on the graph $\mathcal G$, we introduce a graph ${\mathcal G}_{\bf f}$ and show that its connectivity is sufficient to determine $\bf f$ up to a global unimodular constant and conjugation. We then construct two explicit graph models and show that graph signals residing on them can be recovered, up to a unimodular constant and conjugation, from its absolute values on the vertices and the relative magnitudes between neighboring vertices. Building on this graph-based framework, we apply our results to shift-invariant spaces generated by real-valued functions. For signals in the Paley-Wiener space, we show that any complex-valued function can be recovered, up to a unimodular constant and conjugation, from structured phaseless samples taken at three times the Nyquist rate. For more general shift invariant spaces, we establish the conjugate phase retrievability of signals from phaseless samples collected on a discrete sampling set, in conjunction with relative magnitude measurements between neighboring sample points. Two numerical reconstruction algorithms are introduced to recover the signals in the Paley-Wiener space and general shift-invariant spaces, up to a unimodular constant and conjugation, from the given phaseless measurements.</description>

      <title>The study of symmetries: some general techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S(H)$ be the set of all self-adjoint bonded linear operators on $H$ and $\mathcal{V} \subset S(H)$ a subset that is pertinent in mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. A symmetry is a bijective map $\phi :\mathcal{V} \to \mathcal{V}$ which is an automorphism with respect to one or more relations and/or operations on $\mathcal{V}$ that are relevant in mathematical physics. We will explain several ideas that can be used when studying the general form of symmetries.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$. Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band, which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$, classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$ follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for completeness.</description>

      <title>Free semigroupoid algebras and the first cohomology groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates derivations of the free semigroupoid algebra $\mathfrak{L}_G$ of a countable or uncountable directed graph $G$ and its norm-closed version, the tensor algebra $\mathcal{A}_G$. We first prove a weak Dixmier approximation theorem for $\mathfrak{L}_G$ when $G$ is strongly connected. Using the theorem, we show that if every connected component of $G$ is strongly connected, then every bounded derivation $\delta$ from $\mathcal{A}_G$ into $\mathfrak{L}_G$ is of the form $\delta=\delta_T$ for some $T\in\mathfrak{L}_G$ with $\|T\|\leqslant\|\delta\|$. For any finite directed graph $G$, we also show that the first cohomology group $H^1(\mathcal{A}_G,\mathfrak{L}_G)$ vanishes if and only if every connected component of $G$ is either strongly connected or a fruit tree.
  To handle infinite directed graphs, we introduce the alternating number and propose \Cref{conj intro-in-tree}. Suppose every connected component of $G$ is not strongly connected. We show that if every bounded derivation from $\mathcal{A}_G$ into $\mathfrak{L}_G$ is inner, then every connected component of $G$ is a generalized fruit tree and the alternating number $A(G)$ of $G$ is finite. The converse is also true if the conjecture holds.
  Finally, we provide some examples of free semigroupoid algebras together with their nontrivial first cohomology groups.</description>

      <title>Sections and cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By Bartle-Graves theorem every surjective map between C*-algebras has a continuous section, and Loring proved that that there exists a continuous section of norm arbitrary close to 1. Here we prove that there exists a continuous section of norm exactly 1. This result is used in the second part of the paper which is devoted to properties of cone C*-algebras.
  It is proved that any $\ast$-homomorphism from the cone over a separable C*-algebra to a quotient C*-algebra always lifts to a contractive asymptotic homomorphism.
  As an application we give a short proof and strengthen the result of Forough-Gardella-Thomsen that states that any cpc (order zero) map has an asymptotically cpc (order zero, respectively) lift.
  As another application we give unified proofs of Voiculescu's result that cones are quasidiagonal and Brown-Carrion-White's result that all amenable traces on cones are quasidiagonal. We also prove that all hyperlinear traces on cones are MF.</description>

      <title>Real Noncommutative Convexity II: Extremality and nc convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue with the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, following the recent and profound complex case developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the theory of nc extreme (and pure and maximal) points and the nc Choquet boundary in the real case, and on the theory of real nc convex and semicontinuous functions and real nc convex envelopes. Our main emphasis is on how these interact with complexification. For example some of our paper analyzes carefully how various notions of `extreme' or `maximal' interact with our earlier concept of the complexification of a convex set. Several new features appear in the real case in later sections of our paper, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex function, and the complexification of the convex envelope of a nc function. With an Appendix by T. Russell.</description>

      <title>Numerical Fredholm determinants for matrix-valued kernels on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a numerical method for computing Fredholm determinants of trace class and Hilbert Schmidt integral operators defined in terms of matrix-valued kernels on the entire real line. With this method, the Fredholm determinant is approximated by the determinant of a matrix constructed by truncating the kernel of the operator to a finite interval and then applying a quadrature rule. Under the assumption that the kernel decays exponentially, we derive an estimate relating the Fredholm determinant of the operator on the real line to that of its truncation to a finite interval. Then we derive a quadrature error estimate relating the Fredholm determinant of a matrix-valued kernel on a finite interval to its numerical approximation obtained via an adaptive composite Simpson's quadrature rule. These results extend the analysis of Bornemann which focused on Fredholm determinants of trace class operators defined by scalar-valued kernels on a finite interval. Numerical results are provided for a Birman-Schwinger operator that characterizes the stability of stationary solutions of nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Isometric pairs with compact and normal cross-commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We represent and classify pairs of commuting isometries $(V_1, V_2)$ acting on Hilbert spaces that satisfy the condition \[ [V_1^*, V_2] = \text{compact and normal}, \] where $[V_1^*, V_2] := V_1^* V_2 - V_2 V_1^*$ is the cross-commutator of $(V_1, V_2)$. The precise description of such pairs also gives a complete and concrete set of unitary invariants. The basic building blocks of representations of such pairs consist of four distinguished pairs of commuting isometries. One of them relies on some peculiar examples of invariant subspaces tracing back to Rudin's intricate constructions of analytic functions on the bidisc. Along the way, we present a rank formula for a general pair of commuting isometries that looks to be the first of its kind.</description>

      <title>Groupoid Characterization of Partial Algebras on Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $L^p$-spaces, with $p \not = \infty$, form a partial algebra $(L^p(\Omega), \Gamma, \cdot)$ with pointwise multiplication of functions. The Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$, delineated by weak derivatives as subspaces of $L^p$-spaces is shown to contain the partial algebra $(L^p(\Omega), \Gamma, \cdot)$ generalized by the partial action of the smooth algebra $\mathscr{K}(\Omega)$ by convolution on the Banach spaces $L^p(\Omega)$. We characterised the Sobolev space $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$, invariant under $\mathscr{K}(\Omega)$ partial action, using Lie groupoid framework, and study the partial algebra as defining the partial dynamical systems on the $L^p$-space associated with the weak differential operators. The locally convex partial $^*$-algebra $(L^p(\Omega), \Gamma, \cdot,^*)$ defines the stable local flows coinciding with local bisections of the Lie groupoid. The unitary representation of resulting Lie groupoid $\mathscr{W} \rightrightarrows W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ on the associated Hilbert bundle demonstrates the simplification achieved by the characterisation.</description>

Abstract: Chebotarev's theorem on roots of unity states that all minors of a Fourier matrix are non-zero if and only if the order of the matrix is prime. We establish cases in which all principal minors of Fourier matrices of square-free order are non-zero. In a subsequent paper we discuss the case of composites containing squares.</description>
