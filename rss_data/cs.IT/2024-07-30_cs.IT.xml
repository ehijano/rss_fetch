      <title>5G NR Positioning with OpenAirInterface: Tools and Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) technology is expected to provide precise and reliable positioning capabilities along with high data rates. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started introducing positioning techniques from Release-16 based on time, angle, and signal strength using reference signals. However, validating these techniques with experimental prototypes is crucial before successful real-world deployment. This work provides useful tools and implementation details that are required in performing 5G positioning experiments with OpenAirInterface (OAI). As an example use case, we present an round trip time (RTT) estimation test-bed based on OAI and discusses the real-word experiment and measurement process.</description>

      <title>Wireless Multi-User Interactive Virtual Reality in Metaverse with Edge-Device Collaborative Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immersive nature of the metaverse presents significant challenges for wireless multi-user interactive virtual reality (VR), such as ultra-low latency, high throughput and intensive computing, which place substantial demands on the wireless bandwidth and rendering resources of mobile edge computing (MEC). In this paper, we propose a wireless multi-user interactive VR with edge-device collaborative computing framework to overcome the motion-to-photon (MTP) threshold bottleneck. Specifically, we model the serial-parallel task execution in queues within a foreground and background separation architecture. The rendering indices of background tiles within the prediction window are determined, and both the foreground and selected background tiles are loaded into respective processing queues based on the rendering locations. To minimize the age of sensor information and the power consumption of mobile devices, we optimize rendering decisions and MEC resource allocation subject to the MTP constraint. To address this optimization problem, we design a safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, active queue management-constrained updated projection (AQM-CUP). AQM-CUP constructs an environment suitable for queues, incorporating expired tiles actively discarded in processing buffers into its state and reward system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances user immersion while reducing device power consumption, and the superiority of the proposed AQM-CUP algorithm over conventional methods in terms of the training convergence and performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Secure Source Coding Resilient Against Compromised Users via an Access Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a source and multiple users who observe the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of correlated Gaussian random variables. The source wishes to compress its observations and store the result in a public database such that (i) authorized sets of users are able to reconstruct the source with a certain distortion level, and (ii) information leakage to non-authorized sets of colluding users is minimized. In other words, the recovery of the source is restricted to a predefined access structure. The main result of this paper is a closed-form characterization of the fundamental trade-off between the source coding rate and the information leakage rate. As an example, threshold access structures are studied, i.e., the case where any set of at least $t$ users is able to reconstruct the source with some predefined distortion level and the information leakage at any set of users with a size smaller than $t$ is minimized.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Convex-Hull Relaxation Based Algorithm for Multi-User Discrete Passive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology to enhance spatial multiplexing in wireless networks. This letter considers the discrete passive beamforming design for IRS in order to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among multiple users in an IRS-assisted downlink network. The main design difficulty lies in the discrete phase-shift constraint. Differing from most existing works, this letter advocates a convex-hull relaxation of the discrete constraints which leads to a continuous reformulated problem equivalent to the original discrete problem. This letter further proposes an efficient alternating projection/proximal gradient descent and ascent algorithm for solving the reformulated problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.</description>

      <title>The Entrapment Problem in Random Walk Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores decentralized learning in a graph-based setting, where data is distributed across nodes. We investigate a decentralized SGD algorithm that utilizes a random walk to update a global model based on local data. Our focus is on designing the transition probability matrix to speed up convergence. While importance sampling can enhance centralized learning, its decentralized counterpart, using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, can lead to the entrapment problem, where the random walk becomes stuck at certain nodes, slowing convergence. To address this, we propose the Metropolis-Hastings with L\'evy Jumps (MHLJ) algorithm, which incorporates random perturbations (jumps) to overcome entrapment. We theoretically establish the convergence rate and error gap of MHLJ and validate our findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Bayesian Social Learning with Multiview Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Bayesian social learning enables multiple agents to conduct networked signal and information processing through observing environmental signals and information aggregating. Traditional non-Bayesian social learning models only consider single signals, limiting their applications in scenarios where multiple viewpoints of information are available. In this work, we exploit, in the information aggregation step, the independently learned results from observations taken from multiple viewpoints and propose a novel non-Bayesian social learning model for scenarios with multiview observations. We prove the convergence of the model under traditional assumptions and provide convergence conditions for the algorithm in the presence of misleading signals. Through theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, we validate the strong reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Framework for Channel Simulation-Based Base Station Placement and Transmission Power Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an adaptive experimental design framework for channel simulation-based base station (BS) design that supports joint optimization of transmission power and placement. We consider a system in which multiple transmitters provide wireless services over a shared frequency band. Our objective is to maximize the average throughput within an area of interest. System operators can design the system parameters prior to deployment by iterating through channel simulations and updating parameters. However, accurate channel simulations are computationally expensive, thus it is preferable to configure the system using a limited number of simulation iterations. We develop a solver for this problem based on Bayesian optimization (BO), a black-box optimization method. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve 18-22% higher throughput performance compared to conventional placement and power optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Reverse Information Projections and Optimal E-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information projections have found important applications in probability theory, statistics, and related areas. In the field of hypothesis testing in particular, the reverse information projection (RIPr) has recently been shown to lead to growth-rate optimal (GRO) e-statistics for testing simple alternatives against composite null hypotheses. However, the RIPr as well as the GRO criterion are undefined whenever the infimum information divergence between the null and alternative is infinite. We show that in such scenarios, under some assumptions, there still exists a measure in the null that is closest to the alternative in a specific sense. Whenever the information divergence is finite, this measure coincides with the usual RIPr. It therefore gives a natural extension of the RIPr to certain cases where the latter was previously not defined. This extended notion of the RIPr is shown to lead to optimal e-statistics in a sense that is a novel, but natural, extension of the GRO criterion. We also give conditions under which the (extension of the) RIPr is a strict sub-probability measure, as well as conditions under which an approximation of the RIPr leads to approximate e-statistics. For this case we provide tight relations between the corresponding approximation rates.</description>

      <title>IRS-Aided Multi-Antenna Wireless Powered Communications in Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multi-antenna wireless powered communications in a multi-link interference channel, where multiple IRSs are deployed to enhance the downlink/uplink communications between each pair of hybrid access point (HAP) and wireless device. Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing the allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and meanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission schemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For the resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework capable of suboptimally addressing all of them. Numerical results show that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their counterparts without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission energy consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme consistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is more appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and limited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low cross-link interference scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advocating for the Silent: Enhancing Federated Generalization for Non-Participating Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07171v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has surged in prominence due to its capability of collaborative model training without direct data sharing. However, the vast disparity in local data distributions among clients, often termed the Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) challenge, poses a significant hurdle to FL's generalization efficacy. The scenario becomes even more complex when not all clients participate in the training process, a common occurrence due to unstable network connections or limited computational capacities. This can greatly complicate the assessment of the trained models' generalization abilities. While a plethora of recent studies has centered on the generalization gap pertaining to unseen data from participating clients with diverse distributions, the distinction between the training distributions of participating clients and the testing distributions of non-participating ones has been largely overlooked. In response, our paper unveils an information-theoretic generalization framework for FL. Specifically, it quantifies generalization errors by evaluating the information entropy of local distributions and discerning discrepancies across these distributions. Inspired by our deduced generalization bounds, we introduce a weighted aggregation approach and a duo of client selection strategies. These innovations are designed to strengthen FL's ability to generalize and thus ensure that trained models perform better on non-participating clients by incorporating a more diverse range of client data distributions. Our extensive empirical evaluations reaffirm the potency of our proposed methods, aligning seamlessly with our theoretical construct.</description>

      <title>Ground-to-UAV sub-Terahertz channel measurement and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted terahertz (THz) wireless communications have been expected to play a vital role in the next generation of wireless networks. UAVs can serve as either repeaters or data collectors within the communication link, thereby potentially augmenting the efficacy of communication systems. Despite their promise, the channel analysis and modeling specific to THz wireless channels leveraging UAVs remain under explored. This work delves into a ground-to-UAV channel at 140 GHz, with a specific focus on the influence of UAV hovering behavior on channel performance. Employing experimental measurements through an unmodulated channel setup and a geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) that integrates three-dimensional positional coordinates and beamwidth, this work evaluates the impact of UAV dynamic movements and antenna orientation on channel performance. Our findings highlight the minimal impact of UAV orientation adjustments on channel performance and underscore the diminishing necessity for precise alignment between UAVs and ground stations as beamwidth increases.</description>
