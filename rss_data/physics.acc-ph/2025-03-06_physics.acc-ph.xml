      <title>Triple Evaporation of Bialkali Antimonide Photocathodes and Photoemission Characterization at the PhoTEx Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-performance photocathodes is essential for generating high-brightness electron beams required by existing and future accelerators. This work introduces a state-of-the-art triple evaporation growth system designed for bialkali antimonide photocathodes. By enabling the simultaneous deposition of all three materials, this system significantly enhances vacuum stability and the reproducibility of photocathode fabrication. Complementing this, the novel characterization system PhoTEx allows spatially and spectrally resolved measurements of key photocathode parameters, such as quantum efficiency (QE), mean transverse energy (MTE), reflectance and lifetime. Crucially, all measurements are performed within a single compact setup, without moving the sample, preserving ultra-high vacuum conditions. The spectral resolved measurement of the reflectance allows the investigation of the color. Photocathode colorimetry may provide valuable insights into material homogeneity and aging. A Na-K-Sb photocathode was grown using the triple evaporation method, achieving an initial QE of $5.5\,\%$ at $520\,$nm. The photocathode was characterized at PhoTEx over two months, demonstrating consistent MTE measurements and a dataset with spectral response, reflectance and colorimetry data. Together, the triple evaporation growth system and PhoTEx mark a significant advancement in optimizing photocathodes with exceptional performance, paving the way for brighter and more stable electron sources for next-generation accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>femto-PIXAR: a neural network method for reconstruction of femtosecond X-ray free electron laser pulse energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray Free Electron Lasers (X\nobreakdash-FELs) operate in a wide range of lasing configurations for a broad variety of scientific applications at ultrafast time-scales such as structural biology, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Shot-by-shot characterization of the X-FEL pulses is crucial for analysis of many experiments as well as tuning the X-FEL performance. However, for the weak pulses found in advanced configurations, e.g. those needed for coherent, two-pulse studies of quantum materials, there is no current method for reliably resolving pulse profiles. Here we show that a physics-based U-net model can reconstruct the individual pulse power profiles for sub-picosecond pulse separation without the need for simulations. Using experimental data from weak X-FEL pulse pairs, we demonstrate we can learn the pulse characteristics on a shot-by-shot basis when conventional methods fail.</description>
