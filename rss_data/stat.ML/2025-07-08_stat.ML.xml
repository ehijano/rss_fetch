      <title>Beyond SEO: A Transformer-Based Approach for Reinventing Web Content Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of generative AI search engines is disrupting traditional SEO, with Gartner predicting 25% reduction in conventional search usage by 2026. This necessitates new approaches for web content visibility in AI-driven search environments. We present a domain-specific fine-tuning approach for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) that transforms web content to improve discoverability in large language model outputs. Our method fine-tunes a BART-base transformer on synthetically generated training data comprising 1,905 cleaned travel website content pairs. Each pair consists of raw website text and its GEO-optimized counterpart incorporating credible citations, statistical evidence, and improved linguistic fluency. We evaluate using intrinsic metrics (ROUGE-L, BLEU) and extrinsic visibility assessments through controlled experiments with Llama-3.3-70B. The fine-tuned model achieves significant improvements over baseline BART: ROUGE-L scores of 0.249 (vs. 0.226) and BLEU scores of 0.200 (vs. 0.173). Most importantly, optimized content demonstrates substantial visibility gains in generative search responses with 15.63% improvement in absolute word count and 30.96% improvement in position-adjusted word count metrics. This work provides the first empirical demonstration that targeted transformer fine-tuning can effectively enhance web content visibility in generative search engines with modest computational resources. Our results suggest GEO represents a tractable approach for content optimization in the AI-driven search landscape, offering concrete evidence that small-scale, domain-focused fine-tuning yields meaningful improvements in content discoverability.</description>

      <title>LILI clustering algorithm: Limit Inferior Leaf Interval Integrated into Causal Forest for Causal Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal forest methods are powerful tools in causal inference. Similar to traditional random forest in machine learning, causal forest independently considers each causal tree. However, this independence consideration increases the likelihood that classification errors in one tree are repeated in others, potentially leading to significant bias in causal e ect estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that establishes connections between causal trees through the Limit Inferior Leaf Interval (LILI) clustering algorithm. LILIs are constructed based on the leaves of all causal trees, emphasizing the similarity of dataset confounders. When two instances with di erent treatments are grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they are treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering mechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree methods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect (ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal inference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by relating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set theory. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the convergence of the estimated ATE using LILI clustering. Empirically, extensive comparative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LILI clustering.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized trials leveraging external data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized trials are typically designed to detect average treatment effects but often lack the statistical power to uncover effect heterogeneity over patient characteristics, limiting their value for personalized decision-making. To address this, we propose the QR-learner, a model-agnostic learner that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATE) within the trial population by leveraging external data from other trials or observational studies. The proposed method is robust: it has the potential to reduce the CATE prediction mean squared error while maintaining consistency, even when the external data is not aligned with the trial. Moreover, we introduce a procedure that combines the QR-learner with a trial-only CATE learner and show that it asymptotically matches or exceeds the trial-only learner in terms of mean squared error. We examine the performance of our approach in simulation studies and apply the methods to a real-world dataset, demonstrating improvements in both CATE estimation and statistical power for detecting heterogeneous effects.</description>

      <title>Determination of Particle-Size Distributions from Light-Scattering Measurement Using Constrained Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel methodology for robustly estimating particle size distributions from optical scattering measurements using constrained Gaussian process regression. The estimation of particle size distributions is commonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an ill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise and limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to regularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the Gaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using a pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral expansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary strategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on maximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative approach where the physical constraints are taken into account. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed constrained Gaussian process regression framework accurately reconstructs particle size distributions, producing numerically stable, smooth, and physically interpretable results. This methodology provides a principled and efficient solution for addressing inverse scattering problems and related ill-posed integral equations.</description>

      <title>Implicit Regularisation in Diffusion Models: An Algorithm-Dependent Generalisation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of denoising diffusion models raises important questions regarding their generalisation behaviour, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Notably, it has been shown that when training and sampling are performed perfectly, these models memorise training data -- implying that some form of regularisation is essential for generalisation. Existing theoretical analyses primarily rely on algorithm-independent techniques such as uniform convergence, heavily utilising model structure to obtain generalisation bounds. In this work, we instead leverage the algorithmic aspects that promote generalisation in diffusion models, developing a general theory of algorithm-dependent generalisation for this setting. Borrowing from the framework of algorithmic stability, we introduce the notion of score stability, which quantifies the sensitivity of score-matching algorithms to dataset perturbations. We derive generalisation bounds in terms of score stability, and apply our framework to several fundamental learning settings, identifying sources of regularisation. In particular, we consider denoising score matching with early stopping (denoising regularisation), sampler-wide coarse discretisation (sampler regularisation) and optimising with SGD (optimisation regularisation). By grounding our analysis in algorithmic properties rather than model structure, we identify multiple sources of implicit regularisation unique to diffusion models that have so far been overlooked in the literature.</description>

      <title>Sequential Regression Learning with Randomized Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents ``randomized SINDy", a sequential machine learning algorithm designed for dynamic data that has a time-dependent structure. It employs a probabilistic approach, with its PAC learning property rigorously proven through the mathematical theory of functional analysis. The algorithm dynamically predicts using a learned probability distribution of predictors, updating weights via gradient descent and a proximal algorithm to maintain a valid probability density. Inspired by SINDy (Brunton et al. 2016), it incorporates feature augmentation and Tikhonov regularization. For multivariate normal weights, the proximal step is omitted to focus on parameter estimation. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental results in regression and binary classification using real-world data.</description>

      <title>Leo Breiman, the Rashomon Effect, and the Occam Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the famous Two Cultures paper, Leo Breiman provided a visionary perspective on the cultures of ''data models'' (modeling with consideration of data generation) versus ''algorithmic models'' (vanilla machine learning models). I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's key arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the existence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect implies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated the data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is simplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an accuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has become clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models do not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help explain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to consider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the Rashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam Dilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern computers, with which my observations are much easier to make.
  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality: simpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with the outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the use of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is useful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.
  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two Cultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity, accuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways, without the limitations Breiman was concerned about.</description>

      <title>Model selection for stochastic dynamics: a parsimonious and principled approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.
  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B} \ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model ($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more parameters than necessary when comparing many models.
  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC, cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model identification and predictive capability.
  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals ($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.
  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with stochastic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Where to Intervene: Action Selection in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has gained widespread adoption in recent years but faces significant challenges, particularly in unknown and complex environments. Among these, high-dimensional action selection stands out as a critical problem. Existing works often require a sophisticated prior design to eliminate redundancy in the action space, relying heavily on domain expert experience or involving high computational complexity, which limits their generalizability across different RL tasks. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a general data-driven action selection approach with model-free and computationally friendly properties. Our method not only selects minimal sufficient actions but also controls the false discovery rate via knockoff sampling. More importantly, we seamlessly integrate the action selection into deep RL methods during online training. Empirical experiments validate the established theoretical guarantees, demonstrating that our method surpasses various alternative techniques in terms of both performance in variable selection and overall achieved rewards.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Sample SGD: an End-to-end Analysis of Supervised Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$ rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real datasets support the theory.</description>

      <title>Inertial Quadratic Majorization Minimization with Application to Kernel Regularized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order methods in convex optimization offer low per-iteration cost but often suffer from slow convergence, while second-order methods achieve fast local convergence at the expense of costly Hessian inversions. In this paper, we highlight a middle ground: minimizing a quadratic majorant with fixed curvature at each iteration. This strategy strikes a balance between per-iteration cost and convergence speed, and crucially allows the reuse of matrix decompositions, such as Cholesky or spectral decompositions, across iterations and varying regularization parameters. We introduce the Quadratic Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation (QMME) framework and establish its sequential convergence properties under standard assumptions. The new perspective of our analysis is to center the arguments around the induced norm of the curvature matrix $H$. To demonstrate practical advantages, we apply QMME to large-scale kernel regularized learning problems. In particular, we propose a novel Sylvester equation modelling technique for kernel multinomial regression. In Julia-based experiments, QMME compares favorably against various established first- and second-order methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our algorithms complement existing kernel approximation techniques through more efficiently handling sketching matrices with large projection dimensions. Our numerical experiments and real data analysis are available and fully reproducible at https://github.com/qhengncsu/QMME.jl.</description>

      <title>Bandit Pareto Set Identification in a Multi-Output Linear Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Pareto Set Identification (PSI) problem in a structured multi-output linear bandit model. In this setting, each arm is associated a feature vector belonging to $\mathbb{R}^h$, and its mean vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$ linearly depends on this feature vector through a common unknown matrix $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times d}$. The goal is to identify the set of non-dominated arms by adaptively collecting samples from the arms. We introduce and analyze the first optimal design-based algorithms for PSI, providing nearly optimal guarantees in both the fixed-budget and the fixed-confidence settings. Notably, we show that the difficulty of these tasks mainly depends on the sub-optimality gaps of $h$ arms only. Our theoretical results are supported by an extensive benchmark on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Perplexity Bound and Ratio Matching in Discrete Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions, their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and generation.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Tamed Milstein Approximation of SDEs with Additive Symmetric Jump Noise Driven by a Poisson Random Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to estimate the drift and diffusion functions in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by a particular class of L\'evy processes with finite jump intensity, using neural networks. We propose a framework that integrates the Tamed-Milstein scheme with neural networks employed as non-parametric function approximators. Estimation is carried out in a non-parametric fashion for the drift function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \), the diffusion coefficient \( g: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \). The model of interest is given by \[ dX(t) = \xi + f(X(t))\, dt + g(X(t))\, dW_t + \gamma \int_{\mathbb{Z}} z\, N(dt,dz), \] where \( W_t \) is a standard Brownian motion, and \( N(dt,dz) \) is a Poisson random measure on \( (~\mathbb{R}_{+} ~\times ~\mathbb{Z}~, ~\mathcal{B}~(~\mathbb{R}_{+}~)~\otimes~\mathcal{Z}~,~ \lambda( \Lambda~\otimes~v~)~) \), with \( \lambda, \gamma &gt; 0 \), \( \Lambda \) being the Lebesgue measure on \( \mathbb{R}_{+} \), and \( v \) a finite measure on the measurable space \( (\mathbb{Z}, \mathcal{Z}) \).
  Neural networks are used as non-parametric function approximators, enabling the modeling of complex nonlinear dynamics without assuming restrictive functional forms. The proposed methodology constitutes a flexible alternative for inference in systems with state-dependent noise and discontinuities driven by L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>The Joys of Categorical Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges (and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break coverage.</description>

      <title>Optimal Model Selection for Conformalized Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In decision-making under uncertainty, Contextual Robust Optimization (CRO) provides reliability by minimizing the worst-case decision loss over a prediction set, hedging against label variability. While recent advances use conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for machine learning models, the downstream decisions critically depend on model selection. This paper introduces novel model selection frameworks for CRO that unify robustness control with decision risk minimization. We first propose Conformalized Robust Optimization with Model Selection (CROMS), which automatically selects models to approximately minimize the average decision risk in CRO solutions. We develop two algorithms: E-CROMS, which is computationally efficient, and F-CROMS, which enjoys a marginal robustness guarantee in finite samples. Further, we introduce Conformalized Robust Optimization with Individualized Model Selection (CROiMS), which performs individualized model selection by minimizing the conditional decision risk given the covariate of test data. This framework advances conformal prediction methodology by enabling covariate-aware model selection. Theoretically, CROiMS achieves asymptotic conditional robustness and decision efficiency under mild assumptions. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in decision efficiency and robustness across diverse synthetic and real-world applications, outperforming baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Intervening to learn and compose disentangled representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In designing generative models, it is commonly believed that in order to learn useful latent structure, we face a fundamental tension between expressivity and structure. In this paper we challenge this view by proposing a new approach to training arbitrarily expressive generative models that simultaneously learn disentangled latent structure. This is accomplished by adding a simple decoder-only module to the head of an existing decoder block that can be arbitrarily complex. The module learns to process concept information by implicitly inverting linear representations from an encoder. Inspired by the notion of intervention in causal graphical models, our module selectively modifies its architecture during training, allowing it to learn a compact joint model over different contexts. We show how adding this module leads to disentangled representations that can be composed for out-of-distribution generation. To further validate our proposed approach, we prove a new identifiability result that extends existing work on identifying structured representations in nonlinear models.</description>

      <title>Sure Convergence and Constructive Universal Approximation for Multi-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network model, 01Neuro, built on indicator activation neurons. Its boosted variant possesses two key statistical properties: (1) Sure Convergence, where model optimization can be achieved with high probability given sufficient computational resources; and (2) Constructive Universal Approximation: In the infinite sample setting, the model can approximate any finite sum of measurable functions, each depending on only k out of p input features, provided the architecture is properly tuned. Unlike most universal approximation results that are agnostic to training procedures, our guarantees are directly tied to the model's explicit construction and optimization algorithm. To improve prediction stability, we integrate stochastic training and bagging into the boosted 01Neuro framework. Empirical evaluations on simulated and real-world tabular datasets with small to medium sample sizes highlight its strengths: effective approximation of interaction components (multiplicative terms), stable prediction performance (comparable to Random Forests), robustness to many noisy features, and insensitivity to feature scaling. A major limitation of the current implementation of boosted 01Neuro is its higher computational cost, which is approximately 5 to 30 times that of Random Forests and XGBoost.</description>

      <title>Vecchia-Inducing-Points Full-Scale Approximations for Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely used in machine learning and statistics. However, their scalability to large data sets is limited by computational constraints. To overcome these challenges, we propose Vecchia-inducing-points full-scale (VIF) approximations combining the strengths of global inducing points and local Vecchia approximations. Vecchia approximations excel in settings with low-dimensional inputs and moderately smooth covariance functions, while inducing point methods are better suited to high-dimensional inputs and smoother covariance functions. Our VIF approach bridges these two regimes by using an efficient correlation-based neighbor-finding strategy for the Vecchia approximation of the residual process, implemented via a modified cover tree algorithm. We further extend our framework to non-Gaussian likelihoods by introducing iterative methods that substantially reduce computational costs for training and prediction by several orders of magnitudes compared to Cholesky-based computations when using a Laplace approximation. In particular, we propose and compare novel preconditioners and provide theoretical convergence results. Extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data sets show that VIF approximations are both computationally efficient as well as more accurate and numerically stable than state-of-the-art alternatives. All methods are implemented in the open source C++ library GPBoost with high-level Python and R interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Manage Production on Industry 4.0: Forecasting Overall Equipment Efficiency by Time Series with Topological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) is a key manufacturing KPI, but its volatile nature complicates short-term forecasting. This study presents a novel framework combining time series decomposition and topological data analysis to improve OEE prediction across various equipment, such as hydraulic press systems.
  Methods: The approach begins by decomposing hourly OEE data into trend, seasonal, and residual components. The residual, capturing short-term variability, is modeled using a seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables (SARIMAX). These exogenous features include statistical descriptors and topological summaries from related time series. To manage the high-dimensional input space, we propose a hybrid feature selection strategy using recursive feature elimination based on statistically significant SARIMAX predictors, coupled with BIC-guided particle swarm optimization. The framework is evaluated on real-world datasets from multiple production systems.
  Results: The proposed model consistently outperforms conventional time series models and advanced transformer-based approaches, achieving significantly lower mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error.
  Conclusion: Integrating classical forecasting with topological data analysis enhances OEE prediction accuracy, enabling proactive maintenance and informed production decisions in complex manufacturing environments.</description>

      <title>Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs), the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning. We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment understanding.</description>

      <title>A Weakly Supervised Transformer to Support Rare Disease Diagnosis from Electronic Health Records: Methods and Applications in Rare Pulmonary Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised, transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for clinical care and research applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Euclid: Curvature-Adaptive Generalization for Neural Networks on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry, which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep learning on structured data domains.</description>

      <title>Multiple data-driven missing imputation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces KZImputer, a novel adaptive imputation method for univariate time series designed for short to medium-sized missed points (gaps) (1-5 points and beyond) with tailored strategies for segments at the start, middle, or end of the series. KZImputer employs a hybrid strategy to handle various missing data scenarios. Its core mechanism differentiates between gaps at the beginning, middle, or end of the series, applying tailored techniques at each position to optimize imputation accuracy. The method leverages linear interpolation and localized statistical measures, adapting to the characteristics of the surrounding data and the gap size. The performance of KZImputer has been systematically evaluated against established imputation techniques, demonstrating its potential to enhance data quality for subsequent time series analysis. This paper describes the KZImputer methodology in detail and discusses its effectiveness in improving the integrity of time series data. Empirical analysis demonstrates that KZImputer achieves particularly strong performance for datasets with high missingness rates (around 50% or more), maintaining stable and competitive results across statistical and signal-reconstruction metrics. The method proves especially effective in high-sparsity regimes, where traditional approaches typically experience accuracy degradation.</description>

      <title>Conformal Information Pursuit for Interactively Guiding Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with 20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering greater interpretability.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom for Linear Attention: Distilling Softmax Attention with Optimal Feature Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty (sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE &lt; 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2 + sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples (delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep &lt;= 0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep causal-effect models.</description>

      <title>Skewed Score: A statistical framework to assess autograders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity, and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling both performance analysis and bias detection.</description>

      <title>IMPACT: Importance-Aware Activation Space Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size. Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy. Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to 48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Regularizing Log-Linear Cost Models for Inpatient Stays by Merging ICD-10 Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy, and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters (e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.</description>

      <title>Latent FxLMS: Accelerating Active Noise Control with Neural Adaptive Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC), wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.</description>

      <title>Transformer with Koopman-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Dynamics Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons, demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures and nonlinear temporal dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm. Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Powered Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2) estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.</description>

      <title>Risk-sensitive Actor-Critic with Static Spectral Risk Measures for Online and Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover, through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and offline environments across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Return of the Latent Space COWBOYS: Re-thinking the use of VAEs for Bayesian Optimisation of Structured Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains, such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths -- structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation budgets.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data, like TabPFN, achieve strong performance on small datasets when pre-trained solely on synthetic data. We show that this performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN, achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML Benchmark.</description>

Abstract: The ability to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with constraints is instrumental in improving the fairness of modern machine-learning models. Many algorithms have been analysed in recent years, and yet there is no standard, widely accepted method for the constrained training of DNNs. In this paper, we provide a challenging benchmark of real-world large-scale fairness-constrained learning tasks, built on top of the US Census (Folktables). We point out the theoretical challenges of such tasks and review the main approaches in stochastic approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the benchmark by implementing and comparing three recently proposed, but as-of-yet unimplemented, algorithms both in terms of optimization performance, and fairness improvement. We release the code of the benchmark as a Python package at https://github.com/humancompatible/train.</description>

      <title>Attributing Data for Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However, challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions (IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters. In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your LLM Web Agent: A Statistical Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close the gap with closed-source models.</description>

      <title>Generative Regression with IQ-BART</title>

Abstract: Implicit Quantile BART (IQ-BART) posits a non-parametric Bayesian model on the conditional quantile function, acting as a model over a conditional model for $Y$ given $X$. One of the key ingredients is augmenting the observed data $\{(Y_i,X_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ with uniformly sampled values $\tau_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$ which serve as training data for quantile function estimation. Using the fact that the location parameter $\mu$ in a $\tau$-tilted asymmetric Laplace distribution corresponds to the $\tau^{th}$ quantile, we build a check-loss likelihood targeting $\mu$ as the parameter of interest. We equip the check-loss likelihood parametrized by $\mu=f(X,\tau)$ with a BART prior on $f(\cdot)$, allowing the conditional quantile function to vary both in $X$ and $\tau$. The posterior distribution over $\mu(\tau,X)$ can be then distilled for estimation of the {\em entire quantile function} as well as for assessing uncertainty through the variation of posterior draws. Simulation-based predictive inference is immediately available through inverse transform sampling using the learned quantile function. The sum-of-trees structure over the conditional quantile function enables flexible distribution-free regression with theoretical guarantees. As a byproduct, we investigate posterior mean quantile estimator as an alternative to the routine sample (posterior mode) quantile estimator. We demonstrate the power of IQ-BART on time series forecasting datasets where IQ-BART can capture multimodality in predictive distributions that might be otherwise missed using traditional parametric approaches.</description>

Abstract: The conditional density characterizes the distribution of a response variable $y$ given other predictor $x$, and plays a key role in many statistical tasks, including classification and outlier detection. Although there has been abundant work on the problem of Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) for a low-dimensional response in the presence of a high-dimensional predictor, little work has been done for a high-dimensional response such as images. The promising performance of normalizing flow (NF) neural networks in unconditional density estimation acts a motivating starting point. In this work, we extend NF neural networks when external $x$ is present. Specifically, they use the NF to parameterize a one-to-one transform between a high-dimensional $y$ and a latent $z$ that comprises two components \([z_P,z_N]\). The $z_P$ component is a low-dimensional subvector obtained from the posterior distribution of an elementary predictive model for $x$, such as logistic/linear regression. The $z_N$ component is a high-dimensional independent Gaussian vector, which explains the variations in $y$ not or less related to $x$. Unlike existing CDE methods, the proposed approach, coined Augmented Posterior CDE (AP-CDE), only requires a simple modification on the common normalizing flow framework, while significantly improving the interpretation of the latent component, since $z_P$ represents a supervised dimension reduction. In image analytics applications, AP-CDE shows good separation of $x$-related variations due to factors such as lighting condition and subject id, from the other random variations. Further, the experiments show that an unconditional NF neural network, based on an unsupervised model of $z$, such as Gaussian mixture, fails to generate interpretable results.</description>

      <title>Structural Classification of Locally Stationary Time Series Based on Second-order Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification is crucial for numerous scientific and engineering applications. In this article, we present a numerically efficient, practically competitive, and theoretically rigorous classification method for distinguishing between two classes of locally stationary time series based on their time-domain, second-order characteristics. Our approach builds on the autoregressive approximation for locally stationary time series, combined with an ensemble aggregation and a distance-based threshold for classification. It imposes no requirement on the training sample size, and is shown to achieve zero misclassification error rate asymptotically when the underlying time series differ only mildly in their second-order characteristics. The new method is demonstrated to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art solutions, including wavelet-based, tree-based, convolution-based methods, as well as modern deep learning methods, through intensive numerical simulations and a real EEG data analysis for epilepsy classification.</description>

      <title>Consistent Labeling Across Group Assignments: Variance Reduction in Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements with CLAGA.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic Quantification of High-order Feature Effects in Classification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based on interaction analysis.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Sample Complexity of First-Order Methods for Agnostic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting, where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD) condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm \citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and \emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key assumption.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Bandits with Knapsacks with Improved Regret and Time Complexities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed light on operations research.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Infinite Width Feature Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling, feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment on the utility of transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Does Overnight News Explain Overnight Returns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4 million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain overnight returns.</description>

      <title>Dealing with Uncertainty in Contextual Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target (behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD, normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive, uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in domains such as healthcare.</description>

      <title>AL-SPCE -- Reliability analysis for nondeterministic models using stochastic polynomial chaos expansions and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliability analysis typically relies on deterministic simulators, which yield repeatable outputs for identical inputs. However, many real-world systems display intrinsic randomness, requiring stochastic simulators whose outputs are random variables. This inherent variability must be accounted for in reliability analysis. While Monte Carlo methods can handle this, their high computational cost is often prohibitive. To address this, stochastic emulators have emerged as efficient surrogate models capable of capturing the random response of simulators at reduced cost. Although promising, current methods still require large training sets to produce accurate reliability estimates, which limits their practicality for expensive simulations. This work introduces an active learning framework to further reduce the computational burden of reliability analysis using stochastic emulators. We focus on stochastic polynomial chaos expansions (SPCE) and propose a novel learning function that targets regions of high predictive uncertainty relevant to failure probability estimation. To quantify this uncertainty, we exploit the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. The resulting method, named active learning stochastic polynomial chaos expansions (AL-SPCE), is applied to three test cases. Results demonstrate that AL-SPCE maintains high accuracy in reliability estimates while significantly improving efficiency compared to conventional surrogate-based methods and direct Monte Carlo simulation. This confirms the potential of active learning in enhancing the practicality of stochastic reliability analysis for complex, computationally expensive models.</description>

      <title>A General Class of Model-Free Dense Precision Matrix Estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce prototype consistent model-free, dense precision matrix estimators that have broad application in economics. Using quadratic form concentration inequalities and novel algebraic characterizations of confounding dimension reductions, we are able to: (i) obtain non-asymptotic bounds for precision matrix estimation errors and also (ii) consistency in high dimensions; (iii) uncover the existence of an intrinsic signal-to-noise -- underlying dimensions tradeoff; and (iv) avoid exact population sparsity assumptions. In addition to its desirable theoretical properties, a thorough empirical study of the S&amp;P 500 index shows that a tuning parameter-free special case of our general estimator exhibits a doubly ascending Sharpe Ratio pattern, thereby establishing a link with the famous double descent phenomenon dominantly present in recent statistical and machine learning literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems. This problem can be regarded as an extension of a maximum entropy optimal control problem (MEOCP). Differently from the MEOCP where the prior is fixed to the uniform distribution, the MIOCP optimizes the policy and prior simultaneously. As analytical results, under the policy and prior classes consisting of Gaussian distributions, we derive the optimal policy and prior of the MIOCP with the prior and policy fixed, respectively. Using the results, we propose an alternating minimization algorithm for the MIOCP. Through numerical experiments, we discuss how our proposed algorithm works.</description>

      <title>Distribution-dependent Generalization Bounds for Tuning Linear Regression Across Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2 coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness" of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression, where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean of the ground truth distribution.</description>

      <title>DICE: Discrete inverse continuity equation for learning population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics, rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves, Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify these assertions.</description>

      <title>QuEst: Enhancing Estimates of Quantile-Based Distributional Measures Using Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology, education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model auto-evaluation.</description>

      <title>Non-negative matrix factorization algorithms generally improve topic model fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an effort to develop topic modeling methods that can be quickly applied to large data sets, we revisit the problem of maximum-likelihood estimation in topic models. It is known, at least informally, that maximum-likelihood estimation in topic models is closely related to non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Yet, to our knowledge, this relationship has not been exploited previously to fit topic models. We show that recent advances in NMF optimization methods can be leveraged to fit topic models very efficiently, often resulting in much better fits and in less time than existing algorithms for topic models. We also formally make the connection between the NMF optimization problem and maximum-likelihood estimation for the topic model, and using this result we show that the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the topic model is essentially the same as the classic multiplicative updates for NMF (the only difference being that the operations are performed in a different order). Our methods are implemented in the R package fastTopics.</description>

      <title>Mixtures of Gaussian Process Experts with SMC$^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are a key component of many flexible statistical and machine learning models. However, they exhibit cubic computational complexity and high memory constraints due to the need of inverting and storing a full covariance matrix. To circumvent this, mixtures of Gaussian process experts have been considered where data points are assigned to independent experts, reducing the complexity by allowing inference based on smaller, local covariance matrices. Moreover, mixtures of Gaussian process experts substantially enrich the model's flexibility, allowing for behaviors such as non-stationarity, heteroscedasticity, and discontinuities. In this work, we construct a novel inference approach based on nested sequential Monte Carlo samplers to simultaneously infer both the gating network and Gaussian process expert parameters. This greatly improves inference compared to importance sampling, particularly in settings when a stationary Gaussian process is inappropriate, while still being thoroughly parallelizable.</description>

      <title>Learning from Similar Linear Representations: Adaptivity, Minimaxity, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17765v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation multi-task learning (MTL) has achieved tremendous success in practice. However, the theoretical understanding of these methods is still lacking. Most existing theoretical works focus on cases where all tasks share the same representation, and claim that MTL almost always improves performance. Nevertheless, as the number of tasks grows, assuming all tasks share the same representation is unrealistic. Furthermore, empirical findings often indicate that a shared representation does not necessarily improve single-task learning performance. In this paper, we aim to understand how to learn from tasks with \textit{similar but not exactly the same} linear representations, while dealing with outlier tasks. Assuming a known intrinsic dimension, we propose a penalized empirical risk minimization method and a spectral method that are \textit{adaptive} to the similarity structure and \textit{robust} to outlier tasks. Both algorithms outperform single-task learning when representations across tasks are sufficiently similar and the proportion of outlier tasks is small. Moreover, they always perform at least as well as single-task learning, even when the representations are dissimilar. We provide information-theoretic lower bounds to demonstrate that both methods are nearly \textit{minimax} optimal in a large regime, with the spectral method being optimal in the absence of outlier tasks. Additionally, we introduce a thresholding algorithm to adapt to an unknown intrinsic dimension. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The geometry of financial institutions -- Wasserstein clustering of financial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing availability of granular and big data on various objects of interest has made it necessary to develop methods for condensing this information into a representative and intelligible map. Financial regulation is a field that exemplifies this need, as regulators require diverse and often highly granular data from financial institutions to monitor and assess their activities. However, processing and analyzing such data can be a daunting task, especially given the challenges of dealing with missing values and identifying clusters based on specific features.
  To address these challenges, we propose a variant of Lloyd's algorithm that applies to probability distributions and uses generalized Wasserstein barycenters to construct a metric space which represents given data on various objects in condensed form. By applying our method to the financial regulation context, we demonstrate its usefulness in dealing with the specific challenges faced by regulators in this domain. We believe that our approach can also be applied more generally to other fields where large and complex data sets need to be represented in concise form.</description>

      <title>On the quality of randomized approximations of Tukey's depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tukey's depth (or halfspace depth) is a widely used measure of centrality for multivariate data. However, exact computation of Tukey's depth is known to be a hard problem in high dimensions. As a remedy, randomized approximations of Tukey's depth have been proposed. In this paper we explore when such randomized algorithms return a good approximation of Tukey's depth. We study the case when the data are sampled from a log-concave isotropic distribution. We prove that, if one requires that the algorithm runs in polynomial time in the dimension, the randomized algorithm correctly approximates the maximal depth $1/2$ and depths close to zero. On the other hand, for any point of intermediate depth, any good approximation requires exponential complexity.</description>

      <title>The surrogate Gibbs-posterior of a corrected stochastic MALA: Towards uncertainty quantification for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MALA is a popular gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo method to access the Gibbs-posterior distribution. Stochastic MALA (sMALA) scales to large data sets, but changes the target distribution from the Gibbs-posterior to a surrogate posterior which only exploits a reduced sample size. We introduce a corrected stochastic MALA (csMALA) with a simple correction term for which distance between the resulting surrogate posterior and the original Gibbs-posterior decreases in the full sample size while retaining scalability. In a nonparametric regression model, we prove a PAC-Bayes oracle inequality for the surrogate posterior. Uncertainties can be quantified by sampling from the surrogate posterior. Focusing on Bayesian neural networks, we analyze the diameter and coverage of credible balls for shallow neural networks and we show optimal contraction rates for deep neural networks. Our credibility result is independent of the correction and can also be applied to the standard Gibbs-posterior. A simulation study in a high-dimensional parameter space demonstrates that an estimator drawn from csMALA based on its surrogate Gibbs-posterior indeed exhibits these advantages in practice.</description>

      <title>Model-free Posterior Sampling via Learning Rate Randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Randomized Q-learning (RandQL), a novel randomized model-free algorithm for regret minimization in episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). To the best of our knowledge, RandQL is the first tractable model-free posterior sampling-based algorithm. We analyze the performance of RandQL in both tabular and non-tabular metric space settings. In tabular MDPs, RandQL achieves a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^{5}SAT})$, where $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is the number of episodes. For a metric state-action space, RandQL enjoys a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}(H^{5/2} T^{(d_z+1)/(d_z+2)})$, where $d_z$ denotes the zooming dimension. Notably, RandQL achieves optimistic exploration without using bonuses, relying instead on a novel idea of learning rate randomization. Our empirical study shows that RandQL outperforms existing approaches on baseline exploration environments.</description>

Abstract: Feature importance scores are ubiquitous tools for understanding the predictions of machine learning models. However, many popular attribution methods suffer from high instability due to random sampling. Leveraging novel ideas from hypothesis testing, we devise techniques that ensure the most important features are correct with high-probability guarantees. These assess the set of $K$ top-ranked features, as well as the order of its elements. Given a set of local or global importance scores, we demonstrate how to retrospectively verify the stability of the highest ranks. We then introduce two efficient sampling algorithms that identify the $K$ most important features, perhaps in order, with probability exceeding $1-\alpha$. The theoretical justification for these procedures is validated empirically on SHAP and LIME.</description>

      <title>Training-Conditional Coverage Bounds under Covariate Shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction methodology has recently been extended to the covariate shift setting, where the distribution of covariates differs between training and test data. While existing results ensure that the prediction sets from these methods achieve marginal coverage above a nominal level, their coverage rate conditional on the training dataset (referred to as training-conditional coverage) remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving upper bounds on the tail of the training-conditional coverage distribution, offering probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees for these methods. Our results quantify the relationship between the quality of the prediction sets and the severity of distributional changes, and can potentially be used to compute more efficient prediction sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning is important in many settings with available observational data but the inability to deploy new policies online due to safety, cost, and other concerns. Many recent advances in causal inference and machine learning target estimation of causal contrast functions such as CATE, which is sufficient for optimizing decisions and can adapt to potentially smoother structure. We develop a dynamic generalization of the R-learner (Nie and Wager 2021, Lewis and Syrgkanis 2021) for estimating and optimizing the difference of $Q^\pi$-functions, $Q^\pi(s,1)-Q^\pi(s,0)$ (which can be used to optimize multiple-valued actions). We leverage orthogonal estimation to improve convergence rates in the presence of slower nuisance estimation rates and prove consistency of policy optimization under a margin condition. The method can leverage black-box nuisance estimators of the $Q$-function and behavior policy to target estimation of a more structured $Q$-function contrast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating graph limits, known as graphons, from observations of sequences of sparse finite graphs. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. This enables the use of results on graph limits of dense graphs to derive convergence. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. We demonstrate empirically that we can distinguish different numbers of stars (which are sparse) by the graphons of their corresponding line graphs. Whereas in the original graphs, the different number of stars all converge to the zero graphon due to sparsity. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations for Independence Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many tools exist to detect dependence between random variables, a core question across a wide range of machine learning, statistical, and scientific endeavors. Although several statistical tests guarantee eventual detection of any dependence with enough samples, standard tests may require an exorbitant amount of samples for detecting subtle dependencies between high-dimensional random variables with complex distributions. In this work, we study two related ways to learn powerful independence tests. First, we show how to construct powerful statistical tests with finite-sample validity by using variational estimators of mutual information, such as the InfoNCE or NWJ estimators. Second, we establish a close connection between these variational mutual information-based tests and tests based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC); in particular, learning a variational bound (typically parameterized by a deep network) for mutual information is closely related to learning a kernel for HSIC. Finally, we show how to, rather than selecting a representation to maximize the statistic itself, select a representation which can maximize the power of a test, in either setting; we term the former case a Neural Dependency Statistic (NDS). While HSIC power optimization has been recently considered in the literature, we correct some important misconceptions and expand to considering deep kernels. In our experiments, while all approaches can yield powerful tests with exact level control, optimized HSIC tests generally outperform the other approaches on difficult problems of detecting structured dependence.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks beyond compact domains, which is of particular interest for the approximation within weighted $C^k$-spaces and weighted Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we establish universal approximation results within function spaces defined over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, including $L^p$-spaces, weighted $C^k$-spaces, and weighted Sobolev spaces, where the latter two include the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Moreover, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics for Deep-space Habitats Exhibiting Multiple Unlabeled Failure Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep-space habitats are complex systems that must operate autonomously over extended durations without ground-based maintenance. These systems are vulnerable to multiple, often unknown, failure modes that affect different subsystems and sensors in mode-specific ways. Developing accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prognostics is challenging, especially when failure labels are unavailable and sensor relevance varies by failure mode. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised prognostics framework that jointly identifies latent failure modes and selects informative sensors using only unlabeled training data. The methodology consists of two phases. In the offline phase, we model system failure times using a mixture of Gaussian regressions and apply a novel Expectation-Maximization algorithm to cluster degradation trajectories and select mode-specific sensors. In the online phase, we extract low-dimensional features from the selected sensors to diagnose the active failure mode and predict RUL using a weighted regression model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a simulated dataset that reflects deep-space telemetry characteristics and on a real-world engine degradation dataset, showing improved accuracy and interpretability over existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing relationships between objects is a pivotal problem within data science. In this context, Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are employed to generate smaller and more manageable data representations. This paper proposes a new method for dimensionality reduction, based on optimal transportation theory and the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We offer a new probabilistic view of the classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm and the nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, Isomap (Isometric Mapping or Isometric Feature Mapping) that extends the classical MDS, in which we use the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the probability measure of high-dimensional data, and its low-dimensional representation. Through gradient descent, our method embeds high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, providing a robust and efficient solution for analyzing complex high-dimensional datasets.</description>

Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem that accounts for partially observable features. Without proper handling, unobserved features can lead to linear regret in the decision horizon $T$, as their influence on rewards is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel theoretical framework and an algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees. The core of our algorithm consists of: (i) feature augmentation, by appending basis vectors that are orthogonal to the row space of the observed features; and (ii) the introduction of a doubly robust estimator. Our approach achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(d + d_h)T})$, where $d$ denotes the dimension of the observed features, and $d_h$ represents the number of nonzero coefficients in the parameter associated with the reward component projected onto the subspace orthogonal to the row space spanned by the observed features. Notably, our algorithm requires no prior knowledge of the unobserved feature space, which may expand as more features become hidden. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms both non-contextual multi-armed bandits and linear bandit algorithms depending solely on observed features.</description>

      <title>Confidence Intervals for Evaluation of Data Mining</title>

Abstract: In data mining, when binary prediction rules are used to predict a binary outcome, many performance measures are used in a vast array of literature for the purposes of evaluation and comparison. Some examples include classification accuracy, precision, recall, F measures, and Jaccard index. Typically, these performance measures are only approximately estimated from a finite dataset, which may lead to findings that are not statistically significant. In order to properly quantify such statistical uncertainty, it is important to provide confidence intervals associated with these estimated performance measures. We consider statistical inference about general performance measures used in data mining, with both individual and joint confidence intervals. These confidence intervals are based on asymptotic normal approximations and can be computed fast, without needs to do bootstrap resampling. We study the finite sample coverage probabilities for these confidence intervals and also propose a `blurring correction' on the variance to improve the finite sample performance. This 'blurring correction' generalizes the plus-four method from binomial proportion to general performance measures used in data mining. Our framework allows multiple performance measures of multiple classification rules to be inferred simultaneously for comparisons.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Disentanglement by Backpropagation with Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference and prediction under partial knowledge of a physical system is challenging, particularly when multiple confounding sources influence the measured response. Explicitly accounting for these influences in physics-based models is often infeasible due to epistemic uncertainty, cost, or time constraints, resulting in models that fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as variational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious representation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy data. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that combines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of data-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and confounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically meaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven variables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical system. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and data-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective that prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics, ensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We demonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal and separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in the form of class and domain observables. The model is evaluated on a series of synthetic case studies relevant to engineering structures, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Fault Sneaking Attack: a Stealthy Framework for Misleading Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.12032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the great achievements of deep neural networks (DNNs), the vulnerability of state-of-the-art DNNs raises security concerns of DNNs in many application domains requiring high reliability.We propose the fault sneaking attack on DNNs, where the adversary aims to misclassify certain input images into any target labels by modifying the DNN parameters. We apply ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) for solving the optimization problem of the fault sneaking attack with two constraints: 1) the classification of the other images should be unchanged and 2) the parameter modifications should be minimized. Specifically, the first constraint requires us not only to inject designated faults (misclassifications), but also to hide the faults for stealthy or sneaking considerations by maintaining model accuracy. The second constraint requires us to minimize the parameter modifications (using L0 norm to measure the number of modifications and L2 norm to measure the magnitude of modifications). Comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework can inject multiple sneaking faults without losing the overall test accuracy performance.</description>

      <title>Selective Prediction via Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13532v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selective Prediction is the task of rejecting inputs a model would predict incorrectly on. This involves a trade-off between input space coverage (how many data points are accepted) and model utility (how good is the performance on accepted data points). Current methods for selective prediction typically impose constraints on either the model architecture or the optimization objective; this inhibits their usage in practice and introduces unknown interactions with pre-existing loss functions. In contrast to prior work, we show that state-of-the-art selective prediction performance can be attained solely from studying the (discretized) training dynamics of a model. We propose a general framework that, given a test input, monitors metrics capturing the instability of predictions from intermediate models (i.e., checkpoints) obtained during training w.r.t. the final model's prediction. In particular, we reject data points exhibiting too much disagreement with the final prediction at late stages in training. The proposed rejection mechanism is domain-agnostic (i.e., it works for both discrete and real-valued prediction) and can be flexibly combined with existing selective prediction approaches as it does not require any train-time modifications. Our experimental evaluation on image classification, regression, and time series problems shows that our method beats past state-of-the-art accuracy/utility trade-offs on typical selective prediction benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Online Estimation with Rolling Validation: Adaptive Nonparametric Estimation with Streaming Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12140v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online nonparametric estimators are gaining popularity due to their efficient computation and competitive generalization abilities. An important example includes variants of stochastic gradient descent. These algorithms often take one sample point at a time and incrementally update the parameter estimate of interest. In this work, we consider model selection/hyperparameter tuning for such online algorithms. We propose a weighted rolling validation procedure, an online variant of leave-one-out cross-validation, that costs minimal extra computation for many typical stochastic gradient descent estimators and maintains their online nature. Similar to batch cross-validation, it can boost base estimators to achieve better heuristic performance and adaptive convergence rate. Our analysis is straightforward, relying mainly on some general statistical stability assumptions. The simulation study underscores the significance of diverging weights in practice and demonstrates its favorable sensitivity even when there is only a slim difference between candidate estimators.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Solve Non-Linear and Non-Markovian Filtering Problems in Continuous Time For Conditionally Gaussian Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of attention-based deep learning models in stochastic filtering, e.g.\ transformers and deep Kalman filters, has recently come into focus; however, the potential for these models to solve stochastic filtering problems remains largely unknown. The paper provides an affirmative answer to this open problem in the theoretical foundations of machine learning by showing that a class of continuous-time transformer models, called \textit{filterformers}, can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-time (possibly non-Gaussian) measurements. Our approximation guarantees hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of continuous-time paths, where the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance between the true optimal filter and our deep learning model quantifies the approximation error. Our construction relies on two new customizations of the standard attention mechanism: The first can losslessly adapt to the characteristics of a broad range of paths since we show that the attention mechanism implements bi-Lipschitz embeddings of sufficiently regular sets of paths into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces; thus, it incurs no ``dimension reduction error''. The latter attention mechanism is tailored to the geometry of Gaussian measures in the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis relies on new stability estimates of robust optimal filters in the conditionally Gaussian setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08214v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to analyze large, decentralized datasets, distributed Bayesian inference has become a critical research area across multiple fields, including statistics, electrical engineering, and economics. This paper establishes Frequentist properties, such as posterior consistency, asymptotic normality, and posterior contraction rates, for the distributed (non-)Bayes Inference problem among agents connected via a communication network. Our results show that, under appropriate assumptions on the communication graph, distributed Bayesian inference retains parametric efficiency while enhancing robustness in uncertainty quantification. We also explore the trade-off between statistical efficiency and communication efficiency by examining how the design and size of the communication graph impact the posterior contraction rate. Furthermore, We extend our analysis to time-varying graphs and apply our results to exponential family models, distributed logistic regression, and decentralized detection models.</description>

      <title>Forecast Evaluation and the Relationship of Regret and Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is about forecasting. When the forecasts come with an evaluation metric the forecasts become useful. What are reasonable evaluation metrics? How do existing evaluation metrics relate? In this work, we provide a general structure which subsumes many currently used evaluation metrics in a two-dimensional hierarchy, e.g., external and swap regret, loss scores, and calibration scores. The framework embeds those evaluation metrics in a large set of single-instance-based comparisons of forecasts and observations which respect a meta-criterion for reasonable forecast evaluations which we term ``fairness''. In particular, this framework sheds light on the relationship on regret-type and calibration-type evaluation metrics showing a theoretical equivalence in their ability to evaluate, but practical incomparability of the obtained scores.</description>

      <title>PIP-Net: Pedestrian Intention Prediction in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention prediction (PIP) by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is one of the current research challenges in this field. In this article, we introduce PIP-Net, a novel framework designed to predict pedestrian crossing intentions by AVs in real-world urban scenarios. We offer two variants of PIP-Net designed for different camera mounts and setups. Leveraging both kinematic data and spatial features from the driving scene, the proposed model employs a recurrent and temporal attention-based solution, outperforming state-of-the-art performance. To enhance the visual representation of road users and their proximity to the ego vehicle, we introduce a categorical depth feature map, combined with a local motion flow feature, providing rich insights into the scene dynamics. Additionally, we explore the impact of expanding the camera's field of view, from one to three cameras surrounding the ego vehicle, leading to an enhancement in the model's contextual perception. Depending on the traffic scenario and road environment, the model excels in predicting pedestrian crossing intentions up to 4 seconds in advance, which is a breakthrough in current research studies in pedestrian intention prediction. Finally, for the first time, we present the Urban-PIP dataset, a customised pedestrian intention prediction dataset, with multi-camera annotations in real-world automated driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deep Autoregressive Models as Causal Inference Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing causal inference (CI) models are often restricted to data with low-dimensional confounders and singleton actions. We propose an autoregressive (AR) CI framework capable of handling complex confounders and sequential actions commonly found in modern applications. Our approach accomplishes this using {\em sequencification}, which transforms data from an underlying causal diagram into a sequence of tokens. Sequencification not only accommodates training with data generated from a large class of DAGs, but also extends existing CI capabilities to estimate multiple causal quantities using a {\em single} model. We can directly compute probabilities from interventional distributions, simplifying inference and improving outcome prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that an AR model adapted for CI is efficient and effective in various complex applications such as navigating mazes, playing chess endgames, and evaluating the impact of certain keywords on paper acceptance rates, where we consider causal queries beyond standard reinforcement learning-type questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a principled and simplified design of the projector and loss function for non-contrastive self-supervised learning based on hyperdimensional computing. We theoretically demonstrate that this design introduces an inductive bias that encourages representations to be simultaneously decorrelated and clustered, without explicitly enforcing these properties. This bias provably enhances generalization and suffices to avoid known training failure modes, such as representation, dimensional, cluster, and intracluster collapses. We validate our theoretical findings on image datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100. Our approach effectively combines the strengths of feature decorrelation and cluster-based self-supervised learning methods, overcoming training failure modes while achieving strong generalization in clustering and linear classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes: Model Selection And Linear-Time Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model selection in Gaussian processes scales prohibitively with the size of the training dataset, both in time and memory. While many approximations exist, all incur inevitable approximation error. Recent work accounts for this error in the form of computational uncertainty, which enables -- at the cost of quadratic complexity -- an explicit tradeoff between computation and precision. Here we extend this development to model selection, which requires significant enhancements to the existing approach, including linear-time scaling in the size of the dataset. We propose a novel training loss for hyperparameter optimization and demonstrate empirically that the resulting method can outperform SGPR, CGGP and SVGP, state-of-the-art methods for GP model selection, on medium to large-scale datasets. Our experiments show that model selection for computation-aware GPs trained on 1.8 million data points can be done within a few hours on a single GPU. As a result of this work, Gaussian processes can be trained on large-scale datasets without significantly compromising their ability to quantify uncertainty -- a fundamental prerequisite for optimal decision-making.</description>

      <title>A Causal World Model Underlying Next Token Prediction: Exploring GPT in a Controlled Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07446v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learning a world model from which sequences are generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT and presenting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences, and introduce a corresponding confidence score. Empirical tests were conducted in controlled environments using the setups of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, was tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases where it generates illegal moves, it also fails to capture a causal structure.</description>

      <title>On consistent estimation of dimension values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating, from a random sample of points, the dimension of a compact subset $S$
  of the Euclidean space is considered. The emphasis is put on consistency results in the statistical sense. That is, statements of convergence to the true dimension value when the sample size grows to infinity.
  Among the many available definitions of dimension, we have focused (on the grounds of its statistical tractability) on three notions: the Minkowski dimension, the correlation dimension and the, perhaps less popular, concept of pointwise dimension.
  We prove the statistical consistency of some natural estimators of these quantities. Our proofs partially rely on the use of an instrumental estimator formulated in terms of the empirical volume function $V_n(r)$, defined as the Lebesgue measure of the set of points whose distance to the sample is at most $r$. In particular, we explore the case in which the true volume function $V(r)$ of the target set $S$ is a polynomial on some interval starting at zero. An empirical study is also included. Our study aims to provide some theoretical support, and some practical insights, for the problem of deciding whether or not the set $S$ has a dimension smaller than that of the ambient space. This is a major statistical motivation of the dimension studies, in connection with the so-called ``Manifold Hypothesis''.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Diffusion Models via Speculative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative sampling is a popular technique for accelerating inference in Large Language Models by generating candidate tokens using a fast draft model and accepting or rejecting them based on the target model's distribution. While speculative sampling was previously limited to discrete sequences, we extend it to diffusion models, which generate samples via continuous, vector-valued Markov chains. In this context, the target model is a high-quality but computationally expensive diffusion model. We propose various drafting strategies, including a simple and effective approach that does not require training a draft model and is applicable out of the box to any diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate significant generation speedup on various diffusion models, halving the number of function evaluations, while generating exact samples from the target model.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Parameter Learning in Linear Inverse Problems: Application in EEG Focal Source Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems can be described as limited-data problems in which the signal of interest cannot be observed directly. A physics-based forward model that relates the signal with the observations is typically needed. Unfortunately, unknown model parameters and imperfect forward models can undermine the signal recovery. Even though supervised machine learning offers promising avenues to improve the robustness of the solutions, we have to rely on model-based learning when there is no access to ground truth for the training. Here, we studied a linear inverse problem that included an unknown non-linear model parameter and utilized a Bayesian model-based learning approach that allowed signal recovery and subsequently estimation of the model parameter. This approach, called Bayesian Approximation Error approach, employed a simplified model of the physics of the problem augmented with an approximation error term that compensated for the simplification. An error subspace was spanned with the help of the eigenvectors of the approximation error covariance matrix which allowed, alongside the primary signal, simultaneous estimation of the induced error. The estimated error and signal were then used to determine the unknown model parameter. For the model parameter estimation, we tested different approaches: a conditional Gaussian regression, an iterative (model-based) optimization, and a Gaussian process that was modeled with the help of physics-informed learning. In addition, alternating optimization was used as a reference method. As an example application, we focused on the problem of reconstructing brain activity from EEG recordings under the condition that the electrical conductivity of the patient's skull was unknown in the model. Our results demonstrated clear improvements in EEG source localization accuracy and provided feasible estimates for the unknown model parameter, skull conductivity.</description>

      <title>Distributional Diffusion Models with Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate high-quality synthetic data. They operate by defining a continuous-time forward process which gradually adds Gaussian noise to data until fully corrupted. The corresponding reverse process progressively "denoises" a Gaussian sample into a sample from the data distribution. However, generating high-quality outputs requires many discretization steps to obtain a faithful approximation of the reverse process. This is expensive and has motivated the development of many acceleration methods. We propose to accomplish sample generation by learning the posterior {\em distribution} of clean data samples given their noisy versions, instead of only the mean of this distribution. This allows us to sample from the probability transitions of the reverse process on a coarse time scale, significantly accelerating inference with minimal degradation of the quality of the output. This is accomplished by replacing the standard regression loss used to estimate conditional means with a scoring rule. We validate our method on image and robot trajectory generation, where we consistently outperform standard diffusion models at few discretization steps.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent Beyond Compatible Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern policy optimization methods roughly follow the policy mirror descent (PMD) algorithmic template, for which there are by now numerous theoretical convergence results. However, most of these either target tabular environments, or can be applied effectively only when the class of policies being optimized over satisfies strong closure conditions, which is typically not the case when working with parametric policy classes in large-scale environments. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for PMD for general policy classes where we replace the closure conditions with a strictly weaker variational gradient dominance assumption, and obtain upper bounds on the rate of convergence to the best-in-class policy. Our main result leverages a novel notion of smoothness with respect to a local norm induced by the occupancy measure of the current policy, and casts PMD as a particular instance of smooth non-convex optimization in non-Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Contrastive PAC Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study contrastive learning under the PAC learning framework. While a series of recent works have shown statistical results for learning under contrastive loss, based either on the VC-dimension or Rademacher complexity, their algorithms are inherently inefficient or not implying PAC guarantees. In this paper, we consider contrastive learning of the fundamental concept of linear representations. Surprisingly, even under such basic setting, the existence of efficient PAC learners is largely open. We first show that the problem of contrastive PAC learning of linear representations is intractable to solve in general. We then show that it can be relaxed to a semi-definite program when the distance between contrastive samples is measured by the $\ell_2$-norm. We then establish generalization guarantees based on Rademacher complexity, and connect it to PAC guarantees under certain contrastive large-margin conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient PAC learning algorithm for contrastive learning.</description>

      <title>Posterior Inference with Diffusion Models for High-dimensional Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional and complex black-box functions is crucial in numerous scientific applications. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for sample-efficient optimization, it struggles with the curse of dimensionality and scaling to thousands of evaluations. Recently, leveraging generative models to solve black-box optimization problems has emerged as a promising framework. However, those methods often underperform compared to BO methods due to limited expressivity and difficulty of uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textbf{DiBO}, a novel framework for solving high-dimensional black-box optimization problems. Our method iterates two stages. First, we train a diffusion model to capture the data distribution and deep ensembles to predict function values with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection as a posterior inference problem to balance exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional spaces. Concretely, we fine-tune diffusion models to amortize posterior inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across synthetic and real-world tasks. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/umkiyoung/DiBO}{here}.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Active Learning for Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) or kernel ridge regression is a widely used and powerful tool for nonlinear prediction. Therefore, active learning (AL) for GPR, which actively collects data labels to achieve an accurate prediction with fewer data labels, is an important problem. However, existing AL methods do not theoretically guarantee prediction accuracy for target distribution. Furthermore, as discussed in the distributionally robust learning literature, specifying the target distribution is often difficult. Thus, this paper proposes two AL methods that effectively reduce the worst-case expected error for GPR, which is the worst-case expectation in target distribution candidates. We show an upper bound of the worst-case expected squared error, which suggests that the error will be arbitrarily small by a finite number of data labels under mild conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing variational quantum algorithms by balancing training on classical and quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer a promising route to tackling problems that are classically intractable such as in prime-factorization, solving large-scale linear algebra and simulating complex quantum systems, but potentially require fault-tolerant quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for leveraging near-term quantum computers to solve complex problems. However, there remain major challenges in their trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training methods that combine an existing classical-enhanced g-sim method and the quantum-based Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically evaluate our approach for ground-state estimation of 6 to 18-qubit Hamiltonians using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and quantum phase classification for up to 12-qubit Hamiltonians using quantum neural networks. For VQE, our method achieves higher accuracy and success rates, with an average reduction in quantum hardware calls of up to 60% compared to purely quantum-based PSR. For classification, we observe test accuracy improvements of up to 2.8%. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</description>

      <title>Decision Feedback In-Context Learning for Wireless Symbol Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Transformers, through in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to adapt to new tasks using example prompts without model update. Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high detection accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose DEcision Feedback IN-ContExt Detection (DEFINED) as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts as pseudo-labels to improve the detection for subsequent symbols. We further establish an error lower bound and provide theoretical insights into the model's generalization under channel distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless settings demonstrate that a small Transformer trained with DEFINED achieves significant performance improvements over conventional methods, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair to achieve similar performance to the latter with more than 4 pilot pairs.</description>

      <title>Breach in the Shield: Unveiling the Vulnerabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to carefully crafted perturbations. In this study, we seek to pinpoint the sources of this fragility by identifying parameters and input dimensions (pixels or token embeddings) that are susceptible to such perturbations. To this end, we propose a stability measure called \textbf{FI}, \textbf{F}irst order local \textbf{I}nfluence, which is rooted in information geometry and quantifies the sensitivity of individual parameter and input dimensions. Our extensive analysis across LLMs and VLMs (from 1.5B to 13B parameters) reveals that: (I) A small subset of parameters or input dimensions with high FI values disproportionately contribute to model brittleness. (II) Mitigating the influence of these vulnerable parameters during model merging leads to improved performance.</description>

      <title>Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader Approaches Best-of-Both-Worlds for the m-Set Semi-Bandit Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a common case of the combinatorial semi-bandit problem, the $m$-set semi-bandit, where the learner exactly selects $m$ arms from the total $d$ arms. In the adversarial setting, the best regret bound, known to be $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd})$ for time horizon $n$, is achieved by the well-known Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policy. However, this requires to explicitly compute the arm-selection probabilities via optimizing problems at each time step and sample according to them. This problem can be avoided by the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy, which simply pulls the $m$ arms that rank among the $m$ smallest (estimated) loss with random perturbation. In this paper, we show that FTPL with a Fr\'echet perturbation also enjoys the near optimal regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nm}(\sqrt{d\log(d)}+m^{5/6}))$ in the adversarial setting and approaches best-of-both-world regret bounds, i.e., achieves a logarithmic regret for the stochastic setting. Moreover, our lower bounds show that the extra factors are unavoidable with our approach; any improvement would require a fundamentally different and more challenging method.</description>

      <title>On the retraining frequency of global forecasting models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era of increasing computational capabilities and growing environmental consciousness, organizations face a critical challenge in balancing the accuracy of forecasting models with computational efficiency and sustainability. Global forecasting models, lowering the computational time, have gained significant attention over the years. However, the common practice of retraining these models with new observations raises important questions about the costs of forecasting. Using ten different machine learning and deep learning models, we analyzed various retraining scenarios, ranging from continuous updates to no retraining at all, across two large retail datasets. We showed that less frequent retraining strategies maintain the forecast accuracy while reducing the computational costs, providing a more sustainable approach to large-scale forecasting. We also found that machine learning models are a marginally better choice to reduce the costs of forecasting when coupled with less frequent model retraining strategies as the frequency of the data increases. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that frequent retraining is essential for maintaining forecasting accuracy. Instead, periodic retraining offers a good balance between predictive performance and efficiency, both in the case of point and probabilistic forecasting. These insights provide actionable guidelines for organizations seeking to optimize forecasting pipelines while reducing costs and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Learning in Finance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results for financial prediction using large, over-parameterized models. This paper provides theoretical foundations and empirical validation for understanding when and how these methods achieve predictive success. I examine two key aspects of high-dimensional learning in finance. First, I prove that within-sample standardization in Random Fourier Features implementations fundamentally alters the underlying Gaussian kernel approximation, replacing shift-invariant kernels with training-set dependent alternatives. Second, I establish information-theoretic lower bounds that identify when reliable learning is impossible no matter how sophisticated the estimator. A detailed quantitative calibration of the polynomial lower bound shows that with typical parameter choices, e.g., 12,000 features, 12 monthly observations, and R-square 2-3%, the required sample size to escape the bound exceeds 25-30 years of data--well beyond any rolling-window actually used. Thus, observed out-of-sample success must originate from lower-complexity artefacts rather than from the intended high-dimensional mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Geometries of Truth Are Orthogonal Across Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and, when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when examined across tasks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multiobject Tracking With Neural-Enhanced Motion and Measurement Models</title>

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so, the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved. To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance</description>

      <title>Minimax and Bayes Optimal Best-arm Identification: Adaptive Experimental Design for Treatment Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates adaptive experimental design for treatment choice, also known as fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a treatment-allocation phase followed by a treatment-choice phase, and we design an adaptive experiment for this setup to efficiently identify the best treatment arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our designed experiment, the treatment-allocation phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, where we allocate each treatment arm uniformly with equal proportions to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, we allocate treatment arms in proportion to the variances estimated in the first stage. After the treatment-allocation phase, the procedure enters the treatment-choice phase, where we choose the treatment arm with the highest sample mean as our estimate of the best treatment arm. We prove that this single design is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, with upper bounds that match our lower bounds up to exact constants. Therefore, our designed experiment achieves the sharp efficiency limits without requiring separate tuning for minimax and Bayesian objectives.</description>
