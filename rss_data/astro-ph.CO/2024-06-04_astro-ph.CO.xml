      <title>Baryonification extended to thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonification algorithms model the impact of galaxy formation and feedback on the matter field in gravity-only simulations by adopting physically motivated parametric prescriptions. In this paper, we extend these models to describe gas temperature and pressure, allowing for a self-consistent modelling of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, weak gravitational lensing, and their cross-correlation, down to small scales. We validate our approach by showing that it can simultaneously reproduce the electron pressure, gas, stellar, and dark matter power spectra as measured in all BAHAMAS hydrodynamical simulations. Specifically, with only two additional free parameters, we can fit the electron pressure auto- and cross-power spectra at 10% while reproducing the suppression in the matter power spectrum induced by baryons at the per cent level, for different AGN feedback strengths in BAHAMAS. Furthermore, we reproduce BAHAMAS convergence and thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich angular power spectra within 1% and 10% accuracy, respectively, down to l = 5000. When used jointly with cosmological rescaling algorithms, the baryonification presented here will allow a fast and accurate exploration of cosmological and astrophysical scenarios. Therefore, it can be employed to create mock catalogues, lightcones, and large training sets for emulators aimed at interpreting forthcoming multi-wavelength observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Galaxy clusters as probes of cosmic isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling relations of galaxy clusters are a powerful probe of cosmic isotropy in the late Universe. Owing to their strong cosmological dependence, galaxy cluster scaling relations can obtain tight constraints on the spatial variation of cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant ($H_0$), and detect large-scale bulk flow motions. Such tests are crucial to scrutinise the validity of $\Lambda$CDM in the local Universe and determine at what cosmic scales (if any) extra-galactic objects converge to isotropy within the Cosmic Microwave Background rest frame. This review describes the methodology for conducting cosmic isotropy tests with cluster scaling relations and examines possible systematic biases. We also discuss the results of past studies that reported statistically significant observed anisotropies in the local Universe. Finally, we explore the future potential of cluster scaling relations as a cosmic isotropy probe given the large amount of multi-wavelength cluster data expected in the near future.</description>

      <title>The clustering of Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies at z=2-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the clustering of Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) selected from the One-hundred-square-degree DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, with spectroscopic follow-up from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We use DESI spectroscopy to optimize our selection and to constrain the interloper fraction and redshift distribution of our narrow-band selected sources. We select samples at z=2.45 and 3.1 in the COSMOS field with median Ly-alpha fluxes of 10^{-16}erg/s/cm2. Covariances and cosmological inferences are obtained from a series of mock catalogs built upon high-resolution N-body simulations that match the footprint, number density, redshift distribution and observed clustering of the sample. We find that both samples have a correlation length of r_0=3.0+/-0.2 Mpc/h. Within our fiducial cosmology these correspond to 3D number densities of 10^{-3}h3/Mpc3 and, from our mock catalogs, biases of 1.7 and 2.0 at z=2.45 and 3.1, respectively. We discuss the implications of these measurements for the use of LAEs as large-scale structure tracers for high-redshift cosmology.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to the cosmic dipole in radio galaxy surveys: Joint analysis of NVSS &amp; RACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the sky distribution of radio galaxies in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS). Analyses of these samples have reported tension between their inferred dipoles and the kinematic dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This represents a challenge to the traditional assumption that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales: the cosmological principle. We find that NVSS and RACS contain local radio sources which give a non-negligible contribution to the overall dipole signal. These need to be adequately accounted for since the aim is to probe the composition of the Universe at large scales. By appropriately considering these sources, the inferred dipole amplitude in either sample is reduced. Nonetheless, we find support for a dipole aligning with that of the CMB but larger in amplitude, especially in the joint analysis. However, the 'clustering dipole' - the contribution of local sources to the net inferred dipole - appears to align with the direction of the CMB dipole, and its magnitude increases as deeper nearby sources are considered up to a comoving distance of $\approx 130$ Mpc ($h=0.7$). The significance of this observation in the context of the cosmological principle is unclear and prompts further inquiry.</description>

      <title>Uncorrelated estimations of $H_0$ redshift evolution from DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrumnet (DESI) collaboration recently released the first year data of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Basing on the five different tracers, the cosmological constraint shows a hint of deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this letter, We combine the DESI BAOs with other cosmic probes to constrain the evolution of Hubble constant as a function of redshift in flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The non-parametric method is used to estimate the value of Hubble constant at different redshift bins. The correlation among different bins are removed by diagonalizing the covariance matrix. The joint data sample demonstrate a decreasing trend of Hubble constant with a significance of $8.6 \sigma$, which can naturally resolve the Hubble tension. It may be due to dynamical dark energy or modified gravity.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Colour standardisation of Type Ia Supernovae and its dependence on environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Type Ia supernova cosmology transitions from a statistics dominated to a systematics dominated era, it is crucial to understand leftover unexplained uncertainties affecting their luminosity, such as the ones stemming from astrophysical biases. Indeed, SNe Ia are standardisable candles, whose absolute magnitude reach a 0.15~mag scatter once empirical correlations with their lightcurve stretch and colour and with their environment are accounted for. In this paper, we investigate how the standardisation process of SNe Ia depends on environment, to ultimately reduce their scatter in magnitude, focusing on colour standardisation. We use the volume-limited ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample, which offers unprecedented statistics for the low redshift ($z&lt;0.06$) range. We first study the colour distribution, focusing on the effects of dust, to then select a dustless subsample of objects from low stellar mass environments and from the outskirts of their host galaxies. We then look at the colour-residuals relation and its associated parameter $\beta$. Finally, we investigate the colour dependency of the environment-dependent magnitude offsets (steps), to try to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic colour origin. Our sample probes well the red tail of the colour distribution, up to $c=0.8$. The dustless sample exhibits a significantly lower red tail ($4.6\sigma$) in comparison to the whole sample. This suggests that reddening above $c\geq0.2$ is dominated by host interstellar dust absorption. Looking at the colour-residuals relation, we find it to be linear with lightcurve colour. We show hints of a potential evolution of $\beta$ with host stellar mass at a $2.5\sigma$ level. Finally, unlike recent claims from the literature, we see no evolution of steps as a function of lightcurve colour, suggesting that dust may not be the dominating mechanism responsible for the environmental dependency of SNe Ia magnitude.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Study of Type Ia Supernova lightcurve fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology relies on the estimation of lightcurve parameters to derive precision distances that leads to the estimation of cosmological parameters. The empirical SALT2 lightcurve modeling that relies on only two parameters, a stretch x1, and a color c, has been used by the community for almost two decades. In this paper we study the ability of the SALT2 model to fit the nearly 3000 cosmology-grade SN Ia lightcurves from the second release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) cosmology science working group. While the ZTF data was not used to train SALT2, the algorithm is modeling the ZTF SN Ia optical lightcurves remarkably well, except for lightcurve points prior to -10 d from maximum, where the training critically lacks statistics. We find that the lightcurve fitting is robust against the considered choice of phase-range, but we show the [-10; +40] d range to be optimal in terms of statistics and accuracy. We do not detect any significant features in the lightcurve fit residuals that could be connected to the host environment. Potential systematic population differences related to the SN Ia host properties might thus not be accountable for by the addition of extra lightcurve parameters. However, a small but significant inconsistency between residuals of blue- and red-SN Ia strongly suggests the existence of a phase-dependent color term, with potential implications for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We thus encourage modellers to explore this avenue and we emphasize the importance that SN Ia cosmology must include a SALT2 retraining to accurately model the lightcurves and avoid biasing the derivation of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistical Effects on Warm Dark Matter and the Mass Constraint from the Cosmic Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suppression of small-scale matter power spectrum is a distinct feature of Warm Dark Matter (WDM), which permits a constraint on the WDM mass from galaxy surveys. In the thermal relic WDM scenario, quantum statistical effects are not manifest. In a unified framework, we investigate the quantum statistical effects for a fermion case with a degenerate pressure and a boson case with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Compared to the thermal relic case, the degenerate fermion case only slightly lowers the mass bound while the boson case with a high initial BEC fraction ($\gtrsim90\%$) significantly lowers it. On the other hand, the BEC fraction drops during the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition and completely disappears if the initial fraction is below $\sim64\%$. Given the rising interest in resolving the late-time galaxy-scale problems with boson condensation, a question is posed on how a high initial BEC fraction can be dynamically created so that a DM condensed component remains today.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational wave backgrounds from phase transitions with next generation ground based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will operate in the $(\text{few}-10^4)$ Hz frequency band, with a boost in sensitivity providing an unprecedented reach into primordial cosmology. Working concurrently with pulsar timing arrays in the nHz band, and LISA in the mHz band, these 3G detectors will be powerful probes of beyond the standard model particle physics on scales $T\gtrsim 10^{7}$GeV. Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early universe. We first overview the landscape of detectors across frequencies, discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss their spectrum and summarise the expected constraints on these models from 3G detectors, together with SKA and LISA.</description>

      <title>21cmSense v2: A modular, open-source 21cm sensitivity calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21cm line of neutral hydrogen is a powerful probe of the high-redshift universe (Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization), with an unprecedented potential to inform us about key processes of early galaxy formation, the first stars and even cosmology and structure formation, via intensity mapping. It is the subject of a number of current and upcoming low-frequency radio experiments. This paper presents 21cmSense v2.0, which is a Python package that provides a modular framework for calculating the sensitivity of these experiments, in order to enhance the process of their design and forecasting their power for parameter inference. Version 2.0 of 21cmSense has been re-written from the ground up to be more modular and extensible than its venerable predecessor (Pober et al., 2013, 2014), and to provide a more user-friendly interface. The package is freely available both to use and contribute towards at https://github.com/rasg-affiliates/21cmSense.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian tails without stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, both analytically and numerically, that non-Gaussian tails in the probability density function of curvature perturbations arise in ultra-slow-roll inflation from the $\delta N$ formalism, without invoking stochastic inflation. Previously reported discrepancies between both approaches are a consequence of not correctly accounting for momentum perturbations. Once they are taken into account, both approaches agree to an excellent degree. The shape of the tail depends strongly on the phase space of inflation.</description>

      <title>Towards an optimal marked correlation function analysis for the detection of modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified gravity (MG) theories have emerged as a promising alternative to explain the late-time acceleration of the Universe. However, the detection of MG in observations of the large-scale structure remains challenging due to the screening mechanisms that obscure any deviations from General Relativity (GR) in high-density regions. The marked two-point correlation function offers a promising approach to potentially detect MG signals. This work investigates novel marks based on large-scale environment estimates but also that exploit the anti-correlation between objects in low- and high-density regions. This is the first time discreteness effects in density-dependent marked correlation functions are investigated in depth. We assess the performance of various marks to distinguish GR from MG by using the ELEPHANT simulations, comprised of realisations of GR as well as $f(R)$ and nDGP gravity. In addition, discreteness effects are studied using the high-density Covmos catalogues. We establish a robust method to correct for shot-noise effects that allows the recovery of the true signal with an accuracy below $5\%$ over a wide range of scales. We find such correction to be crucial to measure the amplitude of the marked correlation function in an unbiased manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that marks, anti-correlating objects in low- and high-density regions, are among the most effective in distinguishing between MG and GR. We report differences in the marked correlation function between $f(R)$ with $|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$ and GR simulations of the order of 3-5$\sigma$ in real space up to scales of about $80\, h^{-1} \, {\rm Mpc}$. The redshift-space monopole exhibits similar features and performances. The combination of the proposed $\tanh$-mark with shot-noise correction paves the way towards an optimal approach for the detection of MG in current and future galaxy spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Hybrid inflation and gravitational waves from accidentally light scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a hybrid-inflation model where the inflaton potential is generated radiatively, as gauge symmetries guarantee it to be accidentally flat at tree level. The model can be regarded as a small-field version of Natural Inflation, with inflation ending when the mass of a second scalar, the waterfall field, turns tachyonic. This provides a minimal, robust realisation of hybrid inflation, which predicts specific correlations among CMB observables. Tachyonic preheating leads to the production of gravitational waves which, for a low inflationary scale, might be detected by upcoming experiments. Simple variations of the model can give rise to topological defects, such as unstable domain walls. Their dynamics produces a stochastic gravitational-wave background, which can be compatible with the recent detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

Abstract: We show that if dark matter consists of QCD axions in the post-inflationary scenario more than ten percent of it efficiently collapses into Bose stars at matter-radiation equality. Such a result is mostly independent of the present uncertainties on the axion mass. This large population of solitons, with asteroid masses and Earth-Moon distance sizes, might plausibly survive until today, with potentially interesting implications for phenomenology and experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy millicharged particles from the atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If millicharged particles (MCPs) exist they can be created in the atmosphere when high energy cosmic rays collide with nuclei and could subsequently be detected at neutrino experiments. We extend previous work, which considered MCPs from decays of light mesons and proton bremsstrahlung, by including production from $\Upsilon$ meson decays and the Drell-Yan process. MCPs with masses below a GeV primarily arise from proton bremsstrahlung, while heavier MCPs predominantly originate from heavy meson decays and Drell-Yan. We analyse the resulting single scatter and multiple scatter signals at SuperK and JUNO. Searches for low energy coincident signals at JUNO will be sensitive to MCPs with milli-charges up to an order of magnitude beyond current constraints for MCP masses between 2 GeV and 10 GeV.</description>

      <title>New insights into axion freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freeze-in via the axion-photon coupling, $g_{\phi\gamma}$, can produce axions in the early Universe. At low reheating temperatures close to the minimum allowed value $T_{\rm reh}\approx T_{\rm BBN}\approx 10\,{\rm MeV}$, the abundance peaks for axion masses $m_\phi\approx T_{\rm reh}$. Such heavy axions are unstable and subsequently decay, leading to strong constraints on $g_{\phi\gamma}$ from astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we revisit the computation of the freeze-in abundance and clarify important issues. We begin with a complete computation of the collision terms for the Primakoff process, electron-positron annihilation, and photon-to-axion (inverse-)decay, while approximately taking into account plasma screening and threshold effects. We then solve the Boltzmann equation for the full axion distribution function. We confirm previous results about the importance of both processes to the effective "relic abundance" (defined as density prior to decay), and provide useful fitting formulae to estimate the freeze-in abundance from the equilibrium interaction rate. For the distribution function, we find an out-of-equilibrium population of axions and introduce an effective temperature for them. We follow the evolution right up until decay, and find that the average axion kinetic energy is larger than a thermal relic by between 20\% and 80\%, which may have implications for limits on decaying axions from X-ray spectra. We extend our study to a two-axion system with quartic cross-coupling, and find that for typical/expected couplings, freeze-in of a second axion flavour by annihilations leads to a negligibly small contribution to the relic density.</description>

      <title>Effects of Neutrino-Ultralight Dark Matter Interaction on the Cosmic Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter interacting with sterile neutrinos would modify the evolution and properties of the cosmic neutrino background through active-sterile neutrino mixing. We investigate how such an interaction would induce a redshift dependence in neutrino masses. We highlight that cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses would require reinterpretation due to the effective mass generated by neutrino-dark matter interactions. Furthermore, we present an example where such interactions can alter the mass ordering of neutrinos in the early Universe, compared to what we expect today. We also address the expected changes in the event rates in a PTOLEMY-like experiment, which aims to detect the cosmic neutrino background via neutrino capture, and discuss projected constraints.</description>

      <title>Constrained cosmological simulations of the Local Group using Bayesian hierarchical field-level inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach based on Bayesian field-level inference capable of resolving individual galaxies within the Local Group (LG), enabling detailed studies of its structure and formation via posterior simulations. We extend the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm with a multi-resolution approach, allowing us to reach smaller mass scales and apply observational constraints based on LG galaxies. Our updated data model simultaneously accounts for observations of mass tracers within the dark haloes of the Milky Way (MW) and M31, their observed separation and relative velocity, and the quiet surrounding Hubble flow represented through the positions and velocities of galaxies at distances from one to four Mpc. Our approach delivers representative posterior samples of $\Lambda$CDM realisations that are statistically and simultaneously consistent with all these observations, leading to significantly tighter mass constraints than found if the individual datasets are considered separately. In particular, we estimate the virial masses of the MW and M31 to be $\log_{10}(M_{200c}/M_\odot) = 12.07\pm0.08$ and $12.33\pm0.10$, respectively, their sum to be $\log_{10}(\Sigma M_{200c}/M_\odot)= 12.52\pm0.07$, and the enclosed mass within spheres of radius $R$ to be $\log_{10}(M(R)/M_\odot)= 12.71\pm0.06$ and $12.96\pm0.08$ for $R=1$ Mpc and 3 Mpc, respectively. The M31-MW orbit is nearly radial for most of our $\Lambda$CDM LG's, and most lie in a dark matter sheet that aligns approximately with the Supergalactic Plane, even though the surrounding density field was not used explicitly as a constraint. The approximate simulations employed in our inference are accurately reproduced by high-fidelity structure formation simulations, demonstrating the potential for future high-resolution, full-physics $\Lambda$CDM posterior simulations of LG look-alikes.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. By employing a methodology to stack tracking data in combination with Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain parameter recovery tests, we show that the mission will be sensitive to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-1}$ Hz, provided that tracking data is taken consistently over a large fraction of the cruise duration. Thus, the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. Within this assumption, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(1 - 100)$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons that kinetically mix with the Standard Model photon give rise to new spectral anisotropies (patchy dark screening) in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) due to conversion of photons to dark photons within large-scale structure. We utilize predictions for this patchy dark screening signal to provide the tightest constraints to date on the dark photon kinetic mixing parameter ($\varepsilon \lesssim 4\times 10^{-8}$ (95\% confidence level)) over the mass range $10^{-13} \,\, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_{{A^\prime}} \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, almost an order of magnitude stronger than previous limits, by applying state-of-the-art component separation techniques to the cross-correlation of $\textit{Planck}$ CMB and $\textit{unWISE}$ galaxy survey data.</description>

      <title>Forecast Cosmological Constraints with the 1D Wavelet Scattering Transform and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make forecasts for the constraining power of the 1D Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) when used with a Lyman-$\alpha$ forest cosmology survey. Using mock simulations and a Fisher matrix, we show that there is considerable cosmological information in the scattering transform coefficients not captured by the flux power spectrum. We estimate mock covariance matrices assuming uncorrelated Gaussian pixel noise for each quasar, at a level drawn from a simple lognormal model. The extra information comes from a smaller estimated covariance in the first-order wavelet power, and from second-order wavelet coefficients which probe non-Gaussian information in the forest. Forecast constraints on cosmological parameters from the WST are more than an order of magnitude tighter than for the power spectrum, shrinking a $4D$ parameter space by a factor of $10^6$. Should these improvements be realised with DESI, inflationary running would be constrained to test common inflationary models predicting $\alpha_s = - 6\times 10^{-4}$ and neutrino mass constraints would be improved enough for a $5-\sigma$ detection of the minimal neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Improving the Cosmological Constraints by Inferring the Formation Channel of Extreme-mass-ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could be detected by space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), TianQin and Taiji. Localizing EMRIs by GW detectors can help us select candidate host galaxies, which can be used to infer the cosmic expansion history. In this paper, we demonstrate that the localization information can also be used to infer the formation channel of EMRIs, and hence allow us to extract more precisely the redshift probability distributions. By conducting mock observations of the EMRIs which can be detected by TianQin and LISA, as well as the galaxies which can be provided by the future Chinese Space Station Telescope, we find that TianQin can constrain the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ to a precision of $\sim3\%-8\%$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ to $\sim10\%-40\%$. The TianQin+LISA network, by increasing the localization accuracy, can improve the precisions of $H_0$ and $w_0$ to $\sim0.4\%-7\%$ and $\sim4\%-20\%$, respectively. Then, considering an illustrative case in which all EMRIs originate in AGNs, and combining the mock EMRI observation with a mock AGN catalog, we show that TianQin can recognize the EMRI-AGN correlation with $\sim 1300$ detections. The TianQin+LISA network can reduce this required number to $\sim 30$. Additionally, we propose a statistical method to directly estimate the fraction of EMRIs produced in AGNs, $f_{\rm agn}$, and show that observationally deriving this value could significantly improve the constraints on the cosmological parameters. These results demonstrate the potentials of using EMRIs as well as galaxy and AGN surveys to improve the constraints on cosmological parameters and the formation channel of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and XCDM cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w&lt;-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w&gt;-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L&gt;1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $&gt; 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).</description>

      <title>MEET-U Project I: The key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both DES5YR SNe and DESI BAO contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is largely understood to be homogeneous and isotropic, the CMB power presents anomalies that seem to break down parity symmetry at large angular scales. We argue that the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra can be parity asymmetric by considering the existence of two distinct power spectra in the two parity conjugate regions of the CMB sky without introducing any additional parameters. We impose a superselection rule to the vacuum structure for (single field) inflationary quantum fluctuations based on discrete spacetime transformations ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$). As a result, we estimate the amplitude of power asymmetry in the scalar and tensor sectors at different scales of $ 10^{-4} {\rm Mpc^{-1}}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. In particular, we predict the parity asymmetry for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) and quantify it for different models, like Starobinsky and $\alpha-$attractors single-field inflation.</description>

      <title>From QFT to Boltzmann: Freeze-in in the presence of oscillating condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar dark matter (DM), and axions in particular, have an irreducible abundance of particles produced by freeze-in due to portal interactions with the Standard Model plasma in the early Universe. In addition, vacuum misalignment and other mechanisms can lead to the presence of a cold, oscillating condensate. Therefore, generically, the evolution of the DM in both forms, condensate and particles, needs to be studied simultaneously. In non-equilibrium quantum field theory, the condensate and particles are described by one- and two-point functions, respectively. The fundamental coupled equations of motion (EoMs) of these objects are non-local. To simplify the EoMs and bring them into a familiar form for relic abundance calculations, we perform a Markovianization process for a quasi-harmonically oscillating homogeneous condensate, leading to local EoMs for the particle distribution function and the envelope function of condensate oscillation. This reduces the dynamics to a pair of coupled Boltzmann equations, and we derive explicitly the form of the collision operators for all particle and condensate interactions.</description>

      <title>Dark matter distribution in Milky Way-analog galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding of how dark matter (DM) is distributed within the Milky Way halo, particularly in the solar neighborhood, is based on either careful studies of the local stellar orbits, model assumptions on the global shape of the MW halo, or from direct acceleration measurements. In this work, we undertake a study of external galaxies, with the intent of providing insight to the DM distribution in MW-analog galaxies. For this, we carefully select a sample of galaxies similar to the MW, based on maximum atomic hydrogen (HI) rotational velocity ($v_{\rm max,HI}$= 200-280 km s$^{-1}$) and morphological type (Sab-Sbc) criteria. With a need for deep, highly-resolved HI, our resulting sample is composed of 5 galaxies from the VIVA and THINGS surveys. To perform our baryonic analysis, we use deep Spitzer mid-IR images at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m from the S$^4$G survey. Based on the dynamical three-dimensional modeling software $^{3D}$Barolo, we construct rotation curves (RCs) and derive the gas and stellar contributions from the galaxy's gaseous- and stellar-disks mass surface density profiles. Through a careful decomposition of their RCs into their baryonic (stars, gas) and DM components, we isolate the DM contribution by using an MCMC-based approach. Based on the Sun's location and the MW's R$_{25}$, we define the corresponding location of the solar neighborhood in these systems. We put forward a window for the DM density ($\rho_{dm}$ = 0.21-0.55 GeV cm$^{-3}$) at these galactocentric distances in our MW analog sample, consistent with the values found for the MW's local DM density, based on more traditional approaches found in the literature.</description>

      <title>An Optical Gamma-Ray Burst Catalogue with Measured Redshift PART I: Data Release of 535 Gamma-Ray Bursts and Colour Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the largest optical photometry compilation of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with redshifts ($z$). We include 64813 observations of 535 events (including upper limits) from 28 February 1997 up to 18 August 2023. We also present a user-friendly web tool \textit{grbLC} which allows users the visualization of photometry, coordinates, redshift, host galaxy extinction, and spectral indices for each event in our database. Furthermore, we have added a Gamma Ray Coordinate Network (GCN) scraper that can be used to collect data by gathering magnitudes from the GCNs. The web tool also includes a package for uniformly investigating colour evolution. We compute the optical spectral indices for 138 GRBs for which we have at least 4 filters at the same epoch in our sample and craft a procedure to distinguish between GRBs with and without colour evolution. By providing a uniform format and repository for the optical catalogue, this web-based archive is the first step towards unifying several community efforts to gather the photometric information for all GRBs with known redshifts. This catalogue will enable population studies by providing light curves (LCs) with better coverage since we have gathered data from different ground-based locations. Consequently, these LCs can be used to train future LC reconstructions for an extended inference of the redshift. The data gathering also allows us to fill some of the orbital gaps from Swift in crucial points of the LCs, e.g., at the end of the plateau emission or where a jet break is identified.</description>

      <title>The discovery and significance of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2007 we were part of a team that discovered the so-called ``Lorimer Burst'', the first example of a new class of objects now known as fast radio bursts (FRBs). These enigmatic events are only a few ms in duration and occur at random locations on the sky at a rate of a few thousand per day. Several thousand FRBs are currently known. While it is now well established that they have a cosmological origin, and about 10\% of all currently known sources have been seen to exhibit multiple bursts, the origins of these enigmatic sources are currently poorly understood. In this article, we review the discovery of FRBs and present some of the highlights from the vast body of work by an international community. Following a brief overview of the scale of the visible Universe in \S 1, we describe the key moments in radio astronomy (\S 2) that led up to the discovery of the Lorimer burst (\S 3). Early efforts to find more FRBs are described in \S 4 which led to the discovery of the first repeating source (\S 5). In \S 6, as we close out on the second decade of FRBs, we outline some of the many open questions in the field and look ahead to the coming years where many surprises are surely in store.</description>
