      <title>Twenty-Year Review of Outdoor Air Quality in Utah, USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air quality is a prevalent concern due to its imposing health risks. The state of Utah, USA, has, at times over the last 20 years, experienced some of the worst air quality in the nation. The propensity for Utah to experience elevated concentrations of particulate matter ($\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$) and ozone ($\mathrm{O_3}$) can, in part, be attributed to its unique geography, which features dry, mountainous terrain. Valleys in Utah create ideal environments for extended cold-pool events. In this review, we summarize air quality research conducted in Utah over the past 20 years (2002-2022) by dividing the state into six regions: Utah Valley, Summit County, Southern Utah (regions south of Utah Valley), Cache Valley, Uinta Basin, and Salt Lake Valley. We review the published literature chronologically and provide a summary for each region, identifying areas where additional research is warranted. We found that research efforts are heavily weighted toward the Uinta Basin and Salt Lake Valley, with the remaining regions collectively accounting for only 20% of studies. We identified the need for more source apportionment studies, speciated volatile organic compound (VOC) analyses, and ozone isopleths. Where ozone isopleths cannot be created, measurements of glyoxal ($\mathrm{CHOCHO}$) and formaldehyde ($\mathrm{HCHO}$) concentrations could serve as cost-effective surrogates to inform ozone mitigation policies.</description>

      <title>Friday the 13th Hailstorm in the province of Bulacan, Philippines (13 August 2021): A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This case study presents a thorough investigation of the environmental setup that led to the hail-producing severe storm that impacted the municipality of Norzagaray and City of San Jose Del Monte, including other nearby areas, in the province of Bulacan on the afternoon of August 13, 2021. During this period, 2-5 cm and potentially as large as $\sim$8 cm diameter hail was reported over these locations of Bulacan. For this purpose, the combination of HIMAWARI-8 AHI, PLDN and its flash counts, and meteorological indices; synoptic, thermodynamic, and kinematic indices, calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis are utilized to understand the nature of the hail event. In the morning, the pre-convective environment was comprised by a warm inversion layer that inhibited storm initiation, until the arrival of ample moisture and convective heating in the afternoon. By the afternoon, model sounding analysis revealed that the environment transitioned into uncapped profile with steep low-level lapse rate owing to warm, moist south-westerly wind flow from the Manila Bay in the lower troposphere and north-easterlies aloft crossing the SMMR induced by a weak low-pressure system located in the eastern Philippine Sea, with minimal turning on the wind profile. This promoted low-level convergence within the area of interest and build up of instability. The updraft associated with convectively unstable atmosphere, sufficient cloud-layer bulk shear, and storm nudging at its maturing phase countered entrainment-driven dilution and aided the growth of ice crystals by rapid collection of supercooled cloud liquid particles, which ultimately led to formation of hailstones.</description>

      <title>Predicting Coastal Water Levels in the Context of Climate Change Using Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Time Series Analysis Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given recent increases in ocean water levels brought on by climate change, this investigation decomposed changes in coastal water levels into its fundamental components to predict maximum water levels for a given coastal location. The study focused on Virginia Key, Florida, in the United States, located near the coast of Miami. Hourly mean lower low water (MLLW) levels were obtained from the National Data Buoy Center from January 28, 1994, through December 31, 2023. In the temporal dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filters were used to extract long-term trends, annual and daily tides, and higher frequency harmonics, while in the spectral dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing were used to confirm known tidal frequencies and periods. A linear model predicted that the long-term trend in water level will rise 2.02 feet from January 1994 to December 2050, while a quadratic model predicted a rise of 5.91 during the same period. In addition, the combined crests of annual tides, daily tides, and higher frequency harmonics increase water levels up to 2.16 feet, yielding a combined total of 4.18 feet as a lower bound and a combined total of 8.09 feet as an upper bound. These findings provide a foundation for more accurate prediction of coastal flooding during severe weather events and provide an impetus for policy choices with respect to residential communities, businesses, and wildlife habitats. Further, using Kolmogorov-Zurbenko analytic methods to study coastal sites throughout the world could draw a more comprehensive picture of the impact climate change is having on coastal waters globally.</description>

      <title>The Controlled Four-Parameter Method for Cross-Assignment of Directional Wave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-assignment of directional wave spectra is a critical task in wave data assimilation. Traditionally, most methods rely on two-parameter spectral distances or energy ranking approaches, which often fail to account for the complexities of the wave field, leading to inaccuracies. To address these limitations, we propose the Controlled Four-Parameter Method (C4PM), which independently considers four integrated wave parameters. This method enhances the accuracy and robustness of cross-assignment by offering flexibility in assigning weights and controls to each wave parameter. We compare C4PM with a two-parameter spectral distance method using data from two buoys moored 13 km apart in deep water. Although both methods produce negligible bias and high correlation, C4PM demonstrates superior performance by preventing the occurrence of outliers and achieving a lower root mean square error across all parameters. The negligible computational cost and customization make C4PM a valuable tool for wave data assimilation, improving the reliability of forecasts and model validations.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and statistical correction of area-based heat index forecasts that drive a heatwave warning service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of the area-based, district heatwave forecasts that drive the Australian heatwave warning service. The analysis involves using a recently developed approach of scoring multicategorical forecasts using the FIxed Risk Multicategorical (FIRM) scoring framework. Additionally, we quantify the stability of the district forecasts between forecast updates. Notably, at longer lead times, a discernible overforecast bias exists that leads to issuing severe and extreme heatwave district forecasts too frequently. Consequently, at shorter lead times forecast heatwave categories are frequently downgraded with subsequent revisions. To address these issues, we demonstrate how isotonic regression can be used to conditionally bias correct the district forecasts. Finally, using synthetic experiments, we illustrate that even if an area warning is derived from a perfectly calibrated gridded forecast, the area warning will be biased in most situations. We show how these biases can also be corrected using isotonic regression which could lead to a better warning service. Importantly, the evaluation and bias correction approaches demonstrated in this paper are relevant to forecast parameters other than heat indices.</description>
