      <title>Axion Quality Problem: Keep Calm and Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion models generically suffer from a severe quality problem when coupled to gravity. In this article we provide a very simple model with a high quality axion. The axion is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the baryon number symmetry, $U(1)_B$, of a new composite sector that breaks $U(1)_B$ spontaneously when it confines. A controlled example is a supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with $N_c = N_f$. The axion shift symmetry is automatically protected due to the high dimension of the gauge-invariant baryon operator, with the Peccei-Quinn breaking operators arising at dimension $N_c+2$. The standard model gauge group is embedded as a subgroup of the flavor symmetry group of SQCD that has an anomaly with $U(1)_B$, generating the standard coupling with gluons.</description>

      <title>Axion Perturbations: A General Analytical Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological data provides us two key constraints on dark matter (DM): it must have a particular abundance, and it must have an adiabatic spectrum of density perturbations in the early universe. Many different cosmological scenarios have been proposed that establish the abundance of axion DM in qualitatively different ways. In this paper we emphasize that, despite this variety of backgrounds, the perturbations in axion DM can be understood from universal principles. How does a feebly interacting axion field acquire perturbations proportional to those of photons? How do the isocurvature power spectrum and non-Gaussianity depend on the background evolution of the universe? We answer these questions for a completely general choice of cosmological background and temperature-dependent axion potential. We show that the most general solution to the axion field equation on super-horizon scales is entirely determined by the family of background solutions for different initial field values $\theta_{\rm ini}$. This holds for both the component in the field perturbation solution contributing to the DM isocurvature perturbation (enhanced at late times by the sensitivity of the DM abundance to the initial condition, $\partial \Omega_a / \partial \theta_{\rm ini}$, which can be large for initial conditions near the hilltop), and the other component that contributes to the DM curvature perturbation. In particular, we explain that an unperturbed axion field in the early universe evolving into one with nontrivial adiabatic perturbations is guaranteed by Weinberg's theorem on adiabatic modes. These results have been derived before with various assumptions, such as a radiation dominated background or a quadratic potential. Our aim is to give a clear, simple derivation that is manifestly independent of those assumptions, and thus can be applied to any cosmological axion scenario.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Interactions with Stellar Motion near Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars orbiting Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center provide a unique laboratory to test gravity and dark matter (DM). We demonstrate that DM interactions in stellar interiors induce a novel momentum transfer force, altering orbits beyond gravitational effects. Using S2's 2000-2019 orbital data we derive the first astrophysical constraints on DM-nucleon scattering, excluding new sub-GeV parameter space. Stellar lifetime constraints over Myr timescales complement these, surpassing some direct detection and cosmological limits. This establishes stellar dynamics as a novel probe of DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Slepton pair production at next-to-leading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near threshold, cross sections for the production of heavy particles are sensitive to large logarithmic terms, which must be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory. Current state-of-the art calculations for inclusive slepton pair production at hadron colliders has focused on higher-order logarithms in the leading power of the threshold variable. Here, we evaluate the next-to-leading power contribution in the threshold variable to leading logarithmic accuracy. We find that the next-to-leading power contributions can be significant compared to the next-to-leading logarithmic terms at leading power, and that existing calculations underestimate the scale error for large slepton masses. We include results for a potential future FCC-hh machine at $\sqrt{s}=85$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Sterile neutrino dark matter from a TeV Scale Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the phenomenological aspects of a feebly interacting sterile neutrino dark matter in a low-scale seesaw setup. The Type-I seesaw framework is augmented by a second complex scalar doublet ($\Phi_{\nu}$), which couples exclusively with the heavy right-handed neutrinos and the lepton doublet, thereby forming the neutrino Dirac mass term, while the first doublet is responsible for the mass generation of the remaining Standard Model particles. The lightest sterile neutrino ($N_1$) serves as a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced primarily through W and Z boson decays -a previously overlooked dominant contribution that solely determines the relic abundance. Owing to the small vev ($v_{\nu}\sim 10$ MeV) of the second Higgs doublet, an enhancement in the available parameter space of the sterile neutrino masses is observed, spanning from sub-keV to $0.2$ GeV. After incorporating the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations it is found that the setup is able to accommodate both warm and cold dark matter options.</description>

      <title>Charged scalar bosons under rotation and acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in the rigidly rotating frame is studied in presence of the external static electromagnetic fields, being formed either in the resting, or in the general rotating or in the local-flat frames. It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that $\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$ is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G&lt;0$ the charged spinless-boson vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for neutrino interaction model parameter tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy physics experiments studying neutrinos rely heavily on simulations of their interactions with atomic nuclei. Limitations in the theoretical understanding of these interactions typically necessitate ad hoc tuning of simulation model parameters to data. Traditional tuning methods for neutrino experiments have largely relied on simple algorithms for numerical optimization. While adequate for the modest goals of initial efforts, the complexity of future neutrino tuning campaigns is expected to increase substantially, and new approaches will be needed to make progress. In this paper, we examine the application of simulation-based inference (SBI) to the neutrino interaction model tuning for the first time. Using a previous tuning study performed by the MicroBooNE experiment as a test case, we find that our SBI algorithm can correctly infer the tuned parameter values when confronted with a mock data set generated according to the MicroBooNE procedure. This initial proof-of-principle illustrates a promising new technique for next-generation simulation tuning campaigns for the neutrino experimental community.</description>

      <title>Apparent Lorentz violation from disformally coupled ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of general disformal metric transformations on fermions, which shift the gravitational metric by an additional rank-2 tensor. This tensor can in principle be constructed from scalar-field gradients, vector fields, or field-strength contractions. We show this transformation results in the conventional Dirac action being modified by additional kinetic and axial-current couplings that are quadratic in the shifted field. When the field sourcing the metric shift takes on a non-trivial background value, apparent Lorentz-violating effects can result, which we identify as terms in an effective field theory. Assuming the well-motivated cases of scalar and vector ultralight dark matter, we demonstrate that experimental tests of rotation and boost violation imply constraints on the additional kinetic coupling. Even under conservative assumptions, the constraints for vector ultralight dark matter are extremely stringent.</description>

      <title>The rare decays $h^0\rightarrow Z\gamma,V Z$ in the NB-LSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the Higgs rare decays $h^0\rightarrow Z\gamma,V Z$ within the next to minimum B-L supersymmetric model(NB-LSSM), where $V$ represents a vector meson $(\phi,J/\psi,\Upsilon(1S),\rho^0,\omega)$. Compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM), the NB-LSSM introduces three singlet Higgs superfields, which mix with the Higgs doublets and affect the lightest Higgs boson mass and the Higgs couplings. The loop-induced contributions resulting from the effective $h^0Z\gamma$ coupling can produce new physics(NP) contributions, thereby affecting the theoretical predictions of rare decays significantly through the new parameters such as $\kappa$, $\lambda$, $\lambda_2\cdot\cdot\cdot$. The results of this work can provide a reference for probing NP beyond standard model(SM).</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of $\Upsilon$(nS) mean transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correct description of quarkonia production and kinematics are still one of the most challenging assignments for Quantum Chromodynamics. This document presents a study of the $\Upsilon$(1S), (2S) and (3S) mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\Upsilon} \rangle$) as a function of the charged particle multiplicity ($N_{\mathrm{Track}}$) in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV generated with Pythia 8.312 CUETP8M1 tune. The comparison to real data collected by the CMS experiment indicates that the agreement is much better for the excited states than for the ground state. The observed fast increase of the $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\Upsilon} \rangle$ at small values of $N_{\mathrm{Track}}$ is mainly due to the contribution from the away region. Furthermore, when computing the $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\Upsilon} \rangle$ from jetty and isotropic events a clear $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hardening is observed in jetty events. Finally, analyzing the fragmentation of jets containing an $\Upsilon$(nS) it is proposed a method to test the new quarkonia shower present in the Monte Carlo event generator.</description>

      <title>The low-lying light tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{+ }$, $1^{+}$ and $2^{+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-lying light tetraquark states are investigated in the non-relativistic quark model (NRQM) including the pseudoscalar meson exchange, where two different confinement potential schemes, the Cornell potential and the linear potential, are employed, along with the instanton-induced interaction serving as the residual spin-dependent interaction. The numerical results show agreement with masses of $f_{0}(500)$, $f_{0}(1370)$, $f_{0}(1500)$, $f_{0}(2020)$, $f_{0}(2200)$, $h_{1}(1170)$, $h_{1}(1595)$, $h_{1}(1900)$, $h_{1}(1965)$, $h_{1}(2215)$, $f_{2}(1430)$, $f_{2}(1640)$, $f_{2}(1810)$, $f_{2}(2010)$, $f_{2}(2150)$, $a_{0}(980)$, $a_{0}(1450)$, $a_{0}(1950)$, $a_{1}(1260)$, $a_{1}(1640)$, $a_{2}(1700)$, $K^{*}_{0}(1430)$, $K^{*}_{0}(1950)$, $K_{1}(1270)$, $K_{1}(1440)$, $K_{1}(1650)$, and $K^{*}_{2}(1980)$. The results shed light on the spectrum of these mesons and offer guidande to search for the tetraquarks in the future.</description>

      <title>Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry. The broken phase has two massless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes as dynamical fields, and they can be emitted by semilocal strings. In this paper, we numerically show that such NG bosons are copiously produced with the evolution of the semilocal string network in the early universe. Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the role of dark matter. This scenario typically predicts very light pseudo NG boson dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of cosmic fields made from yet unknown light bosons is predicted in many extensions to the Standard Model. They are especially of interest as possible constituents of dark matter. To detect such light and weakly interacting fields, atomic precision measurements offer one of the most sensitive platforms. In this work, we derive which atomic observables are sensitive to what kind of cosmic field couplings. For this we consider fields that couple either through scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, or tensor couplings. We derive the corresponding non relativistic atomic potentials. Based on their symmetry properties, these can induce direct energy shifts or induce atomic electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole as well as nuclear Schiff and anapole moments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement without Spin-Analyzing Power Dependence at the Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement at the colliders which is independent of the spin-analyzing powers. Taking $\Lambda(\to p\pi^-)\bar{\Lambda}(\to \bar{p}\pi^+)$ as an example, we investigate whether quantum entanglement in fermion pairs produced at colliders can be certified by using only angular information from final-state decays, while remaining independent of the parity-violating decay parameters $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$. Building on a general decomposition of any angular observable in terms of Wigner d-functions, we show that the expectation value must take the form $\mathcal{O}_0+\mathcal{O}_1\alpha_\Lambda+\mathcal{O}_2\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}+\mathcal{O}_3\alpha_\Lambda\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$, with coefficients $\mathcal{O}_i$ ($i=0,1,2,3$) linear in the spin-density matrix elements $\alpha_{k,j}\alpha^*_{m,n}$. We obtain the value ranges of observables over the general and separable spaces of $\alpha_{k,j}$, and demonstrate a sufficient entanglement condition for pure states, extending it to mixed states by convexity. In constructing an $\alpha_\Lambda$- and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$-independent witness from angular observables alone, we find that there are obstacles to probe quantum entanglement via the inequality-type and ratio-type ways. Finally, we present the successful constructions with additional spin information: for the process of $e^+e^-\to J/\Psi\to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ at $e^+ e^-$ collider, independent spin information provided by beam-axis selection enables the construction of normalized observables $f_i~(i=1,2)$ that are insensitive to $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$; if their measured values lie in $\left[-1,-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\cup\left(\tfrac{1}{2},1\right]$, entanglement is certified, irrespective of purity or mixedness.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decay in a supersymmetric left-right model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, an important low-energy process, serves not only as a potential test of the Majorana nature of neutrinos, but also as a sensitive probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this study, the supersymmetric left-right model is explored to investigate its impact on $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Although the process takes place at low energies as compared to the electroweak scale, it carries the potential to provide indirect hints about the parity-breaking scale $\text{M}_R$. In this work, we formulate the decay amplitude using an effective field theory approach by separating long- and short-range contributions, each expressed in terms of dimensionless particle physics parameters and nuclear matrix elements. The analysis shows that the $\text{M}_R$ must lie above $1$ TeV, and future experiments may push it beyond $4 - 5$ TeV region. Another important outcome of this work is the role played by the tentative dark matter candidates, the lightest neutralino and sneutrino, which contribute significantly to the half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. This suggests that if any supersymmetric particle is detected in future experiments, dark matter candidates will gain a permanent position in these extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: In these conference proceedings, we discuss recent progress in high-order perturbative studies of the thermodynamic and transport properties of dense quark matter. Special emphasis is placed on the introduction of a promising new computational tool, thermal Loop Tree Duality, which enables pushing the existing weak-coupling calculations to higher perturbative orders.</description>

      <title>Beyond-the-Standard-Model Physics in the Neutrino Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations are a phenomenon that has been observed for over two decades and leads to the conclusion that neutrinos have mass. The Standard Model predicts massless neutrinos, and so neutrinos require physics beyond the Standard Model. Other signatures of BSM physics are detectable in modern neutrino facilities -- this chapter explores those possibilities. These can range from new effects modifying neutrino oscillations (beyond the expectations when neutrinos have mass), to searches for new particles in neutrino facilities. Next-generation experiments are particularly powerful for these searches due to high-intensity neutrino beams and novel detection technologies. We give an introduction to these search strategies, giving a non-comprehensive overview of the field as it stands presently.</description>

      <title>Gluon splitting at small $x$: a unified derivation for the JIMWLK, DGLAP and CSS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to dijet production in electron-ion collisions at small $x$. We focus on the back-to-back configuration where the relative transverse momentum $P_\perp$ of the measured jets is much larger than both their momentum imbalance $K_\perp$ and the target saturation momentum $Q_s(x,A)$. In this regime, we present for the first time a complete calculation of the real NLO corrections at leading power in $1/P_\perp$. Our result exhibits TMD factorisation, with the same hard factor as at tree-level and a NLO correction to the Weisz\"acker-Williams (WW) gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution which involves four Wilson-line operators. By studying different kinematical regimes for $K_\perp$ and for the radiated gluon, we recover all the quantum evolutions that were previously identified for this process at NLO: the B-JIMWLK high-energy evolution and the CSS evolution of the gluon WW TMD, and the DGLAP evolution of the gluon PDF. When both $K_\perp$ and the transverse momentum transferred by the target are large compared to $Q_s$, all the Wilson-line operators boil down to the unintegrated gluon distribution and our NLO result for the gluon TMD can be used to isolate the transverse-momentum dependent gluon splitting function.</description>

      <title>Constraining the new contributions to electron $g-2$ in a radiative neutrino mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments within a radiative neutrino mass model featuring TeV-scale scalar leptoquarks $S(3,1,-1/3)$ and $R(3,2,1/6)$. We utilize textures with decoupling electron and muon sectors, so that both electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments could receive internal chiral enhancements from different heavy up-type quarks while in the same time evading the stringent $\mu\to e\gamma$ constraint. A successful fit to neutrino oscillation data requires the simultaneous presence of one- and two-loop neutrino mass contributions. This severely constrains the parameter space of the model, which results in a negligible new physics correction to the muon $g-2$. The electron $g-2$ discrepancy implied by the rubidium experiment, on the other hand, can be resolved within $2\sigma$ uncertainty provided that neutrino mass ordering is inverted. Lepton-flavor-violating tau decay rates, such as $\tau\to e\gamma$ and $\tau\to 3e$, are predicted to be within the sensitivities of next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring rapidity regularization schemes at low $x$ with the DIS longitudinal structure function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose three possible rapidity regulators for higher-order calculations in low $x$ QCD with gluon saturation, as alternatives to the usual lower cut-off for the integrals over the light-cone momentum $k^+$. These rapidity regulators are closely related to the $\eta$ regulator and to the pure rapidity regulator, which have been used primarily in studies of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization within the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). By choosing one of the three rapidity regulators that we propose, formulated in terms of $k^+$, $k^-$ or rapidity respectively, one can set from the start of the calculation in which of these three variables one wishes to formulate the low $x$ evolution equations, which is one of the main advantages of our approach.
  As a test of the viability of these rapidity regulators and of their practical implementation in higher order calculations with gluon saturation effects, we use them to revisit the calculation of the NLO corrections to the dipole factorization of the $F_L$ structure function in inclusive DIS at low $x$.</description>

      <title>Testing new-physics scenarios with the combined LHAASO and Carpet-3 fluence spectrum of GRB 221009A: axion-like particles and Lorentz-invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected: &gt;10 TeV with LHAASO and &gt;100 TeV with Carpet-3. Such energetic photons are expected to be absorbed via electron-positron pair production on their way to the Earth. Their observation might be explained by new physics, including Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon mixing with axion-like particles (ALPs). Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. LIV can account for the Carpet-3 observation, providing a modest improvement over standard physics in the overall fit. ALP mixing improves the description of both LHAASO and Carpet-3 data, yielding a substantial enhancement in fit quality for a specific region of the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Correlation Function/Wilson Loop Duality in Gauge Theory from EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we initiate a systematic study of the $n$-point correlation functions (CF) in gauge theories in the sequential light-cone (SLC) limit. Focusing on QCD, we formulate a factorization theorem for the CF of four vector currents in this limit using tools from soft-collinear effective field theory (SCET). This result unveils a duality between CF and Wilson loops in non-conformal field theories, according to which the singular structure of the CF is described by a null polygonal Wilson loop dressed by universal jet functions and current form factors, directly related to well-known ingredients in collider physics. We employ this new factorization theorem to obtain the singular terms of the four-point CF in QCD in the SLC limit up to three loops. This constitutes the first determination of terms beyond one loop and in particular determines, for the first time, conformal-symmetry-breaking terms induced by the non-vanishing $\beta$-function of QCD. As a stringent check, we verify that our result satisfies the anomalous conformal Ward identities and its leading-transcendental term reproduces the known correlation function in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM to three loops. Our results are easily generalized to the multi-point case, offering a powerful tool for future applications of SCET to the study of the fundamental structure of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Heterotic Footprints in Classical Gravity: PM dynamics from On-Shell soft amplitudes at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical scattering of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. Working in the classical (Post-Minkowskian) regime, we extract the conservative two-body potential by expanding the one loop amplitudes in the soft regime. We show explicitly that, as in GR, the relevant soft amplitudes are infrared (IR) finite once the long-range interactions are consistently treated via Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the associated IR subtraction. The scattering angle is then obtained from the eikonal exponentiation of the soft amplitude. Our results track the separate roles of electromagnetic and dilatonic charges in both the conservative dynamics and the eikonal phase, and they reduce smoothly to the GR limit when the charges and dilaton coupling are switched off. Where applicable, we compare with existing results in the literature and find agreement. These findings provide amplitude-based benchmarks for compact-object dynamics in EMD and furnish building blocks for waveform modeling in beyond-GR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.</description>

      <title>Weakly turbulent saturation of the nonlinear scalar ergoregion instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability, leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Constraints on inelastic dark matter from the CDEX-1B experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present limits on spin-independent inelastic WIMP-nucleus scattering using the 737.1 kg $\cdot$ day dataset from the CDEX-1B experiment. Expected nuclear recoil spectra for various inelastic WIMP masses $m_\chi$ and mass splittings $\delta$ are calculated under the standard halo model. An accurate background model of CDEX-1B is constructed by simulating all major background sources. The model parameters are then determined through maximum likelihood estimation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting. The resulting 90\% confidence level upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}$ exclude certain DAMA/LIBRA allowed regions: the $\chi^2 &lt; 4$ regions for $\delta &lt; 30$ keV at $m_\chi = 250$ GeV and the $\chi^2 &lt; 9$ region for $\delta &lt; 50$ keV at $m_\chi = 500$ GeV. The method is applicable to other inelastic dark matter scenarios, and the upcoming CDEX-50 experiment is expected to improve sensitivity by four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Probing the Neutron Skin with Extreme Collision Geometries in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how protons and neutrons are located differently in an atomic nucleus can provide fundamental information on nuclear structure and have far-reaching implications for astrophysics. A precise determination of this important difference, often quantified by the so-called neutron skin thickness, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally. Here we show how one can use a new category of observables in heavy ion collisions to probe the neutron skin thickness of nuclei like $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca, by utilizing the asymmetry between neutrons and protons of spectator nucleons in super-central collisions as well as that of participant nucleons in peripheral collisions. Using quantitative simulations, we demonstrate their sensitivity and great potential in constraining neutron skin thickness for both $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca nuclei in these extreme event geometries. Furthermore, we propose the asymmetric collisions between $^{48}$Ca and $^{40}$Ca nuclei as a unique and powerful way to nail down the neutron skin thickness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic flow of deuterons is measured on simulated collisions events of Pb+Pb at CMS energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair. We use hybrid model that includes hydrodynamics for the deconfined phase and hadron transport as an afterburner. For deuterons, two production mechanisms are examined: coalescence, and direct thermal production during hadronisation and subsequent transport through the hadronic phase. Differential elliptic flow of deuterons in different centrality bins is evaluated for both implemented production models. In this approach, coalescence describes the experimental data better than direct deuteron production.</description>

      <title>The large-$N$ limit of the topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory for $3\le N \le 6$, and adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to bypass topological freezing for $N&gt;3$. Thanks to this algorithm I am able to explore a uniform range of lattice spacing across all values of $N$, and to precisely determine $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous studies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum limit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from this choice. I conclude providing a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Iterated Agent for Symbolic Regression</title>

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact, physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is publicly available at https://www.ideasearch.cn/.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes, Charge, and Dark Matter: Rethinking Evaporation Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark dipole radiation on eccentric supermassive black hole binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.</description>

      <title>Probing the Higgs Portal at the Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.11670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) experiments, MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and SBND, are expected to have significant sensitivity to light weakly coupled hidden sector particles. Here we study the capability of the SBN experiments to probe dark scalars interacting through the Higgs portal. We investigate production of dark scalars using both the Fermilab Booster 8 GeV and NuMI 120 GeV proton beams, simulating kaons decaying to dark scalars and taking into account the beamline geometry. We also investigate strategies to mitigate backgrounds from beam-related neutrino scattering events. We find that SBND, with its comparatively short ${\cal O}(100\ {\rm m})$ baseline, will have the best sensitivity to scalars produced with Booster, while ICARUS, with its large detector volume, will provide the best limits on off-axis dark scalar production from NuMI. The SBN experiments can provide leading tests of dark scalars with masses in the 50 - 350 MeV range in the near term. Our results motivate dedicated experimental searches for dark scalars and other long-lived hidden sector states at these experiments.</description>

      <title>Getting More Out of Black Hole Superradiance: a Statistically Rigorous Approach to Ultralight Boson Constraints from Black Hole Spin Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) superradiance can provide strong constraints on the properties of ultralight bosons (ULBs). While most of the previous work has focused on the theoretical predictions, here we investigate the most suitable statistical framework to constrain ULB masses and self-interactions using BH spin measurements. We argue that a Bayesian approach based on a simple timescales analysis provides a clear statistical interpretation, deals with limitations regarding the reproducibility of existing BH analyses, incorporates the full information from BH data, and allows us to include additional nuisance parameters or to perform hierarchical modelling with BH populations in the future. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using mass and spin posterior samples for the X-ray binary BH M33 X-7 and, for the first time in this context, the supermassive BH IRAS 09149-6206. We explain the differences to existing ULB constraints in the literature and illustrate the effects of various assumptions about the superradiance process (equilibrium regime vs cloud collapse, higher occupation levels). As a result, our procedure yields the most statistically rigorous ULB constraints available in the literature, with important implications for the QCD axion and axion-like particles. We encourage all groups analysing BH data to publish likelihood functions or posterior samples as supplementary material to facilitate this type of analysis, and for theory developments to compress their findings to effective timescale modifications.</description>

      <title>Prospects for sub-EW-scale ALP searches via $\gamma+b\bar{b}$ signatures at the LHC using jet substructure techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data show no clear indication of new physics and only incremental improvements are anticipated at the energy frontier in the near future. However, while the focus of the LHC has been on constraining TeV scale physics, new particles could still be hiding below the electroweak scale. In order to obtain sensitivity to a new light boson with couplings to SM fermions, a potentially promising decay channel, for resonances with mass $\gtrsim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV, would be the decay to $b\bar b$ pairs. The measurement of such signatures is challenging due to the trigger requirements at the LHC. In this work, we explore the LHC sensitivity to a light pseudoscalar, or axion-like particle (ALP), in the $b\bar{b}$ final state with an associated photon, using jet substructure techniques, in the mass range between 10 GeV and 100 GeV. We obtain projected exclusions on the ALP-fermion coupling in a region of phase space which has not so far been probed by direct searches. We further discuss the impact that lower trigger thresholds may have on the LHC reach.</description>

      <title>Neutrino force at all length scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model predicts a long-range force mediated by a pair of neutrinos, known as ``the neutrino force". It scales as $G_F^2/r^5$, where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant. However, as $r \lesssim \sqrt{G_F}$, the four-Fermi theory breaks down and the neutrino force no longer has the $1/r^5$ scaling. For the first time, we derive a complete expression for the neutrino force that is valid at all distances. For $r \gg \sqrt{G_F}$, the result reduces to the known $G_F^2/r^5$; for $r \ll \sqrt{G_F}$, it scales as $1/r$. We explore the implications of this result for atomic parity violation (APV) experiments. A key feature of the neutrino force is that it is a long-range effect compared to the atomic length scale. Thus, in general, it cannot be simply treated as a correction to the tree-level $Z$-exchange diagram without considering the atomic wavefunctions. We calculate the effects in muonium and positronium, finding that the neutrino force contributes about 4\% and 16\%, respectively, compared to the leading $ Z$ exchange. This indicates a significant impact on APV, with important implications for detecting the neutrino force and measuring the weak mixing angle in APV experiments.</description>

      <title>1 Particle - 1 Qubit: Particle Physics Data Encoding for Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce 1P1Q, a novel quantum data encoding scheme for high-energy physics (HEP), where each particle is assigned to an individual qubit, enabling direct representation of collision events without classical compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 1P1Q in quantum machine learning (QML) through two applications: a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection and a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) for supervised classification of top quark jets. Our results show that the QAE successfully distinguishes signal jets from background QCD jets, achieving superior performance compared to a classical autoencoder while utilizing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Similarly, the VQC achieves competitive classification performance, approaching state-of-the-art classical models despite its minimal computational complexity. Furthermore, we validate the QAE on real experimental data from the CMS detector, establishing the robustness of quantum algorithms in practical HEP applications. These results demonstrate that 1P1Q provides an effective and scalable quantum encoding strategy, offering new opportunities for applying quantum computing algorithms in collider data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent LHCb Collaboration analysis, we have investigated the process $B^-\to J/\psi\eta^\prime K^-$ by considering the contributions from the resonances $Y(4710)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$. Our results are in good agreement with the measured invariant mass distributions and the Dalitz plot of LHCb, which supports the existence of the $K_0^*(1430)$ and the $Y(4710)$ in the process $B^-\to J/\psi\eta^\prime K^-$. Since the decay mode of $Y(4710)\to J/\psi \eta'$ is Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) suppressed for the charmonium state, the measurements of the $\mathcal{B}(Y(4710)\to J/\psi\eta')$ through the process $B^-\to J/\psi \eta' K^-$ or other processes is helpful to understanding the nature of the $Y(4710)$. Thus, we advocate that Belle~II and LHCb Collaborations could perform the more precise analysis to confirm the evidence of the $Y(4710)$ state, which could be helpful to reduce the experimental uncertainties of its mass and width, and to explore its nature.</description>

Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are crucial non-perturbative components in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), playing a vital role in predictions and understanding of the hadronization process. In this paper, we present the FFs for $K_S^0$, $\eta$, $\pi^0$ mesons, and $\Lambda$ baryons in the context of global QCD analysis. The data included in the fit are from single inclusive $e^+ e^-$ annihilation (SIA), semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and proton-proton collisions, with kinematic cuts carefully applied to ensure validity of collinear factorization and perturbative QCD expansion. For the first time, data from SIDIS and hadron-in-jet production in SIA have been incorporated into the extraction of FFs for light-flavor neutral hadrons. Our analysis reveals that these data play a critical role in constraining the gluon distribution, and in distinguishing between different quark flavors. Pulls from different datasets are also studied by performing alternative fits with systematically subtracting groups of data from the nominal fit. For the quality of the fit, good $\chi^2$ values are achieved for most of the datasets, and FFs are generally well constrained within the momentum fraction region $\pqty{0.1, 0.5}$. The extracted $K_S^0$ fragmentation functions, together with the $K_S^0$ FFs constructed from $K^{\pm}$ FFs via isospin symmetry, are used to test isospin symmetry in kaon fragmentation. Although a definitive conclusion cannot be reached yet, these studies have identified several potential measurements that can be performed at existing facilities, which may ultimately help us to arrive at a conclusive answer. With the comprehensive species of FFs extracted within the NPC framework, we are able to perform a test on the momentum sum rule with the light-flavor charged and neutral hadrons.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of matching of the high-energy resummation based on the BFKL equation with initial state radiation effects, taken into account within the framework of high-energy factorization, in the production of Mueller-Navelet dijets at hadron colliders. We use the RG-invariant solution of the NLO BFKL equation built out of eigenfunctions perturbatively constructed up to NLO to avoid the need for special renormalization scale setting. We demonstrate that various data sets from the FNAL Tevatron and CERN LHC can be described in this way and both the initial state radiation effects of the high-energy factorization and the NLL BFKL resummation are crucial for the uniform description of the data across all values of the rapidity difference between the jets. The behaviour of angular distributions and ratios of angular coefficients with increasing rapidity separation between the jets provides clear evidence for the NLL BFKL dynamics at the Tevatron and LHC.</description>

      <title>Meson-baryon scattering lengths without annihilation diagrams to order $p^4$ in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the threshold $T$ matrices of the meson and baryon processes that have no annihilation diagrams: $\pi^{+}\Sigma^{+}$, $\pi^{+}\Xi^0$, $K^+p$, $K^+n$, and $\bar{K}^0\Xi^0$ to the fourth order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. By performing least squares and Bayesian fits to the non-physical lattice QCD data, we determine the low-energy constants through both perturbative and non-perturbative iterative methods. By using these low-energy constants, we obtain the physical scattering lengths in these fits. The convergence behavior is not good across all channels in the perturbative method. The scattering lengths for the five channels, obtained by taking the median values from four different fitting approaches, are $a_{\pi^+\Sigma^+}=-0.16\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, $a_{\pi^+\Xi^0}=-0.04\pm0.04\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+p}=-0.41\pm 0.11\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+n}=-0.19\pm 0.10\,\text{fm}$, and $a_{\bar{K}^0\Xi^0}=-0.30\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, where the uncertainties are conservatively estimated by taking the maximum deviation between the median and extreme values of the statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Roles of $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1710)$ in Cabibbo-suppressed process $D^+\to \pi^0\pi^+\eta $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the BESIII amplitude analysis of the single Cabibbo-suppressed process $D^+\to \pi^0\pi^+\eta$, we investigate this reaction by taking into account the contributions from the $a_0(980)$, $\rho$, and $a_0(1710)$, where the scalar meson $a_0(980)$ could be dynamically generated from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interaction within the chiral unitary approach. Our theoretical predictions for the $\pi^0\eta$, $\pi^+\eta$, and $\pi^+\pi^0$ invariant mass distributions are in agreement with the BESIII measurements, especially the clear peaks around 1~GeV in the $\pi^0\eta$ and $\pi^+\eta$ invariant mass distributions could be associated with the dynamically generated state $a_0(980)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the intermediate $a_0(1710)$ is also necessary to describe the enhancement structure around $1.6\sim 1.7$~GeV in the $\pi^{0/+}\eta$ invariant mass distribution. More precise experimental measurements of this process could provide deeper insights into the nature of the scalar mesons $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1710)$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian truncation and quantum simulation of strong-field QED beyond tree level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in strong background fields provides an interesting class of problems for classical and quantum simulation. In this paper we formulate simulations of polarization (helicity) flip for a photon colliding with a high-intensity plane wave. Polarization flip is a one loop effect, which requires addressing new issues that do not arise in simulations of tree-level processes. Working in the momentum-space Fock basis, while convenient for the extraction of scattering amplitudes, requires tuning counterterms to cancel large cutoff effects. We compute analytic formulas for the counterterms at one loop. We then construct circuits for quantum simulations of the process, perform noiseless simulations on classical computers to assess discretization errors, and discuss resource estimates for future simulations on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Addressing the sign-problem in Euclidean path integrals with radial basis function neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving interacting field theories at finite densities remains a numerically and conceptually challenging task, even with modern computational capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on an expansion of the Euclidean path integrals using radial basis function neural networks, which allows the calculation of observables at finite densities and overcomes the sign problem in a numerically very efficient manner. The method is applied to an interacting complex scalar field theory at finite chemical potential in 3+1 dimensions, which exhibits both the sign problem and the silver blaze phenomenon, similar to QCD. The critical chemical potential at which phase transition occurs is estimated to be $\mu_c=1.17 \pm 0.018$, and the silver blaze problem is accurately described below $\mu_c$.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Evolution of Power-Suppressed Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new class of evolution equations which govern the high-energy behavior of power-suppressed scattering amplitudes. The equations can be viewed as a renormalization group flow with respect to the relevant effective field theory cutoff. A distinct feature of the method is in the use of a multidimensional cutoff to separate the relevant scales in problems characterized by a complex factorization structure. By adjusting the renormalization group variables to the geometry of the effective theory modes, our method naturally extends to a broad spectrum of physical problems including massive, massless, small, and wide angle scattering. We present applications to the benchmark processes of electron-positron forward annihilation and light quark mediated Higgs boson production/decays.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic probes as signatures for a first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dimuon production in the context of a first-order phase transition in QCD matter using a chiral fluid dynamics model. This approach incorporates non-equilibrium effects such as entropy production and reheating, which emerge during the dynamical evolution through a first-order phase transition. By comparing equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios across a range of beam energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.2-6.2$~GeV), we analyze the resulting invariant mass spectra. Our results reveal a substantial enhancement of dilepton yields in the non-equilibrium scenario, particularly pronounced at lower beam energies, where reheating leads to a prolonged lifetime of the fireball and increased emission. The enhancement persists even after normalizing to pion multiplicities, indicating sensitivity beyond effects of entropy production.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR as an Axion Helioscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to investigating axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) by studying their potential conversion into X-rays within the Sun's atmospheric magnetic field. Utilizing high-sensitivity data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) collected during the 2020 solar minimum, along with advanced solar atmospheric magnetic field models, we establish a new limit on the axion-photon coupling strength $g_{a\gamma}\lesssim 7.3\times 10^{-12}$~GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% CL for axion masses $m_a\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$\,eV. This constraint surpasses current ground-based experimental limits, studying previously unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to masses of $m_a\lesssim 3.4\times 10^{-4}$\,eV. These findings mark a significant advancement in our ability to probe axion properties and strengthen indirect searches for dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Effect of transverse momentum conservation and flow on symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetric cumulants can improve our understanding of the joint probability distribution function $ P\left ( v_{m},v_{n},v_{k}, \dots,\Psi _{m},\Psi _{n},\Psi _{k},\dots \right )$, potentially offering new insights into the nature of the fluctuations of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this work, the four-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, six-particle symmetric cumulants $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$, and the normalized cumulants $nsc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nsc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ originating from transverse momentum conservation, collective flow, and the interplay between the two effects are calculated. Our results on $sc_{2,3} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ are consistent with the ATLAS data using the subevent cumulant method, facilitating a more profound understanding of the origins of the symmetric cumulant in small systems. Our results on $sc_{2,3,4} \left \{ 6 \right \}$ serve as theoretical predictions for future experimental measurements in small systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal O(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to the critical impact parameter obtained in hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution ${\rm d} M/{\rm d}E$ and fallback rate ${\rm d} M/{\rm d} T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a first-principle construction of baryons as quantum Hall droplets in single-flavor holographic QCD. The baryons are described as charged D6-branes with a circular boundary on a flavor D8-brane in the Type IIA backgrounds dual to the confining and non-confining phases. The holographic description allows us to calculate precisely their properties, such as mass and size. We also consider other objects with baryonic charge, such as vortons, domain walls with holes, and "sandwich vortons", and discuss the relative (meta)stability of all these configurations.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very-long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given</description>

      <title>Extended momentum-dependent interaction for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02448</link>

Abstract: The momentum-dependent interaction (MDI) model, which has been widely used in microscopic transport models for heavy-ion collisions (HICs), is extended to include three different momentum-dependent terms and three zero-range density-dependent terms, dubbed as MDI3Y model. Compared to the MDI model, the single-nucleon potential in the MDI3Y model exhibits more flexible momentum-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, the inclusion of three zero-range density-dependent interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion, allowing more flexible variation for the largely uncertain high-density behaviors of nuclear matter equation of state (EOS), especially the symmetry energy. Moreover, we also obtain the corresponding Skyrme-like energy density functional through density matrix expansion of the finite-range exchange interactions. Based on the MDI3Y model, we construct four interactions with the same symmetry energy slope parameter $L=35$ MeV but different momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, by fitting the empirical nucleon optical potential, the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter, the microscopic calculations of pure neutron matter EOS and the astrophysical constraints on neutron stars. In addition, two interactions with $L=55$ and $75$ MeV are also constructed for comparison. Using these MDI3Y interactions, we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. These MDI3Y interactions, especially those with non-monotonic momentum dependence of $U_{\mathrm{sym}}$, will be potentially useful in transport model analyses of HICs data to extract nuclear matter EOS and the isospin splitting of nucleon effective masses.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Comparing Minimal and Non-Minimal Quintessence Models to 2025 DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w&lt;-1$ and then relaxes to $w&gt;-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.</description>
