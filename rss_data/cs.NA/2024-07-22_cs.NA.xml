      <title>Space-time waveform relaxation multigrid for Navier-Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time finite-element discretizations are well-developed in many areas of science and engineering, but much work remains within the development of specialized solvers for the resulting linear and nonlinear systems. In this work, we consider the all-at-once solution of the discretized Navier-Stokes equations over a space-time domain using waveform relaxation multigrid methods. In particular, we show how to extend the efficient spatial multigrid relaxation methods from [37] to a waveform relaxation method, and demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting monolithic Newton-Krylov-multigrid solver. Numerical results demonstrate the scalability of the solver for varying discretization order and physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Robust error estimates of PINN in one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to approximate solutions to one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations and establish robust error estimates of PINN regardless of the quantities of the coefficients. In particular, we rigorously demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of solutions using the Sobolev space theory based on a variational approach. Deriving $L^2$-contraction estimates, we show that the error, defined as the mean square for differences at the sample points between the true solution and our trial function, is dominated by the training loss. Furthermore, we show that as the quantities of the coefficients for the differential equation increase, the error-to-loss ratio rapidly decreases. Our theoretical and experimental results confirm the robustness of the error regardless of the quantities of the coefficients.</description>

      <title>Structure preserving hybrid Finite Volume Finite Element method for compressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we present a novel and efficient numerical method for the compressible viscous and resistive MHD equations for all Mach number regimes. The time-integration strategy is a semi-implicit splitting, combined with a hybrid finite-volume and finite-element (FE) discretization in space. The non-linear convection is solved by a robust explicit FV scheme, while the magneto-acoustic terms are treated implicitly in time. The resulting CFL stability condition depends only on the fluid velocity, and not on the Alfv\'enic and acoustic modes. The magneto-acoustic terms are discretized by compatible FE based on a continuous and a discrete de Rham complexes designed using Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). Thanks to the use of FEEC, energy stability, magnetic-helicity conservation and the divergence-free conditions can be preserved also at the discrete level. A very efficient splitting approach is used to separate the acoustic and the Alfv\'enic modes in such a fashion that the original symmetries of the PDE governing equations are preserved. In this way, the algorithm relies on the solution of linear, symmetric and positive-definite algebraic systems, that are very efficiently handled by the simple matrix-free conjugate-gradient method. The resulting algorithm showed to be robust and accurate in low and high Mach regimes even at large Courant numbers. Non-trivial tests are solved in one-, two- and three- space dimensions to confirm the robustness, accuracy, and the low-dissipative and conserving properties of the final algorithm. While the formulation of the method is very general, numerical results for a second-order accurate FV-FE scheme will be presented.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary order approximations at constant cost for Timoshenko beam network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the numerical solution of Timoshenko beam network models, comprised of Timoshenko beam equations on each edge of the network, which are coupled at the nodes of the network using rigid joint conditions. Through hybridization, we can equivalently reformulate the problem as a symmetric positive definite system of linear equations posed on the network nodes. This is possible since the nodes, where the beam equations are coupled, are zero-dimensional objects. To discretize the beam network model, we propose a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method that can achieve arbitrary orders of convergence under mesh refinement without increasing the size of the global system matrix. As a preconditioner for the typically very poorly conditioned global system matrix, we employ a two-level overlapping additive Schwarz method. We prove uniform convergence of the corresponding preconditioned conjugate gradient method under appropriate connectivity assumptions on the network. Numerical experiments support the theoretical findings of this work.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the inverse source problem for fractional diffusion-wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the inverse source problem for the fractional diffusion-wave equation, characterized by a source comprising spatial and temporal components. The investigation is primarily concerned with practical scenarios where data is collected subsequent to an incident. We establish the uniqueness of either the spatial or the temporal component of the source, provided that the temporal component exhibits an asymptotic expansion at infinity. Taking anomalous diffusion as a typical example, we gather the asymptotic behavior of one of the following quantities: the concentration on partial interior region or at a point inside the region, or the flux on partial boundary or at a point on the boundary. The proof is based on the asymptotic expansion of the solution to the fractional diffusion-wave equation. Notably, our approach does not rely on the conventional vanishing conditions for the source components. We also observe that the extent of uniqueness is dependent on the fractional order.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the Variational Iteration Method for Klein-Gordon Problems with Variable Coefficients II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate convergence for the Variational Iteration Method (VIM) which was introduced and described in \cite{He0},\cite{He1}, \cite{He2}, and \cite{He3}. We prove the convergence of the iteration scheme for a linear Klein-Gorden equation with a variable coefficient whose unique solution is known. The iteration scheme depends on a {\em Lagrange multiplier}, $\lambda(r,s)$, which is represented as a power series. We show that the VIM iteration scheme converges uniformly on compact intervals to the unique solution. We also prove convergence when $\lambda(r,s)$ is replaced by any of its partial sums. The first proof follows a familiar pattern, but the second requires a new approach. The second approach also provides some detail regarding the structure of the iterates.</description>

Abstract: We consider divergence-based high order discretizations of an $L^2$-based first order system least squares formulation of a second order elliptic equation with Robin boundary conditions. For smooth geometries, we show optimal convergence rates in the $L^2(\Omega)$ norm for the scalar variable. Convergence rates for the $L^2(\Omega)$-norm error of the gradient of the scalar variable as well as vectorial variable are also derived. Numerical examples illustrate the analysis.</description>

      <title>Computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates by the normalized gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an efficient and accurate numerical method for computing ground states of spin-2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by using the normalized gradient flow (NGF). In order to successfully extend the NGF to spin-2 BECs which has five components in the vector wave function but with only two physical constraints on total mass conservation and magnetization conservation, two important techniques are introduced for designing the proposed numerical method. The first one is to systematically investigate the ground state structure and property of spin-2 BECs within a spatially uniform system, which can be used on how to properly choose initial data in the NGF for computing ground states of spin-2 BECs. The second one is to introduce three additional projection conditions based on the relations between the chemical potentials, together with the two existing physical constraints, such that the five projection parameters used in the projection step of the NGF can be uniquely determined. Then a backward-forward Euler finite difference method is adapted to discretize the NGF. We prove rigorously that there exists a unique solution of the nonlinear system for determining the five projection parameters in the full discretization of the NGF under a mild condition on the time step size. Extensive numerical results on ground states of spin-2 BECs with ferromagnetic/nematic/cyclic phase and harmonic/optical lattice/box potential in one/two dimensions are reported to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method and to demonstrate several interesting physical phenomena on ground states of spin-2 BECs.</description>

      <title>Neural topology optimization: the good, the bad, and the ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) hold great promise for advancing inverse design via topology optimization (TO), yet misconceptions about their application persist. This article focuses on neural topology optimization (neural TO), which leverages NNs to reparameterize the decision space and reshape the optimization landscape. While the method is still in its infancy, our analysis tools reveal critical insights into the NNs' impact on the optimization process. We demonstrate that the choice of NN architecture significantly influences the objective landscape and the optimizer's path to an optimum. Notably, NNs introduce non-convexities even in otherwise convex landscapes, potentially delaying convergence in convex problems but enhancing exploration for non-convex problems. This analysis lays the groundwork for future advancements by highlighting: 1) the potential of neural TO for non-convex problems and dedicated GPU hardware (the "good"), 2) the limitations in smooth landscapes (the "bad"), and 3) the complex challenge of selecting optimal NN architectures and hyperparameters for superior performance (the "ugly").</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding the resistors in a resistor network from measurements of the power dissipated by the resistors under different loads. We give sufficient conditions for local uniqueness, i.e. conditions that guarantee that the linearization of this non-linear inverse problem admits a unique solution. Our method is inspired by a method to study local uniqueness of inverse problems with internal functionals in the continuum, where the inverse problem is reformulated as a redundant system of differential equations. We use our method to derive local uniqueness conditions for other discrete inverse problems with internal functionals including a discrete analogue of the inverse Schr\"odinger problem and problems where the resistors are replaced by impedances and dissipated power at the zero and a positive frequency are available. Moreover, we show that the dissipated power measurements can be obtained from measurements of thermal noise induced currents.</description>

      <title>Reduced Data-Driven Turbulence Closure for Capturing Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, stochastic, a-posteriori, turbulence closure model based on a reduced subgrid scale term. This subgrid scale term is tailor-made to capture the statistics of a small set of spatially-integrate quantities of interest (QoIs), with only one unresolved scalar time series per QoI. In contrast to other data-driven surrogates the dimension of the ``learning problem" is reduced from an evolving field to one scalar time series per QoI. We use an a-posteriori, nudging approach to find the distribution of the scalar series over time. This approach has the advantage of taking the interaction between the solver and the surrogate into account. A stochastic surrogate parametrization is obtained by random sampling from the found distribution for the scalar time series. Compared to an a-priori trained convolutional neural network, evaluating the new method is computationally much cheaper and gives similar long-term statistics.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the numerical stability of the covariant Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura (cBSSN) formulation against the Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker spacetime. To evaluate the numerical stability, we calculate the constraint amplification factor by the eigenvalue analysis of the evolution of the constraint. We propose a modification to the time evolution equations of the cBSSN formulation for a higher numerical stability. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations using the modified formulation to confirm its improved stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.01002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look at computational physics from an electrical engineering perspective and suggest that several concepts of mathematics, not so well-established in computational physics literature, present themselves as opportunities in the field. We discuss elliptic complexes and highlight the category theoretical background and its role as a unifying language between algebraic topology, differential geometry, and modelling software design. In particular, the ubiquitous concept of naturality is central. Natural differential operators have functorial analogues on the cochains of triangulated manifolds. In order to establish this correspondence, we derive formulas involving simplices and barycentric coordinates, defining discrete vector fields and a discrete Lie derivative as a result of a discrete analogue of Cartan's magic formula. This theorem is the main mathematical result of the paper.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: symplecticity and low regularity in Runge-Kutta resonance-based schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increasing amount of research devoted to the development of so-called resonance-based methods for dispersive nonlinear partial differential equations. In many situations, this new class of methods allows for approximations in a much more general setting (e.g. for rough data) than, for instance, classical splitting or exponential integrator methods. However, they lack one important property: the preservation of geometric properties of the flow. This is particularly drastic in the case of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) which are fundamental models in the broad field of dispersive infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, possessing infinitely many conserved quantities, an important property which we wish to capture - at least up to some degree - also on the discrete level. Nowadays, a wide range of structure preserving integrators for Hamiltonian systems are available, however, typically these existing algorithms can only approximate highly regular solutions efficiently. State-of-the-art low-regularity integrators, on the other hand, poorly preserve the geometric structure of the underlying PDE. In this work we introduce a novel framework, so-called Runge-Kutta resonance-based methods, for a large class of dispersive nonlinear equations which incorporate a much larger amount of degrees of freedom than prior resonance-based schemes while featuring similarly favourable low-regularity convergence properties. In particular, for the KdV and NLSE case, we are able to bridge the gap between low regularity and structure preservation by characterising a large class of symplectic (in the Hamiltonian picture) resonance-based methods for both equations that allow for low-regularity approximations to the solution while preserving the underlying geometric structure of the continuous problem on the discrete level.</description>

      <title>A stabilized time-domain combined field integral equation using the quasi-Helmholtz projectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a time-domain combined field integral equation for electromagnetic scattering by a perfect electric conductor. The new equation is obtained by leveraging the quasi-Helmholtz projectors, which separate both the unknown and the source fields into solenoidal and irrotational components. These two components are then appropriately rescaled to cure the solution from a loss of accuracy occurring when the time step is large. Yukawa-type integral operators of a purely imaginary wave number are also used as a Calderon preconditioner to eliminate the ill-conditioning of matrix systems. The stabilized time-domain electric and magnetic field integral equations are linearly combined in a Calderon-like fashion, then temporally discretized using an appropriate pair of trial functions, resulting in a marching-on-in-time linear system. The novel formulation is immune to spurious resonances, dense discretization breakdown, large-time step breakdown and dc instabilities stemming from non-trivial kernels. Numerical results for both simply-connected and multiply-connected scatterers corroborate the theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: New differential-recurrence relations for B-spline basis functions are given. Using these relations, a recursive method for finding the Bernstein-B\'{e}zier coefficients of B-spline basis functions over a single knot span is proposed. The algorithm works for any knot sequence and has an asymptotically optimal computational complexity. Numerical experiments show that the new method gives results which preserve a high number of digits when compared to an approach which uses the well-known de Boor-Cox formula.</description>

Here, we consider a more general class of matrix-sequences and we prove that they belong to the maximal $*$-algebra of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) matrix-sequences. Then, we identify the associated GLT symbols in the general setting and in the specific case, by providing in both cases a spectral and singular value analysis. More specifically, we use the GLT tools in order to study the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues and singular values of the considered BDF matrix-sequences, in connection with the given non-uniform grids. Numerical examples, visualizations, and open problems end the present work.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lehmann representation of three-point functions</title>

Abstract: We present a generalization of the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) to three-point correlation and vertex functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency. The representation takes the form of a linear combination of judiciously chosen exponentials in imaginary time, and products of simple poles in Matsubara frequency, which are universal for a given temperature and energy cutoff. We present a systematic algorithm to generate compact sampling grids, from which the coefficients of such an expansion can be obtained by solving a linear system. We show that the explicit form of the representation can be used to evaluate diagrammatic expressions involving infinite Matsubara sums, such as polarization functions or self-energies, with controllable, high-order accuracy. This collection of techniques establishes a framework through which methods involving three-point objects can be implemented robustly, with a substantially reduced computational cost and memory footprint.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as a unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks are attracting the interest of scientific community since the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behavior in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work we present the preliminary results of a IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels.</description>
