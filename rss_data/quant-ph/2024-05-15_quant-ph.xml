      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in systems with diffusive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between scrambling and projective measurements can lead to measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIPT). In this work, we show that the universality class of the MIPT is drastically altered when the system is coupled to a diffusing conserved density. Specifically, we consider a 1+1d random Clifford circuit locally monitored by classically diffusing particles (``measurers''). The resulting diffusive correlations in the measurement density are a relevant perturbation to the usual space-time random MIPT critical point, producing a new universality class for this phase transition. We find ``Griffiths-like'' effects due to rare space-time regions where, e.g., the diffusive measurers have a low or high density, but these are considerably weaker than the Griffiths effects that occur with quenched randomness that produce rare spatial regions with infinite lifetime.</description>

      <title>On the quantum origin of limit cycles, fixed points, and critical slowing down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Finite and Infinite Size Stability in Quadratic Bosonic Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework for understanding dynamical metastability in open many-body systems of free bosons, whereby the dynamical stability properties of the system in the infinite-size (thermodynamic) limit may sharply differ from those of any finite-size truncation, and anomalous transient dynamics may arise. By leveraging pseudospectral techniques, we trace the discrepancy between asymptotic and transient dynamics to the non-normality of the underlying quadratic bosonic Lindbladian (QBL) generator, and show that two distinct flavors of dynamical metastability can arise. QBLs exhibiting type I dynamical metastability, previously discussed in the context of anomalous transient amplification [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 245701 (2021)], are dynamically unstable in the infinite-size limit, yet stable once open boundaries are imposed. Type II-dynamically metastable QBLs, which we uncover in this work, are dynamically stable for infinite size, but become unstable under open boundary conditions for arbitrary finite system size. We exhibit representative models for both types of metastability in the dissipative, as well as the limiting closed-system (Hamiltonian) settings, and analyze distinctive physical behavior they can engender. We show that dynamical metastability manifests itself in the generation of entanglement entropy, by way of a transient which reflects the stability phase of the infinite (rather than the actual finite) system and, as a result, is directly tied to the emergence of super-volume scaling in type I systems. Finally, we demonstrate how, even in Hermitian, and especially in highly non-normal regimes, the spectral properties of an infinite-size QBL are reflected in the linear response functions of the corresponding finite QBLs, by way of resonant pseudospectral modes.</description>

      <title>Finite-element assembly approach of optical quantum walk networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-element approach for computing the aggregate scattering matrix of a network of linear coherent scatterers. These might be optical scatterers or more general scattering coins studied in quantum walk theory. While techniques exist for two-dimensional lattices of feed-forward scatterers, the present approach is applicable to any network configuration of any collection of scatterers. Unlike traditional finite-element methods in optics, this method does not directly solve Maxwell's equations; instead it is used to assemble and solve a linear, coupled scattering problem that emerges after Maxwell's equations are abstracted within the scattering matrix method. With this approach, a global unitary is assembled corresponding to one time step of the quantum walk on the network. After applying the relevant boundary conditions to this global matrix, the problem becomes non-unitary, and possesses a steady-state solution which is the output scattering state. We provide an algorithm to obtain this steady-state solution exactly using a matrix inversion, yielding the scattering state without requiring a direct calculation of the eigenspectrum. The approach is then numerically validated on a coupled-cavity interferometer example that possesses a known, closed-form solution. Finally, the method is shown to be a generalization of the Redheffer star product, which describes scatterers on one-dimensional lattices (2-regular graphs) and is often applied to the design of thin-film optics, making the current approach an invaluable tool for the design and validation of high-dimensional phase-reprogrammable optical devices and study of quantum walks on arbitrary graphs.</description>

      <title>Finite-size catalysis in quantum resource theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum catalysis, the ability to enable previously impossible transformations by using auxiliary systems without degrading them, has emerged as a powerful tool in various resource theories. Although catalytically enabled state transformations have been formally characterized by the monotonic behaviour of entropic quantifiers (e.g., the von Neumann entropy or non-equilibrium free energy), such characterizations often rely on unphysical assumptions, namely the ability of using catalysts of infinitely large dimension. This approach offers very limited insights into the practical significance of using catalysis for quantum information processing. Here, we address this problem across a broad class of quantum resource theories. Leveraging quantum information tools beyond the asymptotic regime, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of catalytic transformations with finite-size catalysts. We further unveil connections between finite-size catalysis and multi-copy transformations. Notably, we discover a fascinating phenomenon of catalytic resonance: by carefully tailoring the catalysts's state, one can drastically reduce the required dimension of the catalyst, thus enabling efficient catalytic transformations with minimal resources. Finally, we illustrate our findings with examples from the resource theories of entanglement and thermodynamics, as well in the context of catalytic unitary transformations.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Turbulence-resistant Lidar via Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a turbulence-resistant quantum Lidar system. As a key technology for sensing and ranging, Lidar has drawn considerable attention for a study from quantum perspective, in search of proven advantages complementary to the capabilities of conventional Lidar technologies. Environmental factors such as strong atmospheric turbulence can have detrimental effects on the performance of these systems. We demonstrate the possibility of turbulence-resistant operation of a quantum Lidar system via two-photon interference of entangled photon pairs. Additionally, the reported quantum Lidar also demonstrates the expected noise resistance. This study suggests a potential high precision timing-positioning technology operable under turbulence and noise.</description>

      <title>Time-adaptive phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase estimation is known to be a robust method for single-qubit gate calibration in quantum computers, while Bayesian estimation is widely used in devising optimal methods for learning in quantum systems. We present Bayesian phase estimation methods that adaptively choose a control phase and the time of coherent evolution based on prior phase knowledge. In the presence of noise, we find near-optimal performance with respect to known theoretical bounds, and demonstrate some robustness of the estimates to noise that is not accounted for in the model of the estimator, making the methods suitable for calibrating operations in quantum computers. We determine the utility of control parameter values using functions of the prior probability of the phase that quantify expected knowledge gain either in terms of expected narrowing of the posterior or expected information gain. In particular, we find that by maximising the rate of expected gain we obtain phase estimates having standard deviation a factor of 1.42 above the Heisenberg limit, which is the lowest value we know of for sequential phase estimation. The methods provide optimal solutions accounting for available prior knowledge and experimental imperfections with minimal effort from the user. The effect of many types of noise can be specified in the model of the measurement probabilities, and the rate of knowledge gain can easily be adjusted to account for times included in the measurement sequence other than the coherent evolution leading to the unknown phase, such as times required for state preparation or readout.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Local Landscape in the Triangle Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the set of distributions that can be realized in the triangle network is a notoriously difficult problem. In this work, we investigate inner approximations of the set of local (classical) distributions of the triangle network. A quantum distribution that appears to be nonlocal is the Elegant Joint Measurement (EJM) [Entropy. 2019; 21(3):325], which motivates us to study distributions having the same symmetries as the EJM. We compare analytical and neural-network-based inner approximations and find a remarkable agreement between the two methods. Using neural network tools, we also conjecture network Bell inequalities that give a trade-off between the levels of correlation and symmetry that a local distribution may feature. Our results considerably strengthen the conjecture that the EJM is nonlocal.</description>

      <title>Parameter optimization comparison in QAOA using Stochastic Hill Climbing with Random Re-starts and Local Search with entangled and non-entangled mixing operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Stochastic Hill Climbing with Random Restarts (SHC-RR) compared to Local Search (LS) strategies within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework across various problem models. Employing uniform parameter settings, including the number of restarts and SHC steps, we analyze LS with two distinct perturbation operations: multiplication and summation. Our comparative analysis encompasses multiple versions of max-cut and random Ising model (RI) problems, utilizing QAOA models with depths ranging from $1L$ to $3L$. These models incorporate diverse mixing operator configurations, which integrate $RX$ and $RY$ gates, and explore the effects of an entanglement stage within the mixing operator. We also used Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) to compare the different QAOA models, demonstrating the importance of the placement of the entanglement stage in the overall performance of QAOA. Additionally, we observed that the QFI values of previous parameters are not affected as the depth of the quantum circuit increases. Our results consistently show that SHC-RR outperforms LS approaches, showcasing superior efficacy despite its ostensibly simpler optimization mechanism. Furthermore, we observe that the inclusion of entanglement stages within mixing operators significantly impacts model performance, either enhancing or diminishing results depending on the specific problem context.</description>

      <title>Understanding Side-Channel Vulnerabilities in Superconducting Qubit Readout Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-multiplexing is an effective method to achieve resource-efficient superconducting qubit readout. Allowing multiple resonators to share a common feedline, the number of cables and passive components involved in the readout of a qubit can be drastically reduced. However, this improvement in scalability comes at the price of a crucial non-ideality -- an increased readout crosstalk. Prior works have targeted building better devices and discriminators to reduce its effects, as readout-crosstalk-induced qubit measurement errors are detrimental to the reliability of a quantum computer. However, in this work, we show that beyond the reliability of a system, readout crosstalk can introduce vulnerabilities in a system being shared among multiple users. These vulnerabilities are directly related to correlated errors due to readout crosstalk. These correlated errors can be exploited by nefarious attackers to predict the state of the victim qubits, resulting in information leakage.</description>

      <title>Enabling Leakage Reduction via Fast and High-Fidelity Qutrit Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to operating quantum processors effectively at practical scales. QECs are designed for systems comprising two-level systems, such as qubits, as their fundamental building block. Unfortunately, qubits can leak to third and higher energy levels, making these leaks challenging to detect and mitigate. If not addressed promptly, these leakage errors can proliferate and undermine QEC, leading to significant computational inaccuracies. Here, we present a high-fidelity three-level qubit readout protocol that is simple to implement on dedicated hardware such as FPGAs. Our design enables faster and higher-fidelity leakage detection over approaches using conventional qubit-state discriminators.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Decision Diagram-based Multi-node Quantum Simulation with Ring Communication and Automatic SWAP Insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An N-bit quantum state requires a vector of length $2^N$, leading to an exponential increase in the required memory with N in conventional statevector-based quantum simulators. A proposed solution to this issue is the decision diagram-based quantum simulator, which can significantly decrease the necessary memory and is expected to operate faster for specific quantum circuits. However, decision diagram-based quantum simulators are not easily parallelizable because data must be manipulated dynamically, and most implementations run on one thread. This paper introduces ring communication-based optimal parallelization and automatic swap insertion techniques for multi-node implementation of decision diagram-based quantum simulators. The ring communication approach is designed so that each node communicates with its neighboring nodes, which can facilitate faster and more parallel communication than broadcasting where one node needs to communicate with all nodes simultaneously. The automatic swap insertion method, an approach to minimize inter-node communication, has been employed in existing multi-node state vector-based simulators, but this paper proposes two methods specifically designed for decision diagram-based quantum simulators. These techniques were implemented and evaluated using the Shor algorithm and random circuits with up to 38 qubits using a maximum of 256 nodes. The experimental results have revealed that multi-node implementation can reduce run-time by up to 26 times. For example, Shor circuits that need 38 qubits can finish simulation in 147 seconds. Additionally, it was shown that ring communication has a higher speed-up effect than broadcast communication, and the importance of selecting the appropriate automatic swap insertion method was revealed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Distribution Delay Optimization in Quantum Networks with Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) distribute entangled states to enable distributed quantum computing and sensing applications. However, in such QNs, quantum switches (QSs) have limited resources that are highly sensitive to noise and losses and must be carefully allocated to minimize entanglement distribution delay. In this paper, a QS resource allocation framework is proposed, which jointly optimizes the average entanglement distribution delay and entanglement distillation operations, to enhance the end-to-end (e2e) fidelity and satisfy minimum rate and fidelity requirements. The proposed framework considers realistic QN noise and includes the derivation of the analytical expressions for the average quantum memory decoherence noise parameter, and the resulting e2e fidelity after distillation. Finally, practical QN deployment aspects are considered, where QSs can control 1) nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center SPS types based on their isotopic decomposition, and 2) nuclear spin regions based on their distance and coupling strength with the electron spin of NV centers. A simulated annealing metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the QS resource allocation optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed framework manages to satisfy all users rate and fidelity requirements, unlike existing distillation-agnostic (DA), minimal distillation (MD), and physics-agnostic (PA) frameworks which do not perform distillation, perform minimal distillation, and does not control the physics-based NV center characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed framework results in around 30% and 50% reductions in the average e2e entanglement distribution delay compared to existing PA and MD frameworks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed framework results in around 5%, 7%, and 11% reductions in the average e2e fidelity compared to existing DA, PA, and MD frameworks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a universal logical gate set on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is essential for achieving large-scale practical quantum computation. Implementing arbitrary FTQC requires the execution of a universal gate set on logical qubits, which is highly challenging. Particularly, in the superconducting system, two-qubit gates on surface code logical qubits have not been realized. Here, we experimentally implement logical CNOT gate as well as arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates on distance-2 surface codes using the superconducting quantum processor \textit{Wukong}, thereby demonstrating a universal logical gate set. In the experiment, we design encoding circuits to prepare the required logical states, where the fidelities of the fault-tolerantly prepared logical states surpass those of the physical states. Furthermore, we demonstrate the transversal CNOT gate between two logical qubits and fault-tolerantly prepare four logical Bell states, all with fidelities exceeding those of the Bell states on the physical qubits. Using the logical CNOT gate and an ancilla logical state, arbitrary single-qubit rotation gate is implemented through gate teleportation. All logical gates are characterized on a complete state set and their fidelities are evaluated by logical Pauli transfer matrices. Implementation of the universal logical gate set and entangled logical states beyond physical fidelity marks a significant step towards FTQC on superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Meta-Solving for Practical Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of quantum algorithms has initiated a discourse on the potential for quantum speedups for optimization problems. However, several factors still hinder a practical realization of the potential benefits. These include the lack of advanced, error-free quantum hardware, the absence of accessible software stacks for seamless integration and interaction, and the lack of methods that allow us to leverage the theoretical advantages to real-world use cases. This paper works towards the creation of an accessible hybrid software stack for solving optimization problems, aiming to create a fundamental platform that can utilize quantum technologies to enhance the solving process. We introduce a novel approach that we call Hybrid Meta-Solving, which combines classical and quantum optimization techniques to create customizable and extensible hybrid solvers. We decompose mathematical problems into multiple sub-problems that can be solved by classical or quantum solvers, and propose techniques to semi-automatically build the best solver for a given problem. Implemented in our ProvideQ toolbox prototype, Meta-Solving provides interactive workflows for accessing quantum computing capabilities. Our evaluation demonstrates the applicability of Meta-Solving in industrial use cases. It shows that we can reuse state-of-the-art classical algorithms and extend them with quantum computing techniques. Our approach is designed to be at least as efficient as state-of-the-art classical techniques, while having the potential to outperform them if future advances in the quantum domain are made.</description>

      <title>Atomic transport dynamics in crossed optical dipole trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of cold atoms in crossed optical dipole trap theoretically and experimentally. The atomic transport process is accompanied by two competitive kinds of physical mechanics, atomic loading and atomic loss. The loading process normally is negligible in the evaporative cooling experiment on the ground, while it is significant in the preparation of ultra-cold atoms in the space station. Normally, the atomic loading process is much weaker than the atomic loss process, and the atomic number in the center region of the trap decreases monotonically, as reported in previous research. However, when the atomic loading process is comparable to the atomic loss process, the atomic number in the center region of the trap will initially increase to a maximum value and then slowly decrease, and we have observed the phenomenon first. The increase of atomic number in the center region of the trap shows the presence of the loading process, and this will be significant especially under microgravity conditions. We build a theoretical model to analyze the competitive relationship, which coincides with the experimental results well. Furthermore, we have also given the predicted evolutionary behaviors under different conditions. This research provides a solid foundation for further understanding of the atomic transport process in traps. The analysis of loading process is of significant importance for the preparation of ultra-cold atoms in a crossed optical dipole trap under microgravity conditions.</description>

      <title>Full Band Structure Calculation of Semiconducting Materials on a Noisy Quantum Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a promising application in the era of quantum computing since the unique effects of quantum mechanics that take exponential growing resources to simulate classically are controllable on quantum computers. Fermionic degrees of freedom can be encoded efficiently onto qubits and allow for algorithms such as the Quantum Equation-of-Motion method to find the entire energy spectrum of a quantum system. In this paper, we propose the Reduced Quantum Equation-of-Motion method by reducing the dimensionality of its generalized eigenvalue equation, which results in half the measurements required compared to the Quantum Equation-of-Motion method, leading to speed up the algorithm and less noise accumulation on real devices. In particular, we analyse the performance of our method on two noise models and calculate the excitation energies of a bulk Silicon and Gallium Arsenide using our method on an IBM quantum processor. Our method is fully robust to the uniform depolarizing error and we demonstrate that the selection of suitable atomic orbital complexity could increase the robustness of our algorithm under real noise. We also find that taking the average of multiple experiments tends towards the correct energies due to the fluctuations around the exact values. Such noise resilience of our approach could be used on current quantum devices to solve quantum chemistry problems.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of quantum thermal machines: A gradient-based procedure to optimize their performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Amplified Simultaneous Quantum-Classical Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical free-space optical (FSO) communication promises massive data throughput rates relative to traditional wireless technologies - an attractive outcome now being pursued in the context of satellite-ground, inter-satellite and deep-space communications. The question we investigate here is: how can we minimally alter classical FSO systems, both in infrastructure and in energy input, to provide some element of quantum communication coexisting with classical communications? To address this question, we explore additional Gaussian displacements to classical FSO encoding on the satellite, determining the minimum signal requirements that will meet given specifications on the combined classical and quantum communications throughput. We then investigate whether enhanced quantum-based amplifiers embedded in receivers, which have proven advantageous in standalone quantum communication, can enhance our combined classical-quantum communication throughput. We show how this is indeed the case, but only at the cost of some additional receiver complexity, relative to standalone quantum communications. This additional complexity takes the form of an additional beamsplitter and two heterodyne detectors at the receiver. Our results illustrate a viable pathway to realising quantum communication from classical FSO systems with minimal design changes.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Controllability in Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse-based quantum machine learning (QML) models possess full expressivity when they are ensemble controllable. However, it has also been shown that barren plateaus emerge in such models, rendering training intractable for systems with large dimension. In this paper, we show that the trade-off is closely related to the controllability of the underlying pulse-based models. We first apply the Fliess-series expansion to pulse-based QML models to investigate the effect of control system structure on model expressivity, which leads to a universal criterion for assessing the expressivity of generic QML models. Guided by this criterion, we then demonstrate how designing pulse-based models on low-dimensional manifolds can balance expressivity and trainability. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the proposed criterion and our analysis, which futher demonstrate that increasing dimensionality enhances expressivity but avoids barren plateaus if the model is designed with limited controllability on a submanifold. Our approach provides a promising path for designing pulse-based QML models that are both highly expressive and trainable.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Achieving Chemical Accuracy with Quantum Computing Enforced Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding accurate ground state energy of a many-body system has been a major challenge in quantum chemistry. The integration of classic and quantum computers has shed new light on resolving this outstanding problem. Here we propose QiankunNet-VQE, a transformer based language models enforced with quantum computing to learn and generate quantum states. It has been implemented using up to 12 qubits and attaining an accuracy level competitive with state-of-the-art classical methods. By leveraging both quantum and classical resources, this scheme overcomes the limitations of variational quantum eigensolver(VQE) without the need for cumbersome error mitigation. Moreover, QiankunNet-VQE provides a different route to achieve a practical quantum advantage for solving many-electron Schr\"odinger equation without requiring extremely precise preparation and measurement of the ground-state wavefunction on quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal QAOA protocol: Evidence of quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). In this algorithm, there are alternating layers consisting of a mixer and a problem Hamiltonian. Each layer $i=0,\ldots,p-1$ is parameterized by $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$. How to find these parameters has been an open question with the majority of the research focused on finding them using classical algorithms. In this work, we present evidence that fixed linear ramp schedules constitute a universal set of QAOA parameters, i.e., a set of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ parameters that rapidly approximate the optimal solution, $x^*$, independently of the COP selected, and that the success probability of finding it, $probability(x^*)$, increases with the number of QAOA layers $p$. We simulate linear ramp QAOA protocols (LR-QAOA) involving up to $N_q=42$ qubits and $p = 400$ layers on random instances of 9 different COPs. The results suggest that $probability(x^*) \approx 1/2^{(\eta N_q / p)}$ for a constant $\eta$. For example, when implementing LR-QAOA with $p=42$, the $probability(x^*)$ for 42-qubit Weighted MaxCut problems (W-MaxCut) increases from $2/2^{42}\approx 10^{-13}$ to an average of 0.13. We compare LR-QAOA, simulated annealing (SA), and branch-and-bound (B\&amp;B) finding a fundamental improvement in LR-QAOA. We test LR-QAOA on real hardware using IonQ Aria, Quantinuum H2-1, IBM Brisbane, IBM Kyoto, and IBM Osaka, encoding random weighted MaxCut (W-MaxCut) problems from 5 to 109 qubits and $p=3$ to $100$. Even for the largest case, $N_q=109$ qubits and $p=100$, information about the LR-QAOA optimization protocol is present. The circuit involved requires 21200 CNOT gates. These results show that LR-QAOA effectively finds high-quality solutions for COPs and suggests an advantage of quantum computation for combinatorial optimization in the near future.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nonclassicality of Multiphoton Optical Beams via Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of nonclassical features of multiphoton quantum states represents a task of the utmost importance in the development of many quantum photonic technologies. Under realistic experimental conditions, a photonic quantum state gets affected by its interaction with several nonideal opto-electronic devices, including those used to guide, detect or characterize it. The result of such noisy interaction is that the nonclassical features of the original quantum state get considerably reduced or are completely absent in the detected, final state. In this work, the self-learning features of artificial neural networks are exploited to experimentally show that the nonclassicality of multiphoton quantum states can be assessed and fully characterized, even in the cases in which the nonclassical features are concealed by the measuring devices. Our work paves the way toward artificial-intelligence-assisted experimental-setup characterization, as well as smart quantum-state nonclassicality identification.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of flexible stripline and coaxial cables for superconducting qubit control and readout pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comparative study on microwave control lines for a transmon qubit using: (i) flexible stripline transmission lines, and (ii) semi-rigid coaxial cables. During each experiment we performed repeated measurements of the energy relaxation and coherence times of a transmon qubit using one of the wiring configurations. Each measurement run spanned 70 h to 250 h of measurement time, and four separate cooldowns were performed so that each configuration could be tested twice. From these datasets we observe that changing the microwave control lines from coaxial cables to flexible stripline transmission lines does not have a measurable effect on coherence compared to thermal cycling the system, or random coherence fluctuations. Our results open up the possibility of large scale integration of qubit control lines with integrated component with planar layouts on flexible substrate.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ground States of Fermi-Hubbard Model on Honeycomb Lattices with Counterdiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the ground state properties of many-body quantum systems conventionally involves adiabatic processes, alongside exact diagonalization, in the context of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computation. Shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic driving serve to accelerate these processes by suppressing energy excitations. Motivated by this, we develop variational quantum algorithms incorporating the auxiliary counterdiabatic interactions, comparing them with digitized adiabatic algorithms. These algorithms are then implemented on gate-based quantum circuits to explore the ground states of the Fermi-Hubbard model on honeycomb lattices, utilizing systems with up to 26 qubits. The comparison reveals that the counter-diabatic inspired ansatz is superior to traditional Hamiltonian variational ansatz. Furthermore, the number and duration of Trotter steps are analyzed to understand and mitigate errors. Given the model's relevance to materials in condensed matter, our study paves the way for using variational quantum algorithms with counterdiabaticity to explore quantum materials in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Using an Evolutionary Algorithm to Create (MAX)-3SAT QUBOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common way of solving satisfiability instances with quantum methods is to transform these instances into instances of QUBO, which in itself is a potentially difficult and expensive task. State-of-the-art transformations from MAX-3SAT to QUBO currently work by mapping clauses of a 3SAT formula associated with the MAX-3SAT instance to an instance of QUBO and combining the resulting QUBOs into a single QUBO instance representing the whole MAX-3SAT instance. As creating these transformations is currently done manually or via exhaustive search methods and, therefore, algorithmically inefficient, we see potential for including search-based optimization. In this paper, we propose two methods of using evolutionary algorithms to automatically create QUBO representations of MAX-3SAT problems. We evaluate our created QUBOs on 500 and 1000-clause 3SAT formulae and find competitive performance to state-of-the-art baselines when using both classical and quantum annealing solvers.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Logical coherence in 2D compass codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D compass codes are a family of quantum error-correcting codes that contain the Bacon-Shor codes, the X-Shor and Z-Shor codes, and the rotated surface codes. Previous numerical results suggest that the surface code has a constant accuracy and coherence threshold under uniform coherent rotation. However, having analytical proof supporting a constant threshold is still an open problem. It is analytically proven that the toric code can exponentially suppress logical coherence in the code distance $L$. However, the current analytical lower bound on the threshold for the rotation angle $\theta$ is $|\sin(\theta)| &lt; 1/L$, which linearly vanishes in $L$ instead of being constant. We show that this lower bound is achievable by the Z-Shor code which does not have a threshold under stochastic noise. Compass codes provide a promising direction to improve on the previous bounds. We analytically determine thresholds for two new compass code families with thresholds near the rotated surface code's numerically established coherence threshold. Furthermore, using a Majorana mode-based simulator, we use random families of compass codes to smoothly interpolate between the Z-Shor codes and the X-Shor codes.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's demon across the quantum-to-classical transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scenarios coined Maxwell's demon, information on microscopic degrees of freedom is used to seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. This has been studied in the classical as well as the quantum domain. In this paper, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon that can operate in both domains. In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot, and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system. We anticipate similar behaviors in other quantum systems under continuous measurement and feedback control, making our results relevant for implementations in quantum technology and quantum control.</description>

      <title>Strategic Data Re-Uploads: A Pathway to Improved Quantum Classification Data Re-Uploading Strategies for Improved Quantum Classifier Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising field that explores the applications of quantum computing to machine learning tasks. A significant hurdle in the advancement of quantum machine learning lies in the development of efficient and resilient quantum classifiers capable of accurately mapping input data to specific, discrete target outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve quantum classifier performance by using a data re-uploading strategy. Re-uploading classical information into quantum states multiple times can enhance the accuracy of quantum classifiers. We investigate the effects of different cost functions, such as fidelity and trace distance, on the optimization process and the classification results. We demonstrate our approach to two classification patterns: a linear classification pattern (LCP) and a non-linear classification pattern (NLCP). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by benchmarking it against four distinct optimization techniques: L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Nelder-Mead, and SLSQP. Additionally, we study the different impacts of fixed datasets and random datasets. Our results show that our approach can achieve high classification accuracy and robustness and outperform the existing quantum classifier models.</description>

      <title>Scalable Scheduling Policies for Quantum Satellite Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega constellations continue to be deployed for satellite internet and recent successful experiments in satellite-based quantum entanglement distribution emerge, a natural question arises: How should we coordinate transmissions and design scalable scheduling policies for a quantum satellite internet? In this work, we consider the problem of transmission scheduling in quantum satellite networks subject to resource constraints at the satellites and ground stations. We show that the most general problem of assigning satellites to ground station pairs for entanglement distribution is NP-hard. We then propose four heuristic algorithms and evaluate their performance for Starlink mega constellation under various amount of resources and placements of the ground stations. We find that the maximum number of receivers necessary per ground station grows very slowly with the total number of deployed ground stations. Our proposed algorithms, leveraging optimal weighted b-matching and the global greedy heuristic, outperform others in entanglement distribution rate, entanglement fidelity, and handover cost metrics. While we develop these scheduling algorithms, we have also designed a software system to simulate, visualize, and evaluate satellite mega-constellations for entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation to measure global and genuine entanglement in three-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a purely geometric formulation for two different measures addressed to quantify the entanglement between different parts of a tripartite qubit system. Our approach considers the entanglement-polytope defined by the smallest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the qubit-components. The measures identify global and genuine entanglement, and are respectively associated with the projection and rejection of a given point of the polytope on the corresponding biseparable segments. Solving the so called `inverse problem', we also discuss a way to force the system to behave in a particular form, which opens the possibility of controlling and manipulating entanglement for practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Improved classical shadows from local symmetries in the Schur basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of the classical shadows task: what is the fewest number of copies of an unknown state you need to measure to predict expected values with respect to some class of observables? Large joint measurements are likely required in order to minimize sample complexity, but previous joint measurement protocols only work when the unknown state is pure. We present the first joint measurement protocol for classical shadows whose sample complexity scales with the rank of the unknown state. In particular we prove $\mathcal O(\sqrt{rB}/\epsilon^2)$ samples suffice, where $r$ is the rank of the state, $B$ is a bound on the squared Frobenius norm of the observables, and $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy. In the low-rank regime, this is a nearly quadratic advantage over traditional approaches that use single-copy measurements.
  We present several intermediate results that may be of independent interest: a solution to a new formulation of classical shadows that captures functions of non-identical input states; a generalization of a ``nice'' Schur basis used for optimal qubit purification and quantum majority vote; and a measurement strategy that allows us to use local symmetries in the Schur basis to avoid intractable Weingarten calculations in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser writing of depressed cladding waveguides in sapphire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising solution for scalable integrated optics of trapped-ion quantum processors are curved waveguides guiding visible light within sapphire bulk material. To the best of our knowledge, no curved waveguides were investigated in sapphire so far and no waveguides for visible light in undoped planar sapphire substrates were reported. Here, we demonstrate femtosecond laser writing of depressed cladding waveguides in sapphire. Laser parameters such as pulse energy, pulse duration, and repetition rate, as well as waveguide geometry parameters were optimized to guide 728 nm light. This resulted in single-mode waveguides with a propagation loss of 1.9 (3) dB/cm. The investigation of curved waveguides showed a sharp increase in total loss for curvature radii below 15 mm. Our results demonstrate the potential of femtosecond laser writing as a powerful technique for creating integrated optical waveguides in the volume of sapphire substrates. Such waveguides could be a building block for integrated optics in trapped ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>The quantum Mpemba effect in free-fermionic mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel probe to study symmetry breaking, known as entanglement asymmetry, has emerged and has been utilized to explore how symmetry is dynamically restored following quantum quenches. Interestingly, it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, greater initial symmetry breaking leads to faster restoration, akin to a quantum Mpemba effect. This study focuses on investigating the effect of mixed initial states and non-unitary dynamics on symmetry restoration. The mixedness of a state can arise from different sources. We consider dephasing or dissipative processes affecting initial pure states or unitary dynamics of initially thermal states. In the former case, the stationary state after the quench is independent of the initial configuration, resembling the phenomenology of the classical Mpemba effect. Investigating the XY spin chain model, through a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we identify the conditions for the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. It turns out that this phenomenon still occurs in the presence of dissipation or at finite temperature, even though it will be eventually suppressed as the state becomes more mixed.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum master equations can improve the accuracy of semiclassical predictions of multitime correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multitime quantum correlation functions are central objects in physical science, offering a direct link between experimental observables and the dynamics of an underlying model. While experiments such as 2D spectroscopy and quantum control can now measure such quantities, the accurate simulation of such responses remains computationally expensive and sometimes impossible, depending on the system's complexity. A natural tool to employ is the generalized quantum master equation (GQME), which can offer computational savings by extending reference dynamics at a comparatively trivial cost. However, dynamical methods that can tackle chemical systems with atomistic resolution, such as those in the semiclassical hierarchy, often suffer from poor accuracy, limiting the credence one might lend to their results. By combining work on the accuracy-boosting formulation of semiclassical memory kernels with recent work on the multitime GQME, here we show for the first time that one can exploit a multitime semiclassical GQME to dramatically improve both the accuracy of coarse mean-field Ehrenfest dynamics and obtain orders of magnitude efficiency gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary linear constraints into sparse block structures. These tensor networks effectively bridge the gap between U(1) symmetric MPS and traditional, unconstrained MPS. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop canonical forms for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary cost functions subject to linear constraints. We use this to solve the quadratic knapsack problem and show a superior performance against a leading nonlinear integer programming solver, highlighting the potential of our method in tackling complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement of a segment of length $\ell$ in an XXZ chain with one free extremity and the other connected to the rest of the system with a weak bond. We find that the von-Neumann entropy exhibits terms of order $O(1)$ with strong parity effects, that probe the physics associated with the weakened bond and its behavior under the RG (Kane Fisher problem). In contrast with the XX case studied previously the entropy difference $\delta S\equiv S^e-S^o$ gives rise now to a "resonance" curve which depends on the product $\ell T_B$, with $1/T_B$ a characteristic length scale akin to the Kondo length in Kondo problems. The problem is studied both numerically using DMRG and analytically near the healed and split fixed points. Interestingly - and in contrast with what happens in other impurity problems- $\delta S$ can, at least at lowest order, be tackled by conformal perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel interferometric technique to measure small angular and lateral displacements of an optical beam. The technique relies on the metrological performance of the Hermite-Gaussian $HG_{m,0}$ spatial modes. We report an improvement factor of $41$ in the signal-to-noise ratio, as compared to the Gaussian mode, using modes as high as $m=20$. This considerably enhances the sensitivity of such measurements and attests its efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we theoretically develop and experimentally demonstrate a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase shift of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. Experimentally, we image a sparse lattice of $^{87}$Rb samples on the D2 line, to resolve their axial positions with micrometer precision, and to retrieve their complex-valued spectroscopic images. With the phase-angle readouts that are highly insensitive to atom-number and interaction-strength uncertainties, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot-resolution to the transition frequency with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate 3D sensing of local light shift with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Testing and Debugging Quantum Programs: The Road to 2030</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Computing has existed in the theoretical realm for several decades. Recently, given the latest developments in hardware, quantum computing has re-emerged as a promising technology with the potential to solve problems that a classical computer could take hundreds of years to solve. With the rising interest in the field, there are challenges and opportunities for academics and practitioners in terms of software engineering practices, particularly in testing and debugging quantum programs. This paper presents a roadmap for addressing these challenges, pointing out the existing gaps in the literature and suggesting research directions. We present the current state-of-the-art testing and debugging strategies, including classical techniques applied to quantum programs, the development and implementation of quantum-specific assertions, and the identification and classification of bug patterns unique to quantum computing. Additionally, we introduce a conceptual model to illustrate the main concepts regarding the testing and debugging of quantum programs as well as the relationship between them. Those concepts are then used to identify and discuss the main research challenges to cope with quantum programs through 2030, focusing on the interfaces between classical and quantum computing and on creating testing and debugging techniques that take advantage of the unique quantum computing characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency combs, specialized laser sources emitting multiple equidistant frequency lines, have revolutionized science and technology with unprecedented precision and versatility. Recently, integrated frequency combs are emerging as scalable solutions for on-chip photonics. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated superconducting microcomb that is easy to manufacture, simple to operate, and consumes ultra-low power. Our turnkey apparatus comprises a basic nonlinear superconducting device, a Josephson junction, directly coupled to a superconducting microstrip resonator. We showcase coherent comb generation through self-started mode-locking. Therefore, comb emission is initiated solely by activating a DC bias source, with power consumption as low as tens of picowatts. The resulting comb spectrum resides in the microwave domain and spans multiple octaves. The linewidths of all comb lines can be narrowed down to 1 Hz through a unique coherent injection-locking technique. Our work represents a critical step towards fully integrated microwave photonics and offers the potential for integrated quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Spin Symmetry in Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For electronic systems with multi-reference (MR) character, Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with the conventional exchange-correlation (xc) energy functionals can lead to incorrect spin densities and related properties. For example, for H2 dissociation, the spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted solutions obtained with the same xc energy functional in KS-DFT can be distinctly different, yielding the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking effects in the spin-unrestricted solutions. Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) has been shown to resolve the aforementioned spin-symmetry breaking, when the fictitious temperature is properly chosen. In this work, a response theory based on TAO-DFT is developed to demonstrate that TAO-DFT with a sufficiently large fictitious temperature can always resolve the unphysical spin-symmetry breaking in MR systems. To further support this, TAO-DFT calculations with various fictitious temperatures are performed for the dissociation of H2, N2, He2, and Ne2 as well as the twisted ethylene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Future Circular Collider (FCC) -- in its first incarnation as a lepton collider -- will produce, according to the proposed design, more than 100 billion pairs of $\tau$ leptons after working for four years at the energy of the $Z$-boson resonance. The $\tau$ lepton is special because its relatively long lifetime makes it possible to reconstruct the momenta of neutrinos emitted in the single pion decay mode. The resulting large number of events is an ideal source for a full quantum tomography of the process that will test quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequality with unprecedented precision. In addition, the study of polarizations and spin correlations can provide a competitive determination of the Weinberg angle $ \theta_W$ and constrain possible anomalous couplings in the neutral electroweak current. We utilize analytic results and Monte Carlo simulations to explore to what extent these goals might be accomplished.</description>

Abstract: Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) or Matrix Product States (MPS) are widely acknowledged as highly effective and accurate methods for solving one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, the direct application of DMRG to the study two-dimensional systems encounters challenges due to the limited entanglement encoded in the wave-function ansatz. Conversely, Clifford circuits offer a promising avenue for simulating states with substantial entanglement, albeit confined to stabilizer states. In this work, we present the seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, leveraging the advantages of both Clifford circuits and DMRG. This integration leads to a significant enhancement in simulation accuracy with small additional computational cost. Moreover, this framework is useful not only for its current application but also for its potential to be easily adapted to various other numerical approaches</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic order typically emerges due to the short-range exchange interaction between the constituent electronic spins. Recent discoveries have found a crucial role for spin-phonon coupling in various phenomena from optical ultrafast magnetization switching to dynamical control of the magnetic state. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the emergence of a biquadratic long-range interaction between spins mediated by their coupling to phonons hybridized with vacuum photons into polaritons. The resulting ordered state enabled by the exchange of virtual polaritons between spins is reminiscent of superconductivity mediated by the exchange of virtual phonons. The biquadratic nature of the spin-spin interaction promotes ordering without favoring ferro- or antiferromagnetism. It further makes the phase transition to magnetic order a first-order transition, unlike in conventional magnets. Consequently, a large magnetization develops abruptly on lowering the temperature which \aknew{could} enable magnetic memories admitting ultralow-power thermally-assisted writing while maintaining a high data stability. The role of photons in the phenomenon further enables an in-situ static control over the magnetism. These unique features make our predicted spin-spin interaction and magnetism highly unconventional paving the way for novel scientific and technological opportunities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of quantum droplets at finite temperature in attractive Bose mixtures subject to a strong transverse harmonic confinement. By means of exact path-integral Monte Carlo methods we determine the equilibrium density of the gas and the liquid as well as the pressure vs. volume dependence along isothermal curves. Results for the equation of state and for the gas-liquid coexistence region in quasi-2D configurations are compared with calculations in strictly two dimensions, finding excellent agreement. Within the pure 2D model we explore the relevance of the quantum scale anomaly and we determine the critical interaction strength for the occurrence of the first-order gas to liquid transition. Furthermore, we find that the superfluid response develops suddenly, following the density jump from the gas to the liquid state.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dynamics of charged scalar bosons in a Bonnor-Melvin-$\Lambda$ universe is considered. In this study, the behavior of charged scalar bosons is explored within the framework of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism. Adopting a conical approximation ($\Lambda\ll 1$), we are considered two scenarios for the vector potential: a linear and quadratic vector potentials. In particular, the effects of this background in the equation of motion, phase shift, $S$-matrix, energy spectrum and DKP spinor are analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Driven Breakdown of Electronic Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-thermal breakdown of a Mott insulator has been a topic of great theoretical and experimental interest with technological relevance. Recent experiments have found a sharp non-equilibrium insulator-to-metal transition that is accompanied by hysteresis, a negative differential conductance and lattice deformations. However, a thorough understanding of the underlying breakdown mechanism is still lacking. Here, we examine a scenario in which the breakdown is induced by chemical pressure in a paradigmatic model of interacting spinless fermions on a chain coupled to metallic reservoirs (leads). For the Markovian regime, at infinite bias, we qualitatively reproduce several established results. Beyond infinite bias, we find a rich phase diagram where the nature of the breakdown depends on the coupling strength as the bias voltage is tuned up, yielding different current-carrying non-equilibrium phases. For weak to intermediate coupling, we find a conducting CDW phase with a bias-dependent ordering wave vector. At large interaction strength, the breakdown connects the system to a charge-separated insulating phase. We find instances of hysteretic behavior, sharp current onset and negative differential conductance. Our results can help to shed light on recent experimental findings that address current-induced Mott breakdown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a gas behave like a crystal? Supersolidity is an intriguing and challenging state of matter which combines key features of superfluids and crystals. Predicted a long time ago, its experimental realization has been recently achieved in Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) atomic gases inside optical resonators, spin-orbit coupled BEC's and atomic gases interacting with long range dipolar forces. The activity on dipolar gases has been particularly vibrant in the last few years. This perspective article summarizes the main experimental and theoretical achievements concerning supersolidity in the field of dipolar gases, like the observation of the density modulations caused by the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance, the effects of coherence and the occurrence of novel Goldstone modes. A series of important issues for the future experimental and theoretical research are outlined including, among others, the possible realization of quantized vortices inside these novel crystal structure, the role of dimensionality, the characterisation of the crystal properties and the nature of the phase transitions.
  At the end a brief overview on some other (mainly cold atomic) platforms, where supersolidity has been observed or where supersolidty is expected to emerge is provided.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we derive from simple and reasonable assumptions a Gaussian noise model for quantum amplitude estimation. We provide results from quantum amplitude estimation run on various IBM superconducting quantum computers and Quantinuum's H1 trapped-ion quantum computer to show that the proposed model is a good fit for real-world experimental data. We also show that the proposed Gaussian noise model can be easily composed with other noise models in order to capture effects that are not well described by Gaussian noise. We then give a generalised procedure for how to embed this noise model into any quantum-phase-estimation-free QAE algorithm, such that the amplitude estimation is ``noise aware''.</description>

Abstract: Randomly diffusing atoms confined in a dissipative optical lattice are illuminated by a weak probe of light. The probe transmission spectrum reveals directed atomic propagation that occurs perpendicular to the direction of probe beam propagation. Resonant enhancement of this directed propagation is observed as we vary the random photon scattering rate. We experimentally characterize this stochastic resonance as a function of probe intensity and lattice well depth. A simple model reveals how the probe-excited atomic density waves and optical pumping rates conspire to create directed atomic propagation within a randomly diffusing sample.</description>

      <title>Identifying the value of a random variable unambiguously: Quantum versus classical approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resources may provide advantage over their classical counterparts. Theoretically, in certain tasks, this advantage can be very high. In this work, we construct such a task based on a game, mediated by Referee and played between Alice and Bob. Referee sends Alice a value of a random variable. At the same time, Referee also sends Bob some partial information regarding that value. Here partial information can be defined in the following way. Bob gets the information of a random set which must contain the value of the variable, that is sent to Alice by the Referee, along with other value(s). Alice is not allowed to know what information is sent to Bob by the Referee. Again, Bob does not know which value of the random variable is sent to Alice. Now, the game can be won if and only if Bob can unambiguously identify the value of the variable, that is sent to Alice, with some nonzero probability, no matter what information Bob receives or which value is sent to Alice. However, to help Bob, Alice sends some limited amount of information to him, based on any strategy which is fixed by Alice and Bob before the game begins. We show that if Alice sends limited amount of classical information then the game cannot be won while the quantum analogue of the `limited amount of classical information' is sufficient for winning the game. Thus, it establishes quantum advantage. We further analyze several variants of the game and provide certain bounds on the success probabilities. Moreover, we establish connections between trine ensemble, mutually unbiased bases, and the encoding-decoding strategies of those variants. We also discuss the role of quantum coherence in the present context.</description>

Abstract: Reliable randomness is a core ingredient in algorithms and applications ranging from numerical simulations to statistical sampling and cryptography. The outcomes of measurements on entangled quantum states can violate Bell inequalities, thus guaranteeing their intrinsic randomness. This constitutes the basis for certified randomness generation. However, this certification requires spacelike separated devices, making it unfit for a compact apparatus. Here we provide a general method for certified randomness generation on a small-scale application-ready device and perform an integrated photonic demonstration combining a solid-state emitter and a glass chip. In contrast to most existing certification protocols, which in the absence of spacelike separation are vulnerable to loopholes inherent to realistic devices, the protocol we implement accounts for information leakage and is thus compatible with emerging compact scalable devices. We demonstrate a 2-qubit photonic device that achieves the highest standard in randomness yet is cut out for real-world applications. The full 94.5-hour-long stabilized process harnesses a bright and stable single-photon quantum-dot based source, feeding into a reconfigurable photonic chip, with stability in the milliradian range on the implemented phases and consistent indistinguishability of the entangled photons above 93%. Using the contextuality framework, we certify private randomness generation and achieve a rate compatible with randomness expansion secure against quantum adversaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catalysis plays a key role in many scientific areas, most notably in chemistry and biology. Here we present a catalytic process in a paradigmatic quantum optics setup, namely the Jaynes-Cummings model, where an atom interacts with an optical cavity. The atom plays the role of the catalyst, and allows for the deterministic generation of non-classical light in the cavity. Considering a cavity prepared in a ``classical'' coherent state, and choosing appropriately the atomic state and the interaction time, we obtain an evolution with the following properties. First, the state of the cavity has been modified, and now features non-classicality, as witnessed by sub-Poissonian statistics or Wigner negativity. Second, the process is catalytic, in the sense that the atom is deterministically returned to its initial state exactly, and can be re-used multiple times. What is more, we also show that our findings are robust under dissipation and can be applied to scenarios featuring cavity loss and atomic decay. Finally, we investigate the mechanism of this catalytic process, in particular highlighting the key role of correlations and quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of dissipation for Maxwell equations in dispersive media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dispersive media, dissipation appears in the Schr\"odinger representation of classical Maxwell equations as a sparse diagonal operator occupying an $r$-dimensional subspace. A first order Suzuki-Trotter approximation for the evolution operator enables us to isolate the non-unitary operators (associated with dissipation) from the unitary operators (associated with lossless media). The unitary operators can be implemented through qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) on $n$ qubits. However, the non-unitary-dissipative part poses a challenge on how it should be implemented on a quantum computer. In this paper, two probabilistic dilation algorithms are considered for handling the dissipative operators. The first algorithm is based on treating the classical dissipation as a linear amplitude damping-type completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum channel where the combined system-environment must undergo unitary evolution in the dilated space. The unspecified environment can be modeled by just one ancillary qubit, resulting in an implementation scaling of $\textit{O}(2^{n-1}n^2)$ elementary gates for the dilated unitary evolution operator. The second algorithm approximates the non-unitary operators by the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU). We obtain an optimized representation of the non-unitary part, which requires $\textit{O}(2^{n})$ elementary gates. Applying the LCU method for a simple dielectric medium with homogeneous dissipation rate, the implementation scaling can be further reduced into $\textit{O}[poly(n)]$ basic gates. For the particular case of weak dissipation we show that our proposed post-selective dilation algorithms can efficiently delve into the transient evolution dynamics of dissipative systems by calculating the respective implementation circuit depth. A connection of our results with the non-linear-in-normalization-only (NINO) quantum channels is also presented.</description>

      <title>Refrigeration by modified Otto cycles and modified swaps through generalized measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two types of thermodynamic refrigeration cycles obtained through modification of the Otto cycle refrigerator by a generalized measurement channel. These refrigerators are corresponding to the activation of the measurement-based stroke before (first type) and after (second type) the full thermalization of the cooling medium by the cold reservoir in the related familiar Otto cycle. We show that the coefficient of performance for the first type modified refrigerator increases linearly in terms of measurement strength parameter, beyond the classical cooling of the known Otto cycle refrigerator. The second type interestingly introduces another autonomous refrigerator whose supplying work is provided by a quantum engine induced by the measurement channel along the modified cycle. By the considered measurement channel, we also establish such modifications on the swap refrigerator. It is observed that the thermodynamic properties of the obtained modified swap refrigerators are the same as of the modified Otto cycle ones respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atoms confined in a three-dimensional dissipative optical lattice oscillate inside potential wells, occasionally hopping to adjacent wells, thereby diffusing in all directions. Illumination by a weak probe beam modulates the lattice, yielding propagating atomic density waves, referred to as Brillouin modes which travel perpendicular to the direction of travel of the probe. The probe is made incident at a small angle relative to a lattice symmetry axis, yielding a driving potential perturbation whose spatial period is not a multiple of the period of the underlying optical potential, thus enabling exploration of the regime of space quasiperiodic drive. A theory, based on the Fourier decomposition of the current into its atomic density wave contributions, reveals that unlike the previously studied time quasiperiodic case, wherein a lattice driven by two incommensurate frequencies may exhibit abrupt suppression in directed current as the driving transitions from quasiperiodic to periodic, a spatial-quasiperiodically driven lattice exhibits no such abrupt response. Further, detailed modeling of spatial-quasiperiodically driven lattices reveals that directed propagation occurs not only as a consequence of velocity-matching between the propagating modulation and the average velocity of the atom oscillating inside a well as was previously reported in the literature, but also as a distinct consequence of a new mechanism, namely, frequency-matching between the modulation frequency and the oscillation frequencies. A systematic measurement of the transmitted probe spectra as a function of off-axis probe angle is presented, which is consistent with the velocity- and frequency-matching predictions from the detailed model.</description>

      <title>Retrieving non-linear features from noisy quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately estimating high-order moments of quantum states is an elementary precondition for many crucial tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, entropy estimation, spectrum estimation, and predicting non-linear features from quantum states. But in reality, inevitable quantum noise prevents us from accessing the desired value. In this paper, we address this issue by systematically analyzing the feasibility and efficiency of extracting high-order moments from noisy states. We first show that there exists a quantum protocol capable of accomplishing this task if and only if the underlying noise channel is invertible. We then establish a method for deriving protocols that attain optimal sample complexity using quantum operations and classical post-processing only. Our protocols, in contrast to conventional ones, incur lower overheads and avoid sampling different quantum operations due to a novel technique called observable shift, making the protocols strong candidates for practical usage on current quantum devices. The proposed method also indicates the power of entangled protocols in retrieving high-order information, whereas in the existing methods, entanglement does not help. We further construct the protocol for large quantum systems to retrieve the depolarizing channels, making the proposed method scalable. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of how quantum noise could affect high-order information extraction and provides guidance on how to tackle it.</description>

      <title>The Bethe Ansatz as a Quantum Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bethe ansatz represents an analytical method enabling the exact solution of numerous models in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. When a global symmetry is present, the trial wavefunctions of the Bethe ansatz consist of plane wave superpositions. Previously, it has been shown that the Bethe ansatz can be recast as a deterministic quantum circuit. An analytical derivation of the quantum gates that form the circuit was lacking however. Here we present a comprehensive study of the transformation that brings the Bethe ansatz into a quantum circuit, which leads us to determine the analytical expression of the circuit gates. As a crucial step of the derivation, we present a simple set of diagrammatic rules that define a novel Matrix Product State network building Bethe wavefunctions. Remarkably, this provides a new perspective on the equivalence between the coordinate and algebraic versions of the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Continuous variable quantum computation of the $O(3)$ model in 1+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model in 1+1 dimensions as a limit of a three-component scalar field theory restricted to the unit sphere in the large squeezing limit. This allows us to describe the model in terms of the continuous variable (CV) approach to quantum computing. We construct the ground state and excited states using the coupled-cluster Ansatz and find excellent agreement with the exact diagonalization results for a small number of lattice sites. We then present the simulation protocol for the time evolution of the model using CV gates and obtain numerical results using a photonic quantum simulator. We expect that the methods developed in this work will be useful for exploring interesting dynamics for a wide class of sigma models and gauge theories, as well as for simulating scattering events on quantum hardware in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Tight inequalities for nonclassicality of measurement statistics</title>

Abstract: In quantum optics, measurement statistics -- for example, photocounting statistics -- are considered nonclassical if they cannot be reproduced with statistical mixtures of classical radiation fields. We have formulated a necessary and sufficient condition for such nonclassicality. This condition is given by a set of inequalities that tightly bound the convex set of probabilities associated with classical electromagnetic radiation. Analytical forms for full sets and subsets of these inequalities are obtained for important cases of realistic photocounting measurements and unbalanced homodyne detection. As an example, we consider photocounting statistics of phase-squeezed coherent states. Contrary to a common intuition, the analysis developed here reveals distinct nonclassical properties of these statistics that can be experimentally corroborated with minimal resources.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nonlocality: Multi-copy Resource Inter-convertibility &amp; Their Asymptotic Inequivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality, pioneered in Bell's seminal work and subsequently verified through a series of experiments, has drawn substantial attention due to its practical applications in various protocols. Evaluating and comparing the extent of nonlocality within distinct quantum correlations holds significant practical relevance. Within the resource theoretic framework this can be achieved by assessing the inter-conversion rate among different nonlocal correlations under free local operations and shared randomness. In this study we, however, present instances of quantum nonlocal correlations that are incomparable in the strongest sense. Specifically, when starting with an arbitrary many copies of one nonlocal correlation, it becomes impossible to obtain even a single copy of the other correlation, and this incomparability holds in both directions. Remarkably, these incomparable quantum correlations can be obtained even in the simplest Bell scenario, which involves two parties, each having two dichotomic measurements setups. Notably, there exist an uncountable number of such incomparable correlations. Our result challenges the notion of a 'unique gold coin', often referred to as the 'maximally resourceful state', within the framework of the resource theory of quantum nonlocality, which has nontrivial implications in the study of nonlocality distillation.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

Abstract: We study a Grover-type method for Quadratic Binary Optimization problems. In the unconstrained (QUBO) case, for an $n$-dimensional problem with $m$ nonzero terms, we construct a marker oracle for such problems with a tuneable parameter, $\Lambda \in \left[ 1, m \right] \cap \mathbb{Z}$. At $d \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ precision, the oracle uses $O \left( n + \Lambda d \right)$ qubits, has total depth $O \left( \tfrac{m}{\Lambda} \log_2 \left( n \right) + \log_2 \left( d \right) \right)$, and non-Clifford depth of $O \left( \tfrac{m}{\Lambda} \right)$. Moreover, each qubit required to be connected to at most $O \left( \log_2 \left( \Lambda + d \right) \right)$ other qubits. In the case of a maximal graph cuts, as $d = 2 \log_2 \left( n \right)$ always suffices, the depth of the marker oracle can be made as shallow as $O \left( \log_2 \left( n \right) \right)$. For all values of $\Lambda$, the non-Clifford gate count of these oracles is strictly lower (by a factor of $\sim 2$) than previous constructions [5].
  We then introduce a novel \emph{Fixed-point Grover Adaptive Search for QUBO Problems}, using our oracle design and a hybrid Fixed-point Grover Search of Li et al. [9]. This method has better performance guarantees than the Grover Adaptive Search of Gilliam et al. [5]. Finally, we give a heuristic argument that, with high probability and in $O \left( \tfrac{\log_2 \left( n \right)}{\sqrt{\epsilon}} \right)$ time, this adaptive method finds a configuration that is among the best $\epsilon 2^n$ ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies the breaking of the Lorentz symmetry at the Planck length in quantum mechanics. We use three-dimensional p-adic vectors as position variables, while the time remains a real number. In this setting, the Planck length is 1/p, where p is a prime number, and the Lorentz symmetry is naturally broken. In the framework of the Dirac-von Neumann formalism for quantum mechanics, we introduce a new p-adic Dirac equation that predicts the existence of particles and antiparticles and charge conjugation like the standard one. The discreteness of the p-adic space imposes substantial restrictions on the solutions of the new equation. This equation admits localized solutions, which is impossible in the standard case. We show that an isolated quantum system whose evolution is controlled by the p-adic Dirac equation does not satisfy the Einstein causality, which means that the speed of light is not the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter or energy can travel through space. The new p-adic Dirac equation is not intended to replace the standard one; it should be understood as a new version (or a limit) of the classical equation at the Planck length scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study single-photon scattering spectra of a giant atom chirally coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide at multiple connection points, and examine chirality induced effects in the scattering spectra. We show that the transmission spectra typically possess an anti-Lorentzian lineshape with a nonzero minimum, but by engineering the chirality of the multi-point coupling, the transmission spectrum of an incident photon can undergo a transition from complete transmission to total reflection at multiple frequency ``windows'', where the width of the anti-Lorentzian lineshape for each of the window can be flexibly tuned at a fixed frequency detuning. Moreover, we show that a perfect nonreciprocal photon scattering can be achieved due to the interplay between internal atomic spontaneous emission and the chirally external decay to the waveguide, in contrast to that induced by the non-Markovian retardation effect. We also consider the non-Markovian retardation effect on the scattering spectra, which allows for a photonic band gap even with only two chiral coupling points. The giant-atom-waveguide system with chiral coupling is a promising candidate for realizing single-photon routers with multiple channels.</description>

Abstract: We implement a simulation of a quantum field theory in 1+1 space-time dimensions on a gate-based quantum computer using the light front formulation of the theory. The nonperturbative simulation of the Yukawa model field theory is verified on IBM's simulator and is also demonstrated on a small-scale IBM circuit-based quantum processor, on the cloud, using IBM Qiskit. The light front formulation allows for controlling the resource requirement and complexity of the computation with commensurate trade-offs in accuracy and detail by modulating a single parameter, namely the harmonic resolution. Qubit operators for the bosonic excitations were also created and were used along with the fermionic ones already available, to simulate the theory involving all of these particles. With the restriction on the number of logical qubits available on the existent gate-based Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, the trotterization approximation is also used. We show that experimentally relevant quantities like cross-sections for various processes, survival probabilities of various states, etc. can be computed. We also explore the inaccuracies introduced by the bounds on achievable harmonic resolution and Trotter steps placed by the limited number of qubits and circuit depth supported by present-day NISQ devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) aims at reconstructing the state of a quantum system. However in conventional QST the number of measurements scales exponentially with the number of qubits. Here we propose a QST protocol, in which the introduction of a threshold allows one to drastically reduce the number of measurements required for the reconstruction of the state density matrix without compromising the result accuracy. In addition, one can also use the same approach to reconstruct an approximated density matrix depending on the available resources. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol by performing the tomography of states up to 7 qubits. We show that our approach can lead to the same accuracy of QST even when the number of measurements is reduced by more than two orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The rates of transitions between states of the system, that characterize the process, are found by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Further, we search for time dependence of mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that under made assumptions it is governed by Boltzmann collision integral. In this theory, the non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus we present the possible solution for the famous time-arrow problem.</description>

Abstract: This article shows a proof of concept regarding the feasibility of ab initio molecular simulation, wherein the wavefunctions and the positions of nuclei are simultaneously determined by the quantum algorithm, as is realized by the so-called Car-Parrinello method by classical computing. The approach used in this article is of a hybrid style, which shall be realized by future fault-tolerant quantum computer. First, the basic equations are approximated by polynomials. Second, those polynomials are transformed to a specific form, wherein all variables (representing the wavefunctions and the atomic coordinates) are given by the transformations acting on a linear space of monomials with finite dimension, and the unknown variables could be determined as the eigenvalues of those transformation matrices. Third, the eigenvalues are determined by quantum phase estimation. Following these three steps, namely, symbolic, numeric, and quantum steps, we can determine the optimized electronic and atomic structures of molecules.</description>

Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide is a promising method for mitigating climate change. Solid sorbents, such as metal-organic frameworks, are currently being tested for DAC application. However, their potential for deployment at scale has not been fully realized. The computational discovery of solid sorbents is challenging, given the vast chemical search space and the DAC requirements for molecular selectivity. Quantum computing can potentially accelerate the discovery of solid sorbents for DAC by predicting molecular binding energies. In this work, we explore simulation methods and algorithms for predicting gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks using a quantum computer. Specifically, we simulate the potential energy surfaces of CO2, N2, and H2O molecules at the Mg+2 metal center that represents the binding sites of typical metal-organic frameworks. We apply the qubit-ADAPT-VQE technique to run simulations on both classical computing and quantum computing hardware, and achieve reasonable accuracy while maintaining hardware efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Quantum control techniques play an important role in manipulating and harnessing the properties of different quantum systems, including isolated atoms. Here, we propose to achieve quantum control over a single on-surface atomic spin using Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry implemented with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Specifically, we model how the application of time-dependent, non-resonant AC electric fields across the STM tip-surface gap makes it possible to achieve precise quantum state manipulation in an isolated Fe atom on a MgO/Ag(100) surface. We propose a protocol to combine Landau Zener tunneling with LZSM interferometry that permits one to measure the quantum spin tunneling of an individual Fe atom. The proposed experiments can be implemented with ESR-STM instrumentation, opening a new venue in the research of on-surface single spin control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical networks are the leading platform for the transfer of information due to their low loss and ability to scale to many information channels using optical frequency modes. To fully leverage the quantum properties of light in this platform, it is desired to manipulate higher-dimensional superpositions by orchestrating linear, beamsplitter-type interactions between several channels simultaneously. We propose a method of achieving simultaneous, all-to-all coupling between N optical frequency modes via N-way Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing. By exploiting the frequency degree of freedom, additional modes can be multiplexed in an interaction medium of fixed volume and loss, avoiding the introduction of excess noise. We generalize the theory of the frequency-encoded two-mode interaction to N modes under this four-wave mixing approach and experimentally verify the quantum nature of this scheme by demonstrating three-way multiphoton interference. The two input photons are shared among three frequency modes and display interference differing from that of two classical (coherent-state) inputs. These results show the potential of our approach for the scalability of photonic quantum information processing to general N-mode systems in the frequency domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are vital for protecting quantum computers from noise by encoding quantum information redundantly in physical qubits. However, dynamic defects pose a significant challenge, potentially rendering physical qubits faulty during computation across various quantum platforms. Current defect mitigation strategies focus on surface codes, but often fail to fully restore QEC capability or disrupt logical operations. In our paper, we introduce FlexiSCD, a code deformation framework that integrates adaptive defect mitigation into surface code workflows. It strategically crafts basic deformation instructions based on gauge transformations, enabling optimized processes tailored to specific defects, restoring QEC capability efficiently with fewer qubit resources. We also design an adaptive code layout for efficient logical operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlexiSCD reduces failure rates by $35\times\sim70\times$ and requires only half the qubit resources compared to previous methods. It surpasses previous defect removal techniques, preserving QEC capability and improving surface code communication.</description>

Abstract: Due to the weakness of gravitational coupling, all quantum experiments up to date in which gravity plays a role utilized the field of the Earth. Since this field undergoes practically undetectable back-action from quantum particles, it effectively admits a classical description as a fixed background Newtonian field or spacetime. This argument strongly motivates theoretical and experimental research towards a demonstration of gravitation between two quantum masses, as this is one of the most straightforward scenarios where quantum features of gravity could be observed. Several proposals studied the possibility of generating entanglement between two massive objects. Along the same lines, with a particular focus on gravity, this thesis introduces general tools to tackle interaction-mediated entanglement and applies them to two particles prepared in continuous-variable states.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring data privacy in machine learning models is critical, particularly in distributed settings where model gradients are typically shared among multiple parties to allow collaborative learning. Motivated by the increasing success of recovering input data from the gradients of classical models, this study addresses a central question: How hard is it to recover the input data from the gradients of quantum machine learning models? Focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQC) as learning models, we uncover the crucial role played by the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) of the VQC ansatz in determining privacy vulnerabilities. While the DLA has previously been linked to the classical simulatability and trainability of VQC models, this work, for the first time, establishes its connection to the privacy of VQC models. In particular, we show that properties conducive to the trainability of VQCs, such as a polynomial-sized DLA, also facilitate the extraction of detailed snapshots of the input. We term this a weak privacy breach, as the snapshots enable training VQC models for distinct learning tasks without direct access to the original input. Further, we investigate the conditions for a strong privacy breach where the original input data can be recovered from these snapshots by classical or quantum-assisted polynomial time methods. We establish conditions on the encoding map such as classical simulatability, overlap with DLA basis, and its Fourier frequency characteristics that enable such a privacy breach of VQC models. Our findings thus play a crucial role in detailing the prospects of quantum privacy advantage by guiding the requirements for designing quantum machine learning models that balance trainability with robust privacy protection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe Qiskit, a software development kit for quantum information science. We discuss the key design decisions that have shaped its development, and examine the software architecture and its core components. We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for solving a problem in condensed matter physics on a quantum computer that serves to highlight some of Qiskit's capabilities, for example the representation and optimization of circuits at various abstraction levels, its scalability and retargetability to new gates, and the use of quantum-classical computations via dynamic circuits. Lastly, we discuss some of the ecosystem of tools and plugins that extend Qiskit for various tasks, and the future ahead.</description>

      <title>Producing slow light in warm alkali vapor using electromagnetically induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.09229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present undergraduate-friendly instructions on how to produce light pulses propagating through warm Rubidium vapor with speeds less than 400 m/s, i.e., nearly a million times slower than c. We elucidate the role played by electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in producing slow light pulses, and discuss how to achieve the required experimental conditions. The optical set up is presented, and details provided for preparation of pump, probe, and reference pulses of the required size, frequency, intensity, temporal width, and polarization purity. EIT-based slow light pulses provide the most widely studied architecture for creating quantum memories. Therefore, the basic concepts presented here are useful for physics and engineering majors who wish to get involved in the development of cutting-edge quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ashkin-Teller criticality in a constrained boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the expected Ising, universality class. We show that the transitions of the model reproduces the Askhin-Teller critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Detecting Quantum Anomalies in Open Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries and quantum anomalies serve as powerful tools for constraining complicated quantum many-body systems, offering valuable insights into low-energy characteristics based on their ultraviolet structure. Nevertheless, their applicability has traditionally been confined to closed quantum systems, rendering them largely unexplored for open quantum systems described by density matrices. In this work, we introduce a novel and experimentally feasible approach to detect quantum anomalies in open systems. Specifically, we claim that, when coupled with an external environment, the mixed 't Hooft anomaly between spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry gives distinctive characteristics for half-integer and integer spin chains in measurements of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm tot})$ as a function of $\theta$. Notably, the half-integer spin chain manifests a topological phenomenon akin to the ``level crossing" observed in closed systems. To substantiate our assertion, we develop a lattice-level spacetime rotation to analyze the aforementioned measurements. Based on the matrix product density operator and transfer matrix formalism, we analytically establish and numerically demonstrate the unavoidable singular behavior of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm tot})$ for half-integer spin chains. Conceptually, our work demonstrates a way to discuss notions like ``spectral flow'' and ``flux threading'' in open systems not necessarily with a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Rotational-state dependence of interactions between polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Scheme for Deterministic Loading of Laser-Cooled Molecules into Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Interferometric measurement of the deflection of light by light in air</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the DeLLight (Deflection of Light by Light) experiment is to observe for the first time the optical nonlinearity in vacuum, as predicted by Quantum Electrodynamics, by measuring the refraction of a low-intensity focused laser pulse (probe) when crossing the effective vacuum index gradient induced by a high-intensity focused laser pulse (pump). The deflection signal is amplified by using a Sagnac interferometer. Here, we report the first measurement performed with the DeLLight pilot interferometer, of the deflection of light by light in air, with a low-intensity pump. We show that the deflection signal measured by the interferometer is amplified, and is in agreement with the expected signal induced by the optical Kerr effect in air. Moreover, we verify that the signal varies as expected as a function of the pump intensity, the temporal delay between the pump and the probe, and their relative polarisation. These results represent a proof of concept of the DeLLight experimental method based on interferometric amplification.</description>

      <title>Optical Widefield Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopy enables detailed visualization and understanding of minute structures or processes. While cameras have significantly advanced optical, infrared, and electron microscopy, imaging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals on a camera has remained elusive. Here, we employ nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a quantum sensor, which converts NMR signals into optical signals that are subsequently captured by a high-speed camera. Unlike traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), our method records the NMR signal over a wide field of view in real space. We demonstrate that our optical widefield NMR microscopy (OMRM) can image NMR signals in microfluidic structures with a $\sim 10\,\mu m$ resolution across a $\sim 235 \times 150\,\mu m^2$ area. Crucially, each camera pixel records an NMR spectrum providing multicomponent information about the signal's amplitude, phase, local magnetic field strengths, and gradients. The fusion of optical microscopy and NMR techniques enables multifaceted imaging applications in the physical and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Single vibronic level fluorescence spectra from Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence experiments, the electronically excited initial state is also excited in one or several vibrational modes. Whereas computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors individually becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we use Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. In systems where the potential is at most quadratic, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and can be propagated with the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. We validate the method in two-dimensional global harmonic models by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations. Additionally, we study the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the Hagedorn approach to high-dimensional systems on an example of displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Recoil heating of a dielectric particle illuminated by a linearly polarized plane wave within the Rayleigh regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recoil heating phenomenon experienced by a dielectric spherical particle when it interacts with a linearly polarized plane wave within the Rayleigh regime. We derive the fluctuating force acted upon the particle arising from the fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields. Our derivations reveal that the spectral density of the fluctuating force along the propagation direction is $7\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$. Meanwhile, along the direction of the electric and magnetic fields, it is $\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$ and $2\hbar \omega_0 P_{\mathrm{scat}}/5c^2$, respectively. Here, $P_{\mathrm{scat}}$ denotes the power scattered by the particle, $\hbar\omega_0$ represents the energy of a photon, and $c$ is the speed of light. Recoil heating imposes fundamental limitations in levitated optomechanics, constraining the minimum temperatures achievable in cooling processes, the coherence time of the system, and the sensitivity of force measurements.</description>
