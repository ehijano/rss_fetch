      <title>Alcohol additives to enhance ammonia-methane combustion efficiency and reduce emissions: A reactive force field analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the impact of alcohol additives on combustion and pyrolysis of ammonia/methane is of great importance in the pursuit of sustainable energy technologies. This work employs Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the underlying mechanism of how ethanol and methanol additives affect reaction pathways, NOx emissions and bond energy characteristics in ammonia-methane pyrolysis and combustion processes. It shows that adding alcohols altered NOx formation pathways, reducing the diversity of NOx and shifting the equilibrium toward simpler NOx such as NO and NO2. At 2,000 K, alcohol blends, particularly methanol, demonstrated a notable reduction in NO2 formation. At 3,000 K, both ethanol and methanol suppressed NO production, but the influence of methanol was stronger. Nitric acid production, HNO3, was present at lower temperatures but became negligible at higher temperatures because of the thermal breakdown of the higher-order NOx. These trends confirm that alcohol additives realize a probable role in moderating NOx emissions and stabilizing reaction pathways. The pyrolysis in modified reaction pathways, which facilitated the decomposition of ammonia and methane in these blends, affected the formation of intermediate species, leading to the reduction in peak emissions. In addition, methanol and ethanol showed significant impacts on hydrogen bond energies of the mixture, especially important building block radicals encouraging higher complexity pathways. By leveraging a computationally robust and scalable methodology, this study not only advances a fundamental understanding of alcohol-enhanced ammonia/methane combustion but also informs strategies to optimize these mixtures for practical use in modern propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis, and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer, a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</description>

      <title>Compressibility of Confined Fluids from Volume Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their properties deviate from bulk. These include bulk modulus, or compressibility, which determines the mechanical properties of fluid-saturated porous solids. Such properties are of importance for exploration and recovery of coal-bed methane and shale gas. We developed a new molecular simulation method for calculating compressibility of confined fluids, and applied it to methane in carbon nanopores. The method is based on volume fluctuations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, made possible through integrated potentials. Our method is one order of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo approach, and allows calculations for pore sizes up to 100 nm. Our simulations predicted an increase in the fluid bulk modulus by a factor of 4 in 3 nm slit pores, and showed a gradual decrease with the increase of the pore size, so that at 100 nm, the deviation from the bulk is less than 5%.</description>

      <title>Influence of light, temperature, and iron oxidation state on the dissolution rate of combusted iron particles in oxalic acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is essential to control the dissolution rate of iron oxide particles for a prospective acidic iron electrowinning process. In this study, the combined influence of temperature (40-80{\deg}C) and short-wavelength light exposure on the dissolution rate of combusted iron particles in aqueous oxalic acid (0.45 mol/L) is experimentally investigated. The combusted iron particles were produced with various fuel-to-air equivalence ratios during combustion. Unlike previous dissolution studies on single-phase iron oxides, these particles comprise a heterogeneous mixture of iron oxides - primarily hematite and magnetite. In situ video recordings revealed the evolution of the particle size and morphology during dissolution. Increasing the temperature accelerated the reaction rate, and an additional light-induced enhancement became significant only above 40{\deg}C for the duration of the experiments. This behavior differs significantly from that observed for hematite/maghemite mixed oxides and is attributed to the internal hematite and magnetite structure of the combusted iron particles. At 80{\deg}C under short-wavelength light irradiation, a sudden decrease in the reaction rate was observed owing to solid ferrous oxide formation. Although the fuel-to-air ratio affected the iron oxide composition inside the particles, it did not significantly affect the dissolution rate of the combusted iron particles.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model to simulate charge flow through an electrochemical half cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is founded on the benchmarking of theoretical models against experimental measurements, with the challenge that for all but the simplest systems, the calculations required for high precision become extremely challenging. $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is the simplest stable molecule, and its structure is calculable to high precision. However, studying $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant challenges: Standard control methods such as laser cooling are not applicable due to the long lifetimes of its rotational and vibrational states. Here we solve this issue by combining buffer gas cooling to quench the $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ rovibrational excitation with quantum logic operations between $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ and a co-trapped 'helper' ion to control the molecule's hyperfine structure. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control, and non-destructive readout, which we use to demonstrate high-resolution microwave spectroscopy in the hyperfine structure of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ with a precision of 2 Hz. Our results pave the way for high precision spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical domains. Due to the wide applicability of buffer gas cooling, our method provides a general tool for molecular ion species that are hard to control with quantum logic tools alone.</description>

      <title>Tokenization for Molecular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-based foundation models have become an important part of scientific discovery, with molecular foundation models accelerating advancements in material science and molecular design.However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers that capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate 34 tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, and reveal significant gaps in their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by pretraining and finetuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. The proposed tokenizers systematically integrate nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; facilitating applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when increasing the number of qubits in a hydrogen chain shows that the subspace size required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes that cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representations for Chemical Reaction Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that neural networks can be optimized to represent minimum energy paths as continuous functions, offering a flexible alternative to discrete path-search methods such as Nudged Elastic Band (NEB). Our approach parameterizes reaction paths with a network trained on a loss function that discards tangential energy gradients and enables instant estimation of the transition state. We first validate the method on two-dimensional potentials and then demonstrate its advantages over NEB on challenging atomistic systems where (i) poor initial guesses yield unphysical paths, (ii) multiple competing paths exist, or (iii) the reaction follows a complex multi-step mechanism. Results highlight the versatility of the method: for instance, a simple adjustment to the sampling strategy during optimization can help escape local-minimum solutions. Finally, in a low-dimensional setting, we demonstrate that a single neural network can learn from existing paths and generalize to unseen systems, showing promise for a universal reaction path representation.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting, Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03332v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>
