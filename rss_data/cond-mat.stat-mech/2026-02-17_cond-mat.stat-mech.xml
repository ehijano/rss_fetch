      <title>Evolutionary design of thermodynamic logic gates and their heat emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landauer's principle bounds the heat generated by logical operations, but in practice the thermodynamic cost of computation is dominated by the control systems that implement logic. CMOS gates dissipate energy far above the Landauer bound, while laboratory demonstrations of near-Landauer erasure rely on external measurement or feedback systems whose energy costs exceed that of the logic operation by many orders of magnitude. Here we use simulations to show that a genetic algorithm can program a thermodynamic computer to implement logic operations in which the total heat emitted by the control system is of a similar order of magnitude to that of the information-bearing degrees of freedom. Moreover, the computer can be programmed so that heat is drawn away from the information-bearing degrees of freedom and dissipated within the control unit, suggesting the possibility of computing architectures in which heat management is an integral part of the program design.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing the Arrow of Time in mesoscopic: A Unified Framework for Non-equilibrium Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What sustains a non-equilibrium system against fluctuations from within - as witnessed in non-equilibrium steady states, glassy relaxation, and even living organisms? Here we show that the arrow of time itself can be operationalized into a measurable physical quantity on mesoscopic particles - the eigen-phase displacement. This displacement gives rise to a non-local generalized force, the thermodynamic inertia force, which emerges from the integrated contribution of local constraints rather than as a conventional local force. It actively counteracts fluctuations and its algebraic structure is a semi-group, fundamentally distinct from the Lie group of Newton inertia, thereby encoding the irreversibility of time's arrow. Building on this foundation, we construct a unified Microstate-Sequence-Mode-Coupling (MSS-MCT) theory. Its thermodynamic limit is defined by Microstate Sequence (MSS) theory, and its dynamical action is captured by a consequent mode-coupling theory (MCT). From this single first-principles framework, we simultaneously resolve two long-standing puzzles: it predicts the giant non-Gaussian parameter(1~10), closing the order-of-magnitude gap with experiments that standard mode-coupling theory could not explain; and it delivers a first-principles, non-fitting derivation of the universal polymer constant $C_{1} \approx 16.7$ with merely 1 percent error - the most accurate theoretical prediction to date, dramatically surpassing the Adam-Gibbs and others. Our work establishes thermodynamic inertia as a foundational principle for non-equilibrium matter, bridging thermodynamic and dynamic descriptions from glassy relaxation to the maintenance of life.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic Irreversibility in Polytropic Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient manipulation of thermodynamic states within the finite time is fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic dissipative cost. While the slow-driving regime is well-characterized by a universal $1/\tau$-scaling of irreversibility, the physics governing fast, non-adiabatic transitions remains elusive. Here, we propose the polytropic steering protocols that provide an exact analytical bridge between the isothermal and adiabatic limits for Brownian particles far-from-equilibrium. We demonstrate that for any protocol duration $\tau$, the system can be precisely steered along a prescribed polytropic trajectory, revealing a striking non-monotonic dependence of irreversibility on the driving rate. Contrary to the near-equilibrium paradigm where faster driving necessitates higher energetic costs, we identify a most-irreversible timescale, beyond which dissipation is anomalously suppressed by rapid driving. By mapping these protocols onto a broad class of controllable thermodynamic cycle, we establish power-efficiency tradeoffs and position the polytropic index as a genuine thermodynamic control knob for the rational design of high-speed, high-performance microscopic thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems: Toeplitz operators and singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to eigenvalue-based approaches, we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian quadratic lattice Hamiltonians in terms of Toeplitz operators and singular values, which correctly capture the stability, localization, and scaling of edge and corner modes. We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.</description>

      <title>NMR study on equilateral triangular lattice antiferromagnet Ba2La2CoTe2O12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a 139La-NMR study of Ba2La2CoTe2O12, S = 1/2 equilateral triangular-lattice antiferromagnet with easy-plane anisotropy at low temperatures. This compound undergoes a magnetic phase transition at TN = 3.26 K into an ordered state with the 120 degree spin structure. Under magnetic fields above 3T, TN splits into TN1 and TN2, which correspond to the transitions from the paramagnetic phase to the up-up-down (uud) phase and from the uud phase to the triangular coplanar phase, respectively. The NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a critical divergence at TN1, indicating the onset of long-range magnetic order. At TN2, the NMR-linewidth measured at 5.4 T exhibits an anomalous decrease, which we attribute to a change in the spin structure from the uud to the triangular coplanar phase.</description>

      <title>The Sokoban Random Walk: A Trapping Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study caging/trapping in Sokoban-type models, featuring a random walker moving through a disordered medium of obstacles and capable of pushing some obstacles blocking its path. In one-dimension, we allow the walker to push up to an arbitrary $N_{\rm P}$ number of obstacles. For $N_{\rm P}\gg 1$, we use large-deviation theory to show that the survival probability to remain uncaged exhibits crossover from an exponential decay with time at intermediate times to a stretched-exponential decay at long times, with an exponent $1/3$ independent of $N_{\rm P}$. The long-time exponent matches the Balagurov--Vaks--Donsker--Varadhan (BVDV) theory of the classical trapping problem, while the exponential decay is qualitatively distinct from the Rosenstock's intermediate-time theory for classical trapping. Similarly, in two dimensions, numerical simulations reveal that both the Sokoban model and its generalized version exhibit long-time stretched-exponential relaxation with exponent $1/2$, again consistent with the BVDV theory. Finally, in two dimensions, we find that the mean trap size is nonmonotonic in $\rho$: it is small at both low and high densities, but reaches a peak at a characteristic density $\rho_*$. We estimate $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ for the Sokoban model and $\rho_* \approx 0.675$ for the generalized Sokoban model.</description>

      <title>Magnetocardiography measurements using an optically pumped magnetometer under ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report the development of a rubidium-based single-beam scalar optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) and demonstrate its application in measuring human cardiac magnetic fields in an unshielded environment. The developed magnetometers exhibit a noise floor below 15 pT/sqrt(Hz) in the frequency range of 1 to 35 Hz, with a measurement bandwidth of 100 Hz. When operated in a gradiometric configuration, the noise floor is further reduced to below 3 pT/sqrt(Hz) over the same frequency range. Magnetocardiography (MCG) signals were recorded at five different locations across the thorax. A clear polarity reversal of the QRS complex was observed across these measurement positions, confirming the spatial sensitivity of the system. The proposed system shows strong potential for clinical diagnostics, offering valuable physiological information through non-contact MCG measurements</description>

      <title>A self-consistent criterion for the range of validity of weakly driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the longstanding open questions in linear response theory concerns its true range of validity. Determining when the linear approximation can be trusted typically requires knowledge of second-order corrections, which are often difficult to compute explicitly. In this letter, I propose a self-consistent criterion for the validity of linear response, formulated in terms of a typical length scale that emerges from the fluctuation-response inequality within the theory itself. The result applies to classical open systems. I illustrate the criterion with explicit examples of Brownian particles in harmonic traps, and classical open systems presenting Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Finally, I discuss the physical meaning of this typical length, providing both thermodynamic and information-theoretic interpretations.</description>

      <title>The cost of speed: Time-optimal thermal control of trapped Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermal analogue of the classical brachistochrone problem, which minimizes the connection time between two equilibrium states of harmonically confined Brownian particles, has recently been solved theoretically. Here we report its experimental realization using two optically trapped microparticles subjected to a bang-bang effective temperature protocol. Despite their distinct relaxation times, both degrees of freedom are steered to their respective equilibrium states simultaneously in a finite minimal time. We provide a complete time-resolved characterization of the nonequilibrium dynamics through the evolution of the position variances and the entropy production within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, enabling a quantitative comparison with direct relaxation and a suboptimal protocol. In addition, we employ information-geometric tools -- recently referred to as thermal kinematics -- to track the system's path in state space with a single dynamical quantity. Our results show that faster equilibration requires a larger entropy production and an increased thermodynamic length, revealing a direct trade-off between temporal optimality and thermodynamic cost in multidimensional stochastic systems driven by a single intensive control parameter.</description>

      <title>A model of thermophoresis of colloidal proteins in water using non-Fickian diffusion currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1928, Chapman generalised Einstein's theory of diffusion for non-uniform fluids to show the presence of a non-Fickian diffusion current, which he considered important in thermodiffusion (Ludwig-Soret effect). In 1941, Kiyosi It\^o proposed the formal methods of stochastic calculus in the presence of spatially dependent diffusion, yielding the same non-Fickian diffusion current as shown by Chapman. The phenomenon of thermodiffusion and thermophoresis happens in the presence of a temperature gradient, which makes diffusion space-dependent. The role of solvation forces in thermophoresis will only be clearer once that of diffusion is understood properly. In this paper, we investigate the importance of Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current on the thermophoretic motion of colloidal particles in water (with weak salt concentration). We show that all the general features of variations of the Soret coefficient $S_T$ with temperature can be captured using Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current. We compare our theoretical results with experimental plots of the Soret coefficients for three polypeptides in aqueous solution: Lysozyme, BLGA, and Poly-L-Lysine, and find a strong match. We emphasise that, in addition to the yet-to-be-understood details of solvation forces, Chapman's non-Fickian diffusion current is an indispensable element that needs to be taken into account for a complete understanding of thermophoresis and thermodiffusion.</description>

      <title>Strain-rate, temperature and size effects on the mechanical behavior of fiber bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical characteristics of fibers (of various materials), as well as of fiber bundles, are of primary importance for the design and the mechanical behavior of textiles, or of fibrous and composite materials. These characteristics are classically determined from strain-rate controlled tensile testing, generally assuming a negligible role of thermal activation on damage and fracturing processes. Under this assumption, the distribution of individual fiber strengths can be deduced from a downscaling of the macroscopic mechanical behavior at the bundle scale. There are however many experimental evidences of strain-rate and temperature effects on the mechanical behavior of individual fibers or bundles, which can also creep under constant applied load. This indicates a strong role of thermal activation on these processes. Here, these effects are analyzed from a fiber-bundle model with equal-load-sharing, in which thermal activation of fiber breakings is introduced from a kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm adapted for time-varying stresses. This allows to rationalize these rate or temperature effects, such as a decrease of bundle strength, strain at peak stress, and apparent Young's modulus with decreasing strain-rate and/or increasing temperature. This also shows that the classical downscaling procedure used to estimate the distribution of individual fiber strengths from the mechanical behavior at the bundle scale should be considered with caution. If mechanical testing of the bundle is performed under conditions favoring the role of thermal activation (e.g. low applied strain-rate), this procedure can strongly underestimate the intrinsic (athermal) Weibull's parameters of the fiber strengths distribution. The same model is used as well to explore size (number of fibers) effects on bundle mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in quantum spin chains is strictly finite at any temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is the hallmark of quantum physics, yet its characterization in interacting many-body systems at thermal equilibrium remains one of the most important challenges in quantum statistical physics. We prove that the Gibbs state of any quantum spin chain can be exactly decomposed into a mixture of matrix product states with a bond dimension that is independent of the system size, at any finite temperature. As a consequence, the Schmidt number, arguably the most stringent measure of bipartite entanglement, is strictly finite for thermal states, even in the thermodynamic limit. Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal noise stabilizes unbounded diversity in strongly-competitive communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical ecological models predict that large, diverse communities should be unstable, presenting a central challenge to explaining the stable biodiversity seen in nature. We revisit this long-standing problem by extending the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to include both spatial structure and environmental fluctuations across space and time. We find that neither space nor environmental noise alone can resolve the tension between diversity and stability, but that their combined effects permit arbitrarily many species to stably coexist despite strongly disordered competitive interactions. We analytically characterize the noise-induced transition to coexistence, showing that spatiotemporal noise drives an anomalous scaling of abundance fluctuations, known empirically as Taylor's law. At the community level, this manifests as an effective sublinear self-inhibition that renders the community stable and asymptotically neutral in the high-diversity limit. Spatiotemporal noise thus provides a novel resolution to the diversity-stability paradox and a generic mechanism by which complex communities can persist.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic interpretation for interpolation Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams gave a probabilistic interpretation of the Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;1,t)$ at $q=1$ in terms of a Markov chain called the multispecies $t$-Push TASEP, a Markov chain involving particles of types $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ hopping around a ring. In particular, they showed that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$, and the normalizing constant (or partition function) is $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$. There is an inhomogeneous generalization of Macdonald polynomials due to Knop and Sahi called interpolation Macdonald polynomials $P^*_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$, as well as an inhomogeneous generalization of ASEP polynomials called interpolation ASEP polynomials $F^*_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ that we introduced in previous work. In this article we introduce a new Markov chain called the interpolation $t$-Push TASEP, and show that its steady state probabilities and partition function are given by the interpolation ASEP polynomials and the interpolation Macdonald polynomial, evaluated at $q=1$. This generalizes the previous result of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams.</description>

      <title>Ward-Takahashi Identity and Gauge-Invariant Response Theory for Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Ward-Takahashi identity and establish the gauge-invariant response theory for open quantum systems described by Lindbladians to show that particle-number conservation is not necessary to satisfy gauge invariance. We construct an observable which can be used to test the gauge invariance in the absence of particle-number conservation. We derive the low-energy collective modes that emerge as a consequence of gauge invariance in open quantum systems, and find that two-body loss induces diffusive modes in dissipative Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity. Possible experimental situations for testing gauge invariance in open quantum systems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Defect relative entropy in symmetric orbifold CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the defect relative entropy between topological defects in the symmetric product orbifold CFT $\mathrm{Sym}^N(M) = M^{\otimes N}/S_N$. Our analysis covers two distinct classes of defects: universal defects, which realize the $\mathrm{Rep}(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry, and non-universal defects.
  We show that the defect relative entropy reduces to a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. The resulting expression decomposes naturally into two contributions: one governed by characters of the symmetric group $S_N$, and the other controlled by modular $S$-matrix elements of the seed RCFT. Remarkably, both sets of data appear as probability distributions, yielding an information-theoretic interpretation of permutation group data and modular data within the symmetric orbifold.
  The structure of the divergence depends sensitively on the defect class. For universal defects, only the permutation group data contributes; for maximally fractional defects, both permutation and modular data enter and together define the relevant probability distributions. This feature suggests that the maximally fractional defect can be understood as a kind of product of the RCFT defect and the symmetric orbifold defect.</description>

      <title>Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13847v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Geometry Challenges Entropy: Regime-DependentRectification in Nanofluidic Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can geometry alone reshape equilibrium? Cascaded nanofluidic chambers show complex accumulation patterns, traditionally attributed to geometric diode effects. We use 3D molecular dynamics to decouple funnel rectification from boundary reflection. Simulations with argon parameters (r = 0.19 nm) reveal a striking "reverse" rectification in a 2-chamber setup: the narrow side accumulates over 5x more particles (N_1/N_0 = 5.37 +/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.0001). In a 10-chamber argon cascade, this effect drives massive downstream accumulation. A symmetric control (w_L = w_R) eliminates the gradient, confirming that funnel asymmetry - not boundary/edge effects - is the primary driver in the ballistic regime. By contrast, the super-atom regime is dominated by boundary reflection. Our results challenge standard entropic transport theory and provide design rules for passive, geometry-driven density gradients - no pump, no drive.</description>

      <title>Timescale for macroscopic equilibration in isolated quantum systems: a rigorous derivation for free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of translation-invariant free-fermion systems (including those with uniform nearest neighbor hopping) on a $d$-dimensional $L \times \cdots \times L$ hypercubic lattice, we prove that, starting from an arbitrary pure initial state, the system equilibrates with respect to the coarse-grained density within a timescale of order $L$. This scaling is optimal, since there exist initial states whose equilibration requires time of order $L$. Our result establishes $O(L)$ as the equilibration timescale, as is expected in normal macroscopic systems with a conserved quantity, such as total number of particles.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise induced by weak random-field disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates magnetisation reversal processes driven by an external magnetic field in three-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin models with weak random field disorder. Considering an extremely weak disorder and low temperature, we observe a step-wise hysteresis loop and the appearance of short magnetisation bursts of a characteristic triangular shape; the number of bursts increases with disorder, indicative of Barkhausen-type noise. These phenomena are attributed to the simultaneous reversal at a given external field of segments composed of spins with identical neighbourhoods. A local random field orients one or more spin neighbours, resulting in small, ferromagnetic-like clusters distributed throughout the system. As disorder increases, these clusters may merge to form a labyrinthine structure within the antiferromagnetic background, facilitating brief avalanche propagation. The results demonstrate that, compared with familiar random-field ferromagnets, the observed antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise and the related avalanche sequence have a profoundly different structure, organised into peaks associated with the transition between magnetisation plateaus. They exhibit prominent cyclical trends and disorder-dependent multifractal fluctuations, with the singularity spectrum quantifying the degree of disorder. The activity avalanches exhibit scale invariance resembling that recently found in experiments with disordered ferr\textit{i}magnets and martensites, as well as in quantum Barkhausen noise, which are associated with active geometric regions rather than individual-spin dynamics. The observed scaling behaviour is interpreted in terms of self-organised critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Drift-Diffusion Matching: Embedding dynamics in latent manifolds of asymmetric neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a theoretical framework for understanding computation in biological neural circuits, yet classical results, such as Hopfield's model of associative memory, rely on symmetric connectivity that restricts network dynamics to gradient-like flows. In contrast, biological networks support rich time-dependent behaviour facilitated by their asymmetry. Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation.</description>

      <title>Ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic framework exceeding the ultimate hydrogen storage targets: a first-principles multiscale computational study</title>

Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt\% and 50 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the \textbf{M}ulti-binding \textbf{S}ites \textbf{U}nited in \textbf{C}ovalent-\textbf{O}rganic \textbf{F}ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (\ce{FeCp2}) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt\% and 72.6 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15--20 kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Extending Prometheus for Unsupervised Discovery of Phase Transitions in Three Dimensions and Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\geq 70\%$ accuracy ($\beta = 0.328 \pm 0.015$, $\gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.06$, $\nu = 0.632 \pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $\chi^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\ln \xi \sim |h - h_c|^{-\psi}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $\psi = 0.48 \pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($\psi = 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T &gt; 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.</description>

Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability (SP) at very early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time SP for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring deformations of the PXP hamiltonian and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. We moreover argue that such unconventional early relaxation of scarred initial states is characteristic of a whole class of QMBS models. Since the SP can be easily measured experimentally, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.</description>

Abstract: Classical computations inherently require energy dissipation that increases significantly as the reliability of the computation improves. This dissipation arises when transitions between memory states are not balanced by their time-reversed counterparts. While classical memories exhibit a discrete set of possible time-reversal symmetries, quantum memory offers a continuum. This continuum enables the design of quantum memories that minimize irreversibility. As a result, quantum memory reduces energy dissipation several orders of magnitude below classical memory.</description>

Abstract: We briefly review the problem of Brownian motion and describe some intriguing facets. The problem is first treated in its original form as enunciated by Einstein, Langevin, and others. Then, utilizing the problem of Brownian motion as a paradigm and upon using the Langevin equation(s), we present a brief exposition of the modern areas of stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems in a manner accessible to a non-expert. This is followed by an analysis of non-Markovian Brownian dynamics via generalized Langevin equation(s) in which we particularly shed light onto its derivation, the emergence of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, and the recently-discovered effective-mass framework.</description>

Abstract: The framework of bipartite stochastic thermodynamics is a powerful tool to analyze a composite system's internal thermodynamics. It has been used to study the components of different molecular machines such as ATP synthase. However, this approach has not yet been used to describe ion-transporting proteins despite their high-level functional similarity. Here we study the bipartite thermodynamics of the sodium-potassium pump in the nonequilibrium steady state. Using a physically intuitive partition between the ATP-consuming subsystem and the ion-transporting subsystem, we find considerable information flow comparable to other molecular machines, and Maxwell-demon behavior in the ATP-consuming subsystem. We vary ion concentrations and transmembrane voltage in a range including the neuronal action potential, and find that the information flow inverts during depolarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems exhibit macroscopic behaviors that emerge from the coordinated interactions of their individual components. Understanding the microscopic origins of these emergent properties remains a significant challenge, especially in less-understood systems, due to the absence of a generalized framework for identifying the governing degrees of freedom. The multiscale complexity formalism, developed to address this challenge, consists of a set of information-theoretic indices designed to identify the scales at which collective behaviors emerge. In this article, we evaluate one such index, the complexity profile, by applying it to the two-dimensional Ising model with finite-range interactions. In particular, we show that the complexity profile captures the transition between the disordered and ordered phases by detecting the emergence of multiscale structure 1 exclusively in the critical region, and therefore offering insights into the formation of magnetic domains from an information-theoretic perspective. Additionally, we show that the pairwise complexity exhibits a maximum in the disordered phase that remains bounded in the thermodynamic limit. These results highlight the potential of the multiscale complexity formalism to probe emergent behaviors and detect hidden features of critical phenomena in interacting systems beyond the classical characterization of correlations.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional chaotic dynamics can emerge in a large random recurrent neural network when the synaptic gain crosses a threshold. Recent works showed that the kinetic energy of neural activity links the chaotic dynamics and the supporting unstable fixed points (equilibria) in the phase space. Here, we investigate the kinetic-energy-centric properties of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain) and exhibits a cubic scaling behavior near the critical point from above. This scaling behavior is supported by numerical simulations and provides a quantitative characterization of how fast the dynamics change during the onset of chaos. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems from the kinetic-energy optimization perspective as well. The activity distribution is also analyzed in a geometric angle, establishing a relationship between the original chaotic dynamics and the gradient dynamics of the kinetic energy. The trajectory length on the chaotic manifold can be derived from the stationary kinetic energy, and the associated stationary behavior is analyzed as well. This study provides a kinetic-energy-centric route toward understanding the dynamics landscape of recurrent neural networks, which may provide insights for reservoir computing and even for internal synaptic learning.</description>

      <title>Random planting with harvest: A statistical-mechanical analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.</description>

      <title>Entropic trade-off relations in stochastic thermodynamics via replica Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional thermodynamic trade-off relations usually apply to quantities that depend linearly on probability distributions. In contrast, many important information-theoretic measures, such as entropies, are nonlinear and therefore difficult to analyze with existing frameworks. Motivated by replica methods in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we introduce replica Markov processes, i.e., Markovian dynamics of $K$ independent, identical copies, and derive trade-off relations that bound relative moments of replica observables in terms of the dynamical activity. By choosing appropriate replica observables, these inequalities translate into bounds on nonlinear quantities of the original single process. Focusing on entropic measures of uncertainty, we obtain upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy for general trajectory-observable distributions. Moreover, we derive upper bounds on the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, where the bounds involve the initial dynamical activity. Analogous bounds can be derived for the entropies of the state distribution. In particular, we provide upper bounds on both the time derivative and the value of the Tsallis entropy of state distributions. Moreover, we show that the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies of the state distribution are bounded from above by terms involving the local escape rate from the initial node. We also illustrate how replicas can be used to study other nonlinear functionals such as extreme-value observables. Finally, we extend the construction to continuously monitored open quantum systems, where the bounds are expressed in terms of the quantum dynamical activity. These results provide entropic counterparts to activity-based uncertainty relations and establish a general method for constraining nonlinear information-theoretic quantities in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing self-avoiding walk (GSAW) is a walk on a graph that is directed, does not visit the same vertex twice, and has a trapped endpoint. We show that the generating function enumerating GSAWs on a half-infinite strip of finite height is rational, and we give a procedure to construct a combinatorial finite state machine that allows one to compute this generating function. We then modify this procedure to compute generating functions for GSAWs under two probabilistic models. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected length and displacement for GSAWs on the quarter plane, half plane, full plane, and half-infinite strips of bounded height for which we cannot compute the generating function. Finally, we prove that the generating functions for Greek key tours (GSAWs on a finite grid that visit every vertex) on a half-infinite strip of fixed height are also rational, allowing us to resolve several conjectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport on Bethe lattices with non-Hermitian sources and a drain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum transport in a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice of finite generation, which we expect to be the first step toward analyzing electronic transport in a light-harvesting molecule. We seek conditions under which the electronic current from the peripheral sites to the central site reaches its maximum. As a new feature, we add complex potentials for sources at peripheral sites and a drain at the central site, and solve a non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, instead of simulating an initial-value problem. Solving the eigenvalue problem clearly reveals which electronic channels contribute most to the quantum transport. We find that the number of eigenstates that can penetrate from the peripheral sites to the central site is limited among the total number of eigenstates. All the other eigenstates are localized around the peripheral sites and cannot reach the central site. The former eigenstates can carry current, reducing the problem to quantum transport on a parity-time symmetric tight-binding chain. We find that the current has a maximum with respect to the strengths of the sources and the drain. Counterintuitively, the current decreases as we increase the strengths beyond the maximum and vanishes in the limit of infinite strength. Moreover, we find that the current maximum is given by a zero mode. When the number of links is common to all generations, the current takes the maximum value at the exceptional point where two eigenstates coalesce to a zero mode, which emerges because of the non-Hermiticity due to the PT-symmetric complex potentials. By introducing randomness either into the hopping amplitude or the number of links in each generation of the tree, we obtain a random-hopping tight-binding model, and find that the current reaches its maximum not exactly, but approximately, for a zero mode, although it is no longer located at an exceptional point in general.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three classes of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory built on universal mechanism and full realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral(-like) symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non-heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and (de-)confinement. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Activated solids: Spontaneous deformations, non-affine fluctuations, softening, and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internal activity can fundamentally reshape the mechanical behavior of solids, yet its role in softening and failure remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate spontaneous deformations in activated solids via non-affine fluctuations that quantify local rearrangements relative to global strain. Using scaling analysis and numerical simulations, we show that non-affinity in crystalline solids grows quadratically with active speed, increases linearly with persistence time before saturating, and scales inversely with the distance to the melting density. Spatial correlations reveal an activity-dependent growing correlation length, while relaxation dynamics are governed by the active persistence time. With increasing activity, the distributions of local non-affinity broaden, become more skewed, and develop heavy tails, eventually forming a secondary maximum that signals coexisting small and large non-affinities; this heterogeneity precedes defect formation and two-step melting from solid to hexatic and ultimately to fluid. Finally, we demonstrate that spatially patterned activation provides a simple route to locally induce non-affinity and mechanical softening. Our predictions are experimentally testable and suggest a pathway to tunable mechanics in adaptive metamaterials, with implications for mechanical regulation in biological systems.</description>

Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

      <title>Revisiting vestigial order in nematic superconductors: gauge-field mechanisms and model constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An electronic nematic order that originates from superconducting fluctuation but persists above the superconducting transition temperature is often referred to as a vestigial nematic phase. Such a vestigial order belongs to the broader class of composite orders discussed in earlier literature, characterized by ordering in gauge-invariant combinations of superconducting order parameters while the individual superconducting order parameters remain disordered. These states include metallic superfluids, paired phases, and composite (charge-4e) superconductors. Whether and under what conditions such a vestigial phase can emerge in realistic models of nematic superconductors remains an open question. Recent analytical work [P. T. How and S. K. Yip, Phys. Rev. B 107, 104514 (2023)] concluded that vestigial nematic phases--and related mechanisms--do not appear in the widely studied models proposed for, e.g., Bi$_2$Se$_3$-based candidates. To shed light on this question, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of a nematic superconductor. Consistent with the findings of How and Yip, our numerical results confirm that commonly considered models do not exhibit vestigial nematic phases or nematic-fluctuation-induced charge-4e superconductivity. Extending the analysis to include coupling to a gauge field, we show that vestigial nematic order can, under restrictive conditions, be stabilized through an alternative mechanism: intercomponent coupling mediated by the gauge field or the effects of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki Model for Quantum Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a spin-$S$ ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization $m=(S-1)/S$, which is a ferromagnetic generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$. This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum entanglement inherent in VBS states. In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation. This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field. Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and Wightman power spectrum with positive chemical potential in Schr\"odinger field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity in Schr\"odinger field theory in the grand canonical ensemble with chemical potential $\mu$, with an emphasis on the qualitatively new features that arise for $\mu&gt;0$. In this regime the fermionic Wightman power spectrum is effectively single-sided and sharply truncated at $\omega=\mu$, which induces a crossover in the Lanczos coefficients {and signals a dynamical transition from a bulk-dominated regime to a spectral-edge-dominated regime}: $b_n$ displays a two-stage linear growth (from an early-time slope $\pi/\beta$ to an asymptotic slope $2/\beta$), while $a_n$ bends from near-zero values to a linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$. We provide analytic support for the resulting complexity growth from three complementary viewpoints: (i) using an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction matched to the asymptotic Lanczos data, we show that the late-time Krylov complexity must grow quadratically, $K(t)\propto t^{2}$; (ii) by analyzing engineered Wightman spectra with controlled decay and truncation, we identify single-sided exponential decay as the key spectral feature responsible for the quadratic asymptotics, while an approximately even two-sided exponential spectrum explains the early-time $K(t)\sim\sinh^{2}(\pi t/\beta)$ behavior at large $\mu$; (iii) we formulate the problem in terms of orthogonal polynomials and estimate the crossover scale separating the early- and late-stage regimes. Overall, our results help clarify the role of chemical potential and spectral truncation in shaping operator growth and Krylov complexity in this non-relativistic quantum field theory setting.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Chimeras States in One-dimensional Ising model with Long-Range Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the conditions for the emergence of chimera-like states in Ising systems. We study an Ising chain with periodic boundaries in contact with a thermal bath at temperature T, that induces stochastic changes in spin variables. To capture the non-locality needed for chimera formation, we introduce a model setup with non-local diffusion of spin values through the whole system. More precisely, diffusion is modeled through spin-exchange interactions between units up to a distance R, using Kawasaki dynamics. This setup mimics, e.g., neural media, as the brain, in the presence of electrical (diffusive) interactions. We explored the influence of such non-local dynamics on the emergence of complex spatiotemporal synchronization patterns of activity. Depending on system parameters we report here for the first time chimera-like states in the Ising model, characterized by relatively stable moving domains of spins with different local magnetization. We analyzed the system at T=0, both analytically and via simulations and computed the system's phase diagram, revealing rich behavior: regions with only chimeras, coexistence of chimeras and stable domains, and metastable chimeras that decay into uniform stable domains. This study offers fundamental insights into how coherent and incoherent synchronization patterns can arise in complex networked systems as it is, e.g., the brain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Density Matrices from Time-like Entanglement and Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.</description>

      <title>Entropy of matter on the Carroll geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two prescriptions for the construction of Carroll geometries, the expansion of geometric variables near horizon and the expansion of metric with zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$ (speed of light in vacuum), are known to complement each other. The entropy of an ideal gas, confined in a box and kept very close to the horizon, depends on the transverse area of the container. We show this by using the Carroll geometry constructed through the expansion of the metric and then taking the zero limit of the expansion parameter $c$. Therefore, the present analysis assures the complementing nature of two ways of finding the Carroll geometry from the thermodynamical point of view.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems can be described by unraveling Lindblad master equations into ensembles of quantum trajectories. Here we investigate how the complexity of such trajectories is affected by conservation laws and other dynamical constraints of the underlying Lindblad evolution. We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Krylov distribution $\mathcal{D}(\xi)$, a static Krylov-space diagnostic that characterizes how inverse-energy response is organized in Hilbert space. The central object is the resolvent-dressed state $(H-\xi)^{-1}|\psi_0\rangle$, whose decomposition in the Krylov basis generated from a reference state defines a normalized distribution over Krylov levels. Unlike conventional spectral functions, which resolve response solely along the energy axis, the Krylov distribution captures how the resolvent explores the dynamically accessible subspace as the spectral parameter $\xi$ is varied. Using asymptotic analysis, exact results in solvable models, and numerical studies of an interacting spin chain, we identify three universal regimes: saturation outside the spectral support, extensive growth within continuous spectra, and sublinear or logarithmic scaling near spectral edges and quantum critical points. We further show that fidelity susceptibility and the quantum geometric tensor admit natural decompositions in terms of Krylov-resolved resolvent amplitudes.</description>
