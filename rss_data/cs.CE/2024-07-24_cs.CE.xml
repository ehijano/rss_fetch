      <title>A Survey of AI-Powered Mini-Grid Solutions for a Sustainable Future in Rural Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven mini-grid solutions aimed at enhancing sustainable energy access. It emphasises the potential of mini-grids, which can operate independently or in conjunction with national power grids, to provide reliable and affordable electricity to remote communities. Given the inherent unpredictability of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, the necessity for accurate energy forecasting and management is discussed, highlighting the role of advanced AI techniques in forecasting energy supply and demand, optimising grid operations, and ensuring sustainable energy distribution. This paper reviews various forecasting models, including statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and hybrid approaches, evaluating their effectiveness for both short-term and long-term predictions. Additionally, it explores public datasets and tools such as Prophet, NeuralProphet, and N-BEATS for model implementation and validation. The survey concludes with recommendations for future research, addressing challenges in model adaptation and optimisation for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous Galerkin / cohesive zone model approach for the computational modeling of fracture in geometrically exact slender beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07349</link>

Abstract: Slender beams are often employed as constituents in engineering materials and structures. Prior experiments on lattices of slender beams have highlighted their complex failure response, where the interplay between buckling and fracture plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational approach for modeling fracture in slender beams subjected to large deformations. We adopt a state-of-the-art geometrically exact Kirchhoff beam formulation to describe the finite deformations of beams in three-dimensions. We develop a discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the beam governing equations, incorporating discontinuities in the position and tangent degrees of freedom at the inter-element boundaries of the finite elements. Before fracture initiation, we enforce compatibility of nodal positions and tangents weakly, via the exchange of variationally-consistent forces and moments at the interfaces between adjacent elements. At the onset of fracture, these forces and moments transition to cohesive laws modeling interface failure. We conduct a series of numerical tests to verify our computational framework against a set of benchmarks and we demonstrate its ability to capture the tensile and bending fracture modes in beams exhibiting large deformations. Finally, we present the validation of our framework against fracture experiments of dry spaghetti rods subjected to sudden relaxation of curvature.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach with respect to multivariate pair trading called Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We introduce the method to selectively form a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for simultaneously monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities. To handle the quantitative conflicts that arise when receiving multiple trading signals, a bi-objective convex optimization process is designed to cater to the investor's preference between profitability and risk tolerance. This process includes tunable parameters such as volatility punishment, action thresholds. During our experiments in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022 when the market was experiencing a vigorous bull-run immediately followed by a bear-run, the OTT realized an annualized profit of 15.49%. We further carried out the experiments in bull, bear, and full-cycle market conditions separately, and found that OTT is capable of achieving stable profit under various market conditions. Apart from the profitability side of the OTT, the arbitrage operation provides a new perspective of trading, which requires no external shorting and never hold intermediate cryptocurrency during the arbitrage period.</description>

      <title>Era Splitting: Invariant Learning for Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14496v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-life machine learning problems exhibit distributional shifts in the data from one time to another or from one place to another. This behavior is beyond the scope of the traditional empirical risk minimization paradigm, which assumes i.i.d. distribution of data over time and across locations. The emerging field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization addresses this reality with new theory and algorithms which incorporate "environmental", or "era-wise" information into the algorithms. So far, most research has been focused on linear models and/or neural networks . In this research we develop two new splitting criteria for decision trees, which allow us to apply ideas from OOD generalization research to decision tree models, namely, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). The new splitting criteria use era-wise information associated with the data to grow tree-based models that are optimal across all disjoint eras in the data, instead of optimal over the entire data set pooled together, which is the default setting. In this paper, two new splitting criteria are defined and analyzed theoretically. Effectiveness is tested on four experiments, ranging from simple, synthetic to complex, real-world applications. In particular we cast the OOD domain-adaptation problem in the context of financial markets, where the new models out-perform state-of-the-art GBDT models on the Numerai data set. The new criteria are incorporated into the Scikit-Learn code base and made freely available online.</description>
