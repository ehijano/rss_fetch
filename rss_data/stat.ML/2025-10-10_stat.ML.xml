      <title>Evaluating and Learning Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes under Truncation by Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Truncation by death, a prevalent challenge in critical care, renders traditional dynamic treatment regime (DTR) evaluation inapplicable due to ill-defined potential outcomes. We introduce a principal stratification-based method, focusing on the always-survivor value function. We derive a semiparametrically efficient, multiply robust estimator for multi-stage DTRs, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency. Empirical validation and an application to electronic health records showcase its utility for personalized treatment optimization.</description>

      <title>From Data to Rewards: a Bilevel Optimization Perspective on Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models form the backbone of modern machine learning, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in text, vision, and multimodal applications. While Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning. We release the code at https://github.com/abenechehab/nll_to_po .</description>

      <title>A Honest Cross-Validation Estimator for Prediction Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-validation is a standard tool for obtaining a honest assessment of the performance of a prediction model. The commonly used version repeatedly splits data, trains the prediction model on the training set, evaluates the model performance on the test set, and averages the model performance across different data splits. A well-known criticism is that such cross-validation procedure does not directly estimate the performance of the particular model recommended for future use. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the performance of a model trained on a specific (random) training set. A naive estimator can be obtained by applying the model to a disjoint testing set. Surprisingly, cross-validation estimators computed from other random splits can be used to improve this naive estimator within a random-effects model framework. We develop two estimators -- a hierarchical Bayesian estimator and an empirical Bayes estimator -- that perform similarly to or better than both the conventional cross-validation estimator and the naive single-split estimator. Simulations and a real-data example demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>When Robustness Meets Conservativeness: Conformalized Uncertainty Calibration for Balanced Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust optimization safeguards decisions against uncertainty by optimizing against worst-case scenarios, yet their effectiveness hinges on a prespecified robustness level that is often chosen ad hoc, leading to either insufficient protection or overly conservative and costly solutions. Recent approaches using conformal prediction construct data-driven uncertainty sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees, but they still fix coverage targets a priori and offer little guidance for selecting robustness levels. We propose a new framework that provides distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees on both miscoverage and regret for any family of robust predict-then-optimize policies. Our method constructs valid estimators that trace out the miscoverage-regret Pareto frontier, enabling decision-makers to reliably evaluate and calibrate robustness levels according to their cost-risk preferences. The framework is simple to implement, broadly applicable across classical optimization formulations, and achieves sharper finite-sample performance than existing approaches. These results offer the first principled data-driven methodology for guiding robustness selection and empower practitioners to balance robustness and conservativeness in high-stakes decision-making.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Graph Partitioning for Spatial Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial prediction refers to the estimation of unobserved values from spatially distributed observations. Although recent advances have improved the capacity to model diverse observation types, adoption in practice remains limited in industries that demand interpretability. To mitigate this gap, surrogate models that explain black-box predictors provide a promising path toward interpretable decision making. In this study, we propose a graph partitioning problem to construct spatial segments that minimize the sum of within-segment variances of individual predictions. The assignment of data points to segments can be formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. While this formulation potentially enables the identification of exact segments, its computational complexity becomes prohibitive as the number of data points increases. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an approximation scheme that leverages the structural properties of graph partitioning. Experimental results demonstrate the computational efficiency of this approximation in identifying spatial segments.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Tracking Fisher Information in Adaptive Testing with Stochastic Binary Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a continuous ability parameter from sequential binary responses by actively asking questions with varying difficulties, a setting that arises naturally in adaptive testing and online preference learning. Our goal is to certify that the estimate lies within a desired margin of error, using as few queries as possible. We propose a simple algorithm that adaptively selects questions to maximize Fisher information and updates the estimate using a method-of-moments approach, paired with a novel test statistic to decide when the estimate is accurate enough. We prove that this Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, which are commonly invested in the best-arm identification literature. Our analysis overcomes a key technical challenge in the fixed-budget setting -- handling the dependence between the evolving estimate and the query distribution -- by exploiting a structural symmetry in the model and combining large deviation tools with Ville's inequality. Our results provide rigorous theoretical support for simple and efficient adaptive testing procedures.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of the Median-of-Means Estimator under Adversarial Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Median-of-Means (MoM) is a robust estimator widely used in machine learning that is known to be (minimax) optimal in scenarios where samples are i.i.d. In more grave scenarios, samples are contaminated by an adversary that can inspect and modify the data. Previous work has theoretically shown the suitability of the MoM estimator in certain contaminated settings. However, the (minimax) optimality of MoM and its limitations under adversarial contamination remain unknown beyond the Gaussian case. In this paper, we present upper and lower bounds for the error of MoM under adversarial contamination for multiple classes of distributions. In particular, we show that MoM is (minimax) optimal in the class of distributions with finite variance, as well as in the class of distributions with infinite variance and finite absolute $(1+r)$-th moment. We also provide lower bounds for MoM's error that match the order of the presented upper bounds, and show that MoM is sub-optimal for light-tailed distributions.</description>

      <title>Stick-Breaking Mixture Normalizing Flows with Component-Wise Tail Adaptation for Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalizing flows with a Gaussian base provide a computationally efficient way to approximate posterior distributions in Bayesian inference, but they often struggle to capture complex posteriors with multimodality and heavy tails. We propose a stick-breaking mixture base with component-wise tail adaptation (StiCTAF) for posterior approximation. The method first learns a flexible mixture base to mitigate the mode-seeking bias of reverse KL divergence through a weighted average of component-wise ELBOs. It then estimates local tail indices of unnormalized densities and finally refines each mixture component using a shared backbone combined with component-specific tail transforms calibrated by the estimated indices. This design enables accurate mode coverage and anisotropic tail modeling while retaining exact density evaluation and stable optimization. Experiments on synthetic posteriors demonstrate improved tail recovery and better coverage of multiple modes compared to benchmark models. We also present a real-data analysis illustrating the practical benefits of our approach for posterior inference.</description>

      <title>Beyond Real Data: Synthetic Data through the Lens of Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data can improve generalization when real data is scarce, but excessive reliance may introduce distributional mismatches that degrade performance. In this paper, we present a learning-theoretic framework to quantify the trade-off between synthetic and real data. Our approach leverages algorithmic stability to derive generalization error bounds, characterizing the optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio that minimizes expected test error as a function of the Wasserstein distance between the real and synthetic distributions. We motivate our framework in the setting of kernel ridge regression with mixed data, offering a detailed analysis that may be of independent interest. Our theory predicts the existence of an optimal ratio, leading to a U-shaped behavior of test error with respect to the proportion of synthetic data. Empirically, we validate this prediction on CIFAR-10 and a clinical brain MRI dataset. Our theory extends to the important scenario of domain adaptation, showing that carefully blending synthetic target data with limited source data can mitigate domain shift and enhance generalization. We conclude with practical guidance for applying our results to both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Analysis of Synthetic Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the progress in the development of generative models, their usefulness in creating synthetic data that improve prediction performance of classifiers has been put into question. Besides heuristic principles such as "synthetic data should be close to the real data distribution", it is actually not clear which specific properties affect the generalization error. Our paper addresses this question through the lens of high-dimensional regression. Theoretically, we show that, for linear models, the covariance shift between the target distribution and the distribution of the synthetic data affects the generalization error but, surprisingly, the mean shift does not. Furthermore we prove that, in some settings, matching the covariance of the target distribution is optimal. Remarkably, the theoretical insights from linear models carry over to deep neural networks and generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the covariance matching procedure (matching the covariance of the synthetic data with that of the data coming from the target distribution) performs well against several recent approaches for synthetic data selection, across training paradigms, architectures, datasets and generative models used for augmentation.</description>

      <title>PAC Learnability in the Presence of Performativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the wide-spread adoption of machine learning models in real-world applications, the phenomenon of performativity, i.e. model-dependent shifts in the test distribution, becomes increasingly prevalent. Unfortunately, since models are usually trained solely based on samples from the original (unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased test-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when performative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the classic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate several performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in the label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels and the features. We construct a performative empirical risk function, which depends only on data from the original distribution and on the type performative effect, and is yet an unbiased estimate of the true risk of a classifier on the shifted distribution. Minimizing this notion of performative risk allows us to show that any PAC-learnable hypothesis space in the standard binary classification setting remains PAC-learnable for the considered performative scenarios. We also conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our performative risk minimization method and showcase benefits on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Stopping in Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify and analyze a surprising phenomenon of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) where the final steps of the diffusion can degrade sample quality. In contrast to conventional arguments that justify early stopping for numerical stability, this phenomenon is intrinsic to the dimensionality reduction in LDMs. We provide a principled explanation by analyzing the interaction between latent dimension and stopping time. Under a Gaussian framework with linear autoencoders, we characterize the conditions under which early stopping is needed to minimize the distance between generated and target distributions. More precisely, we show that lower-dimensional representations benefit from earlier termination, whereas higher-dimensional latent spaces require later stopping time. We further establish that the latent dimension interplays with other hyperparameters of the problem such as constraints in the parameters of score matching. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets illustrate these properties, underlining that early stopping can improve generative quality. Together, our results offer a theoretical foundation for understanding how the latent dimension influences the sample quality, and highlight stopping time as a key hyperparameter in LDMs.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Aggregated D-Optimal Designs for Estimating Main Effects in Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in supervised learning have driven growing interest in explaining black-box models, particularly by estimating the effects of input variables on model predictions. However, existing approaches often face key limitations, including poor scalability, sensitivity to out-of-distribution sampling, and instability under correlated features. To address these issues, we propose A2D2E, an $\textbf{E}$stimator based on $\textbf{A}$ccelerated $\textbf{A}$ggregated $\textbf{D}$-Optimal $\textbf{D}$esigns. Our method leverages principled experimental design to improve efficiency and robustness in main effect estimation. We establish theoretical guarantees, including convergence and variance reduction, and validate A2D2E through extensive simulations. We further provide the potential of the proposed method with a case study on real data and applications in language models. The code to reproduce the results can be found at https://github.com/cchihyu/A2D2E.</description>

      <title>Permutation-Invariant Spectral Learning via Dyson Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are central to generative modeling and have been adapted to graphs by diffusing adjacency matrix representations. The challenge of having up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to distinguish certain graph families, unless graph data are augmented with ad hoc features. This shortcoming stems from enforcing the inductive bias within the learning architecture. In this work, we leverage random matrix theory to analytically extract the spectral properties of the diffusion process, allowing us to push the inductive bias from the architecture into the dynamics. Building on this, we introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, which employs Dyson's Brownian Motion to capture the spectral dynamics of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the adjacency matrix while retaining all non-spectral information. We demonstrate that the Dyson Diffusion Model learns graph spectra accurately and outperforms existing graph diffusion models.</description>

      <title>DUA-D2C: Dynamic Uncertainty Aware Method for Overfitting Remediation in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15876v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each. This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set, considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods, establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in modern deep learning.

      <title>ConCuR: Conciseness Makes State-of-the-Art Kernel Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development, leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder, which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch, reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup, our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.</description>

      <title>metabeta - A fast neural model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression. Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually required time.</description>

      <title>Beyond independent component analysis: identifiability and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a classical method for recovering latent variables with useful identifiability properties. For independent variables, cumulant tensors are diagonal; relaxing independence yields tensors whose zero structure generalizes diagonality. These models have been the subject of recent work in non-independent component analysis. We show that pairwise mean independence answers the question of how much one can relax independence: it is identifiable, any weaker notion is non-identifiable, and it contains the models previously studied as special cases. Our results apply to distributions with the required zero pattern at any cumulant tensor. We propose an algebraic recovery algorithm based on least-squares optimization over the orthogonal group. Simulations highlight robustness: enforcing full independence can harm estimation, while pairwise mean independence enables more stable recovery. These findings extend the classical ICA framework and provide a rigorous basis for blind source separation beyond independence.</description>

      <title>Transferable Generative Models Bridge Femtosecond to Nanosecond Time-Step Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging processes that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation. Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to chemistry and biophysics.</description>

      <title>Rotated Mean-Field Variational Inference and Iterative Gaussianization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to perform mean-field variational inference (MFVI) in a rotated coordinate system that reduces correlations between variables. The rotation is determined by principal component analysis (PCA) of a cross-covariance matrix involving the target's score function. Compared with standard MFVI along the original axes, MFVI in this rotated system often yields substantially more accurate approximations with negligible additional cost.
  MFVI in a rotated coordinate system defines a rotation and a coordinatewise map that together move the target closer to Gaussian. Iterating this procedure yields a sequence of transformations that progressively transforms the target toward Gaussian. The resulting algorithm provides a computationally efficient way to construct flow-like transport maps: it requires only MFVI subproblems, avoids large-scale optimization, and yields transformations that are easy to invert and evaluate. In Bayesian inference tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than standard MFVI, while maintaining much lower computational cost than conventional normalizing flows.</description>

      <title>Multi-level informed optimization via decomposed Kriging for large design problems under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering design involves demanding models encompassing many decision variables and uncontrollable parameters. In addition, unavoidable aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties can be very impactful and add further complexity. The state-of-the-art adopts two steps, uncertainty quantification and design optimization, to optimize systems under uncertainty by means of robust or stochastic metrics. However, conventional scenario-based, surrogate-assisted, and mathematical programming methods are not sufficiently scalable to be affordable and precise in large and complex cases. Here, a multi-level approach is proposed to accurately optimize resource-intensive, high-dimensional, and complex engineering problems under uncertainty with minimal resources. A non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate is developed to map the combined design/parameter domain efficiently. Multiple surrogates are adaptively updated by hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to leverage the fewer and most uncertainty-informed data. The proposed method is statistically compared to the state-of-the-art via an analytical testbed and is shown to be concurrently faster and more accurate by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Some theoretical improvements on the tightness of PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model. The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10 for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Lossless Vocabulary Reduction for Auto-Regressive Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application, we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Rank Adaptive Inference of High Dimensional Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits. Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Identifiability via Dynamic Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000) argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification, undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness on real images.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan Dimension is finite. We also show a connection to learning with set-valued feedback. Through our results we show that the learnability of a set learning problem is characterized by the Natarajan Dimension.</description>

      <title>ClauseLens: Clause-Grounded, CVaR-Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Trustworthy Reinsurance Pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data, ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and the EU AI Act.</description>

      <title>gLSTM: Mitigating Over-Squashing by Increasing Storage Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative models that progressively transform probability distributions according to learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally related to the Schr\"odinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples) for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem, plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models, such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels. Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.</description>

      <title>Improving Reasoning for Diffusion Language Models via Group Diffusion Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines, on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the local density field with combined convolutional and point cloud architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field. Our architecture combines a convolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables efficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality relative to a U-Net-only approach. Specifically, our hybrid network recovers both clustering amplitudes and phases better than the U-Net on small scales.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Contextual Bandit: Application to Cryo-EM Data Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a latency-aware contextual bandit framework that generalizes the standard contextual bandit problem, where the learner adaptively selects arms and switches decision sets under action delays. In this setting, the learner observes the context and may select multiple arms from a decision set, with the total time determined by the selected subset. The problem can be framed as a special case of semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs), where contexts and latencies are drawn from an unknown distribution. Leveraging the Bellman optimality equation, we design the contextual online arm filtering (COAF) algorithm, which balances exploration, exploitation, and action latency to minimize regret relative to the optimal average-reward policy. We analyze the algorithm and show that its regret upper bounds match established results in the contextual bandit literature. In numerical experiments on a movie recommendation dataset and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data, we demonstrate that our approach efficiently maximizes cumulative reward over time.</description>

      <title>Distribution Transformers: Fast Approximate Bayesian Inference With On-The-Fly Prior Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for reasoning under uncertainty, its widespread adoption is limited by the intractability of exact posterior computation, necessitating the use of approximate inference. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, or demand costly retraining when priors change, limiting their utility, particularly in sequential inference problems such as real-time sensor fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce the Distribution Transformer -- a novel architecture that can learn arbitrary distribution-to-distribution mappings. Our method can be trained to map a prior to the corresponding posterior, conditioned on some dataset -- thus performing approximate Bayesian inference. Our novel architecture represents a prior distribution as a (universally-approximating) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and transforms it into a GMM representation of the posterior. The components of the GMM attend to each other via self-attention, and to the datapoints via cross-attention. We demonstrate that Distribution Transformers both maintain flexibility to vary the prior, and significantly reduces computation times-from minutes to milliseconds-while achieving log-likelihood performance on par with or superior to existing approximate inference methods across tasks such as sequential inference, quantum system parameter inference, and Gaussian Process predictive posterior inference with hyperpriors.</description>

      <title>Golden Ratio Weighting Prevents Model Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies identified an intriguing phenomenon in recursive generative model training known as model collapse, where models trained on data generated by previous models exhibit severe performance degradation. Addressing this issue and developing more effective training strategies have become central challenges in generative model research. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon within a novel framework, where generative models are iteratively trained on a combination of newly collected real data and synthetic data from the previous training step. To develop an optimal training strategy for integrating real and synthetic data, we evaluate the performance of a weighted training scheme in various scenarios, including Gaussian distribution estimation, generalized linear models, and nonparametric estimation. We theoretically characterize the impact of the mixing proportion and weighting scheme of synthetic data on the final model's performance. Our key finding is that, across different settings, the optimal weighting scheme under different proportions of synthetic data asymptotically follows a unified expression, revealing a fundamental trade-off between leveraging synthetic data and model performance. In some cases, the optimal weight assigned to real data corresponds to the reciprocal of the golden ratio. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on extensive simulated datasets and a real tabular dataset.</description>

      <title>Is Supervised Learning Really That Different from Unsupervised?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how supervised learning can be decomposed into a two-stage procedure, where (1) all model parameters are selected in an unsupervised manner, and (2) the outputs y are added to the model, without changing the parameter values. This is achieved by a new model selection criterion that, in contrast to cross-validation, can be used also without access to y. For linear ridge regression, we bound the asymptotic out-of-sample risk of our method in terms of the optimal asymptotic risk. We also demonstrate on real and synthetic data that versions of linear and kernel ridge regression, smoothing splines, and neural networks, which are trained without access to y, perform similarly to their standard y-based counterparts. Hence, our results suggest that the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is less fundamental than it may appear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub and dense structures. Based on recent results about graphons on line graphs, our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs. We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs, as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.</description>

Abstract: Predicting potential and counterfactual outcomes from observational data is central to clinical decision-making, where physicians must weigh treatments for an individual patient rather than relying solely on average effects at the population level. We propose PO-Flow, a continuous normalizing flow (CNF) framework for causal inference that jointly models potential outcomes and counterfactuals. Trained via flow matching, PO-Flow provides a unified approach to average treatment effect estimation, individualized potential outcome prediction, and counterfactual prediction. Besides, PO-Flow directly learns the densities of potential outcomes, enabling likelihood-based evaluation of predictions. Furthermore, PO-Flow explores counterfactual outcome generation conditioned on the observed factual in general observational datasets, with a supporting recovery result under certain assumptions. PO-Flow outperforms modern baselines across diverse datasets and causal tasks in the potential outcomes framework.</description>

      <title>Continuum Transformers Perform In-Context Learning by Operator Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers robustly exhibit the ability to perform in-context learning, whereby their predictive accuracy on a task can increase not by parameter updates but merely with the placement of training samples in their context windows. Recent works have shown that transformers achieve this by implementing gradient descent in their forward passes. Such results, however, are restricted to standard transformer architectures, which handle finite-dimensional inputs. In the space of PDE surrogate modeling, a generalization of transformers to handle infinite-dimensional function inputs, known as "continuum transformers," has been proposed and similarly observed to exhibit in-context learning. Despite impressive empirical performance, such in-context learning has yet to be theoretically characterized. We herein demonstrate that continuum transformers perform in-context operator learning by performing gradient descent in an operator RKHS. We demonstrate this using novel proof strategies that leverage a generalized representer theorem for Hilbert spaces and gradient flows over the space of functionals of a Hilbert space. We additionally show the operator learned in context is the Bayes Optimal Predictor in the infinite depth limit of the transformer. We then provide empirical validations of this optimality result and demonstrate that the parameters under which such gradient descent is performed are recovered through the continuum transformer training.</description>

      <title>Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a distribution-free framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals in nonstationary time series. TCP couples a modern quantile forecaster with a split-conformal calibration layer on a rolling window and, in its TCP-RM variant, augments the conformal threshold with a single online Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer coverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and a rolling Quantile Regression (QR) baseline across equities (S&amp;P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three results are consistent across assets. First, rolling QR yields the sharpest intervals but is materially under-calibrated (e.g., S&amp;P 500: 83.2% vs. 95% target). Second, TCP (and TCP-RM) achieves near-nominal coverage across assets, with intervals that are wider than Historical Simulation in this evaluation (e.g., S&amp;P 500: 5.21 vs. 5.06). Third, the RM update changes calibration and width only marginally at our default hyperparameters. Crisis-window visualizations around March 2020 show TCP/TCP-RM expanding and then contracting their interval bands promptly as volatility spikes and recedes, with red dots marking days where realized returns fall outside the reported 95% interval (miscoverage). A sensitivity study confirms robustness to window size and step-size choices. Overall, TCP provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution to calibrated uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, bridging statistical inference and machine learning for risk forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line graphs are an alternative representation of graphs where each vertex of the original (root) graph becomes an edge. However not all graphs have a corresponding root graph, hence the transformation from graphs to line graphs is not invertible. We investigate the case when there is a small perturbation in the space of line graphs, and try to recover the corresponding root graph, essentially defining the inverse of the line graph operation. We propose a linear integer program that edits the smallest number of edges in the line graph, that allow a root graph to be found. We use the spectral norm to theoretically prove that such a pseudo-inverse operation is well behaved. Illustrative empirical experiments on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our theoretical results work in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose methods for auditing multiclass classifiers for fairness under multiclass equalized odds,by estimating the deviation from equalized odds when the classifier is not completely fair. We generalize to multiclass classifiers the measure of Disparate Conditional Prediction (DCP), originally suggested by Sabato &amp; Yom-Tov (2020) for binary classifiers. DCP is defined as the fraction of the population for which the classifier predicts with conditional prediction probabilities that differ from the closest common baseline. We provide new local-optimization methods for estimating the multiclass DCPunder two different regimes,one in which the conditional confusion matrices for each protected sub-population are known, and one in which these cannot be estimated, for instance, because the classifier is inaccessible or because good-quality individual-level data is not available. These methods can be used to detect classifiers that likely treat a significant fraction of the population unfairly. Experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the methods.

      <title>TiAda: A Time-scale Adaptive Algorithm for Nonconvex Minimax Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods have shown their ability to adjust the stepsizes on the fly in a parameter-agnostic manner, and empirically achieve faster convergence for solving minimization problems. When it comes to nonconvex minimax optimization, however, current convergence analyses of gradient descent ascent (GDA) combined with adaptive stepsizes require careful tuning of hyper-parameters and the knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. Such a discrepancy arises from the primal-dual nature of minimax problems and the necessity of delicate time-scale separation between the primal and dual updates in attaining convergence. In this work, we propose a single-loop adaptive GDA algorithm called TiAda for nonconvex minimax optimization that automatically adapts to the time-scale separation. Our algorithm is fully parameter-agnostic and can achieve near-optimal complexities simultaneously in deterministic and stochastic settings of nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further justified numerically for a number of machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>On the average-case complexity of learning output distributions of quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that learning the output distributions of brickwork random quantum circuits is average-case hard in the statistical query model. This learning model is widely used as an abstract computational model for most generic learning algorithms. In particular, for brickwork random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $d$, we show three main results:
  - At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning algorithm requires super polynomially many queries to achieve a constant probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  - There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires $\Omega(2^n)$ queries to achieve a $O(2^{-n})$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  - At infinite circuit depth $d\to\infty$, any learning algorithm requires $2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ many queries to achieve a $2^{-2^{\Omega(n)}}$ probability of success over the randomly drawn instance.
  As an auxiliary result of independent interest, we show that the output distribution of a brickwork random quantum circuit is constantly far from any fixed distribution in total variation distance with probability $1-O(2^{-n})$, which confirms a variant of a conjecture by Aaronson and Chen.</description>

      <title>The Poisson Midpoint Method for Langevin Dynamics: Provably Efficient Discretization for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langevin Dynamics is a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) central to sampling and generative modeling and is implemented via time discretization. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Natural Policy Gradient for POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), primarily due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the non-stationarity of optimal policies. In this work, we study a natural actor-critic (NAC) algorithm that integrates recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures into a natural policy gradient (NPG) method and a temporal difference (TD) learning method. This framework leverages the representational capacity of RNNs to address non-stationarity in RL to solve POMDPs while retaining the statistical and computational efficiency of natural gradient methods in RL. We provide non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees for this method, including bounds on sample and iteration complexity to achieve global optimality up to function approximation. Additionally, we characterize pathological cases that stem from long-term dependencies, thereby explaining limitations of RNN-based policy optimization for POMDPs.</description>

      <title>Empirical evaluation of normalizing flows in Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in MCMC use normalizing flows to precondition target distributions and enable jumps to distant regions. However, there is currently no systematic comparison of different normalizing flow architectures for MCMC. As such, many works choose simple flow architectures that are readily available and do not consider other models. Guidelines for choosing an appropriate architecture would reduce analysis time for practitioners and motivate researchers to take the recommended models as foundations to be improved. We provide the first such guideline by extensively evaluating many normalizing flow architectures on various flow-based MCMC methods and target distributions. When the target density gradient is available, we show that flow-based MCMC outperforms classic MCMC for suitable NF architecture choices with minor hyperparameter tuning. When the gradient is unavailable, flow-based MCMC wins with off-the-shelf architectures. We find contractive residual flows to be the best general-purpose models with relatively low sensitivity to hyperparameter choice. We also provide various insights into normalizing flow behavior within MCMC when varying their hyperparameters, properties of target distributions, and the overall computational budget.</description>

      <title>Learning to Partially Defer for Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Learning to Defer (L2D) framework, a prediction model can either make a prediction or defer it to an expert, as determined by a rejector. Current L2D methods train the rejector to decide whether to reject the {\em entire prediction}, which is not desirable when the model predicts long sequences. We present an L2D setting for sequence outputs where the system can defer \textit{specific outputs} of the whole model prediction to an expert in an effort to interleave the expert and machine throughout the prediction. We propose two types of model-based post-hoc rejectors for pre-trained predictors: a token-level rejector, which defers specific token predictions to experts with next token prediction capabilities, and a one-time rejector for experts without such abilities, which defers the remaining sequence from a specific point onward. In the experiments, we also empirically demonstrate that such granular deferrals achieve better cost-accuracy tradeoffs than whole deferrals on Traveling salesman solvers, News summarization, and Weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Rex: Reversible Solvers for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become the state-of-the-art for numerous generation tasks across many different applications. Encoding samples from the data distribution back into the models underlying prior distribution is an important task that arises in many downstream applications. This task is often called the inversion of diffusion models. Prior approaches for solving this task, however, are often simple heuristic solvers that come with several drawbacks in practice. In this work, we propose a new family of solvers for diffusion models by exploiting the connection between this task and the broader study of algebraically reversible solvers for differential equations. In particular, we construct a family of reversible solvers using an application of Lawson methods to construct exponential Runge-Kutta methods for the diffusion models. We call this family of reversible exponential solvers Rex. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers we also emonstrate the utility of the methods through a variety of empirical illustrations.</description>

      <title>A weighted-likelihood framework for class imbalance in Bayesian prediction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance is a pervasive problem in predictive toxicology, where the number of non-toxic compounds often exceeds the number of toxic ones. Models trained on such data often perform well on the majority class but poorly on the minority class, which is most relevant for safety assessment. We propose a simple and general Bayesian framework that addresses class imbalance by modifying the likelihood function. Each observation's likelihood is raised to a power inversely proportional to its class proportion, with the weights normalized to preserve the overall information content. This weighted-likelihood (or power-likelihood) approach embeds cost-sensitive learning directly into Bayesian updating. The method is demonstrated using simulated binary data and an ordered logistic model for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Weighting alters parameter estimates and decision boundaries, improving balanced accuracy and sensitivity for the minority (toxic) class. The approach can be implemented with minimal changes in standard probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, PyMC, and Turing.jl. This framework provides an easily extensible foundation for developing Bayesian prediction models that better reflect the asymmetric costs of safety-critical decisions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.</description>

      <title>Martingale Posterior Neural Networks for Fast Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning of neural network parameters and Bayesian sequential decision making. Unlike classical Bayesian neural networks, which induce predictive uncertainty through a posterior over model parameters, our methods adopt a predictive-first perspective based on martingale posteriors. In particular, we work directly with the one-step-ahead posterior predictive, which we parameterize with a neural network and update sequentially with incoming observations. This decouples Bayesian decision-making from parameter-space inference: we sample from the posterior predictive for decision making, and update the parameters of the posterior predictive via fast, frequentist Kalman-filter-like recursions. Our algorithms operate in a fully online, replay-free setting, providing principled uncertainty quantification without costly posterior sampling. Empirically, they achieve competitive performance-speed trade-offs in non-stationary contextual bandits and Bayesian optimization, offering 10-100 times faster inference than classical Thompson sampling while maintaining comparable or superior decision performance.</description>

      <title>A Kernel Distribution Closeness Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions. Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair. Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images). Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>From Moments to Models: Graphon Mixture-Aware Mixup and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However, modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning (GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2) For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally, by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL) improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6 out of 7 datasets.</description>
