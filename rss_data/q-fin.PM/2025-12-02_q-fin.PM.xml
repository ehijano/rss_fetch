      <title>Convergence Rates of Turnpike Theorems for Portfolio Choice in Stochastic Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turnpike theorems state that if an investor's utility is asymptotically equivalent to a power utility, then the optimal investment strategy converges to the CRRA strategy as the investment horizon tends to infinity. This paper aims to derive the convergence rates of the turnpike theorem for optimal feedback functions in stochastic factor models. In these models, optimal feedback functions can be decomposed into two terms: myopic portfolios and excess hedging demands. We obtain convergence rates for myopic portfolios in nonlinear stochastic factor models and for excess hedging demands in quadratic term structure models, where the interest rate is a quadratic function of a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We show that the convergence rates are determined by (i) the decay speed of the price of a zero-coupon bond and (ii) how quickly the investor's utility becomes power-like at high levels of wealth. As an application, we consider optimal collective investment problems and show that sharing rules for terminal wealth affect convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dominance Constrained Optimization with S-shaped Utilities: Poor-Performance-Region Algorithm and Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the static portfolio selection problem of S-shaped and non-concave utility maximization under first-order and second-order stochastic dominance (SD) constraints. In many S-shaped utility optimization problems, one should require a liquidation boundary to guarantee the existence of a finite concave envelope function. A first-order SD (FSD) constraint can replace this requirement and provide an alternative for risk management. We explicitly solve the optimal solution under a general S-shaped utility function with a first-order stochastic dominance constraint. However, the second-order SD (SSD) constrained problem under non-concave utilities is difficult to solve analytically due to the invalidity of Sion's maxmin theorem. For this sake, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain a plausible and sub-optimal solution for general non-concave utilities. The key idea is to detect the poor performance region with respect to the SSD constraints, characterize its structure and modify the distribution on that region to obtain (sub-)optimality. A key financial insight is that the decision maker should follow the SD constraint on the poor performance scenario while conducting the unconstrained optimal strategy otherwise. We provide numerical experiments to show that our algorithm effectively finds a sub-optimal solution in many cases. Finally, we develop an algorithm-guided piecewise-neural-network framework to learn the solution of the SSD problem, which demonstrates accelerated convergence compared to standard neural network approaches.</description>

      <title>Early-Warning Signals of Political Risk in Stablecoin Markets: Human and Algorithmic Behavior Around the 2024 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the 2024 U.S. presidential election, viewed as a major political risk event, affected cryptocurrency markets by distinguishing human-driven peer-to-peer stablecoin transactions from automated algorithmic activity. Using structural break analysis, we find that human-driven Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC-20) transactions shifted on November 3, two days before the election, while exchange trading volumes reacted only on Election Day. Automated smart-contract activity adjusted much later, with structural breaks appearing in January 2025. We validate these shifts using surrogate-based robustness tests. Complementary energy-spectrum analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum identifies pronounced post-election turbulence, and a structural vector autoregression confirms a regime shift in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, human-driven stablecoin flows act as early-warning indicators of political stress, preceding both exchange behavior and algorithmic responses.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Portfolio Selection under Utility-Variance Analysis of Log Returns in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a time-inconsistent portfolio selection problem in the incomplete mar ket model, integrating expected utility maximization with risk control. The objective functional
  balances the expected utility and variance on log returns, giving rise to time inconsistency and
  motivating the search of a time-consistent equilibrium strategy. We characterize the equilibrium
  via a coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) system and establish
  the existence theory in two special cases: (i)the two Brownian motions driven the price dynamics
  and the factor process are independent with $\rho = 0$; (ii) the trading strategy is constrained to
  be bounded. For the general case with correlation coefficient $\rho \neq 0$, we introduce the notion
  of an approximate time-consistent equilibrium. Employing the solution structure from the
  equilibrium in the case $\rho = 0$, we can construct an approximate time-consistent equilibrium in
  the general case with an error of order $O(\rho^2)$. Numerical examples and financial insights are
  also presented based on deep learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>In-Sample and Out-of-Sample Sharpe Ratios for Linear Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how much the in-sample performance of trading strategies based on linear predictive models is reduced out-of-sample due to overfitting. More specifically, we compute the in- and out-of-sample means and variances of the corresponding PnLs and use these to derive a closed-form approximation for the corresponding Sharpe ratios. We find that the out-of-sample "replication ratio" diminishes for complex strategies with many assets based on many weak rather than a few strong trading signals, and increases when more training data is used. The substantial quantitative importance of these effects is illustrated with a simulation case study for commodity futures following the methodology of G\^arleanu and Pedersen, and an empirical case study using the dataset compiled by Goyal, Welch and Zafirov.</description>
