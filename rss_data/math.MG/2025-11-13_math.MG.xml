      <title>$\varepsilon$-neighbourhoods in the Plane with a Nowhere-smooth Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an example of a planar set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ for which the boundary $\partial E_\varepsilon$ of its $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood $E_\varepsilon = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \, : \, \textrm{dist}(x, E) \leq \varepsilon \}$ is nowhere $C^1$-smooth, in the sense that the set of singularities on the boundary is countably dense (where we note that the latter set cannot be uncountable). Furthermore, we give an example of a planar set $E$ for which $\partial E_\varepsilon$ has the same properties as above, but in addition contains an uncountable subset, with non-integer Hausdorff dimension, where curvature is not defined. Both constructions make use of a characterisation of those star-shaped sets that are an $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of one of their subsets.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds for $s$-Distance Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalization of equiangular lines, equiangular subspaces were first systematically studied by Balla, Dr\"{a}xler, Keevash and Sudakov in 2017. In this paper, we extend their work to $s$-distance subspaces, i.e., to sets of $k$-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose pairwise distances take $s$ distinct values. We establish upper bounds on the maximum cardinality of such sets. In particular, our bounds generalize and improve results of Balla and Sudakov.</description>

      <title>Vietoris--Rips complexes of ellipses at larger scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $X$ a metric space and $r&gt;0$, the Vietoris--Rips simplicial complex $\mathrm{VR}(X;r)$ has $X$ as its vertex set, and a finite subset $\sigma \subseteq X$ as a simplex whenever the diameter of $\sigma$ is less than $r$. In ``On Vietoris--Rips complexes of ellipses'', the authors studied the homotopy types of Vietoris--Rips complexes of ellipses $E_a=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2~|~(x/a)^2+y^2=1\}$ of small eccentricity, meaning $1&lt;a&lt; \sqrt{2}$, at small scales $r &lt; \frac{4\sqrt{3}a^2}{3a^2+1}$. In this paper, we further investigate the homotopy types that appear at larger scales. In particular, we identify the scale parameters $r$, as a function of the eccentricity $a$, for which the Vietoris--Rips complex $\mathrm{VR}(E_a;r)$ is homotopy equivalent to a $3$-sphere, to a wedge sum of $4$-spheres, or to a $5$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric embeddings for shrinking maps from surfaces into the moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate shrinking maps from a cusped hyperbolic surface into the moduli space of closed Riemann surfaces. For such a map and its lift to the Teichm\"uller space, we consider whether they are quasi-isometric embeddings with respect to natural metrics like the Teichm\"uller distance and the intrinsic distance. Under a mild condition, we prove that these properties are characterised solely by the map's monodromy. These characterisations apply, in particular, to holomorphic maps.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and tangent cones of smocked spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smocked spaces are a class of metric spaces which were introduced to generalize pulled thread spaces. We investigate convergence of these spaces, showing that if the underlying smocking sets converge in Hausdorff distance and satisfy local uniform bounds on the smocking constants, then the associated smocked spaces converge in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We prove a corresponding precompactness result using a similar assumption on the smocking constants. We also show that every finite-dimensional normed vector space arises as the tangent cone at infinity of a suitably constructed smocked space. Finally, we extend the convergence theory to the setting of smocked metric measure spaces, proving stability under pointed measured Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. These results establish a basic geometric framework for smocked spaces and demonstrate that they exhibit controlled limit behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantitative tightness for three-dimensional contact manifolds: a sub-Riemannian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the use of sub-Riemannian metrics we provide quantitative estimates for the maximal tight neighbourhood of a Reeb orbit on a three-dimensional contact manifold. Under appropriate geometric conditions we show how to construct closed curves which are boundaries of overtwisted disks. We introduce the concept of \emph{contact} Jacobi curve, and prove lower bounds of the so-called tightness radius (from a Reeb orbit) in terms of Schwarzian derivative bounds. We compare these results with the corresponding ones from [Etnyre, Komendarczyk, Massot - Invent. Math. 2012 and Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2016], and we show that our estimates are sharp for classical model structures. We also prove similar, but non-sharp, estimates in terms of sub-Riemannian canonical curvature bounds. We apply our results to K-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds. In this setting, we prove a contact analogue of the celebrated Cartan--Hadamard theorem.</description>

      <title>Fixed-strength spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spherical $t$-design is a finite subset $X$ of the unit sphere such that every polynomial of degree at most $t$ has the same average over $X$ as it does over the entire sphere. Determining the minimum possible size of spherical designs, especially in a fixed dimension as $t \to \infty$, has been an important research topic for several decades. This paper presents results on the complementary asymptotic regime, where $t$ is fixed and the dimension tends to infinity. The main results in this paper are (1) a construction of smaller spherical designs via an explicit connection to Gaussian designs and (2) the exact order of magnitude of minimal-size signed $t$-designs, which is far less than predicted by a typical degrees-of-freedom heuristic. We also establish a method to ``project'' spherical designs between dimensions, prove a variety of results on approximate designs, and construct new $t$-wise independent subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,q\}^d$ which may be of independent interest. To achieve these results, we combine techniques from algebra, geometry, probability, representation theory, and optimization.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian correlation inequality for centered convex sets and the case of equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Milman's recent observation, we prove that the Gaussian correlation inequality holds for convex sets having the same barycenter, and especially for centered ones. This gives an affirmative answer to the problem proposed by Szarek and Werner. We also characterize the equality case. The study of the equality case in the non-symmetric Gaussian correlation inequality relates to the following question: Let $X$ be a standard Gaussian random vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. For which convex sets $K_1,K_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, are the two events $\{X\in K_1\}$ and $\{X\in K_2\}$ independent? By imposing an additional normalization that $K_1$ and $K_2$ have the same barycenter, we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for this independence. The conditions also identify when $\|X\|_{K_1}$ and $\|X\|_{K_2}$ are independent as random variables.</description>

      <title>Limits of Discrete Energy of Families of Increasing Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hausdorff dimension of a set can be detected using the Riesz energy. Here, we consider situations where a sequence of points, $\{x_n\}$, ``fills in'' a set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in an appropriate sense and investigate the degree to which the discrete analog to the Riesz energy of these sets can be used to bound the Hausdorff dimension of $E$. We also discuss applications to data science and Erd\H{o}s/Falconer type problems.</description>

      <title>On the Coarse Lusternik-Schnirelmann Category of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse analog of the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category which we denote by $\text{c-cat}$, defined for metric spaces in the coarse homotopy category. This provides a new tool for studying large-scale topological properties of groups and spaces. We establish that $\text{c-cat}$ is a coarse homotopy invariant and prove a lower-bound $\text{p-cat}(\Gamma)\leq \text{c-cat}(\Gamma)$ for geometrically finite groups $\Gamma$, where $\text{p-cat}$ denotes the proper LS-category introduced in 1992 by Ayala and co-authors. We also prove an upper bound $\text{c-cat}(\Gamma) \leq \text{asdim}(\Gamma)$ for bicombable 1-ended groups which are semistable at $\infty$.</description>
