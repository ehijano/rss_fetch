      <title>Embedding classic chaotic maps in simple discrete-time memristor circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years the literature has witnessed a remarkable surge of interest for maps implemented by discrete-time (DT) memristor circuits. This paper investigates on the reasons underlying this type of complex behavior. To this end, the papers considers the map implemented by the simplest memristor circuit given by a capacitor and an ideal flux-controlled memristor or an inductor and an ideal charge-controlled memristor. In particular, the manuscript uses the DT flux-charge analysis method (FCAM) introduced in a recent paper to ensure that the first integrals and foliation in invariant manifolds of continuous-time (CT) memristor circuits are preserved exactly in the discretization for any step size. DT-FCAM yields a two-dimensional map in the voltage-current domain (VCD) and a manifold-dependent one-dimensional map in the flux-charge domain (FCD), i.e., a one-dimensional map on each invariant manifold. One main result is that, for suitable choices of the circuit parameters and memristor nonlinearities, both DT circuits can exactly embed two classic chaotic maps, i.e., the logistic map and the tent map. Moreover, due to the property of extreme multistability, the DT circuits can simultaneously embed in the manifolds all the dynamics displayed by varying one parameter in the logistic and tent map. The paper then considers a DT memristor Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua circuit and its dual. Via DT-FCAM these circuits implement a three-dimensional map in the VCD and a two-dimensional map on each invariant manifold in the FCD. It is shown that both circuits can simultaneously embed in the manifolds all the dynamics displayed by two other classic chaotic maps, i.e., the Henon map and the Lozi map, when varying one parameter in such maps. In essence, these results provide an explanation of why it is not surprising to observe complex dynamics even in simple DT memristor circuits.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two coupled massive oscillators in the time-delayed Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the impact of time delay on two coupled massive oscillators within the second-order Kuramoto model, which is relevant to the operations of real-world networks that rely on signal transmission speed constraints. Our analytical and numerical exploration shows that time delay can cause multi-stability within phase-locked solutions, and the stability of these solutions decreases as inertia increases. In addition to phase-locked solutions, we discovered non-phase-locked solutions that exhibit periodic and chaotic behaviors, depending on the amount of inertia and time delay.</description>
