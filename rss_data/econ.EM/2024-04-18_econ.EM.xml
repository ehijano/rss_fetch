      <title>Partial Identification of Heteroskedastic Structural VARs: Theory and Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider structural vector autoregressions identified through stochastic volatility. Our focus is on whether a particular structural shock is identified by heteroskedasticity without the need to impose any sign or exclusion restrictions. Three contributions emerge from our exercise: (i) a set of conditions under which the matrix containing structural parameters is partially or globally unique; (ii) a statistical procedure to assess the validity of the conditions mentioned above; and (iii) a shrinkage prior distribution for conditional variances centred on a hypothesis of homoskedasticity. Such a prior ensures that the evidence for identifying a structural shock comes only from the data and is not favoured by the prior. We illustrate our new methods using a U.S. fiscal structural model.</description>

      <title>Estimation for conditional moment models based on martingale difference divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new estimation method for conditional moment models via the martingale difference divergence (MDD).Our MDD-based estimation method is formed in the framework of a continuum of unconditional moment restrictions. Unlike the existing estimation methods in this framework, the MDD-based estimation method adopts a non-integrable weighting function, which could grab more information from unconditional moment restrictions than the integrable weighting function to enhance the estimation efficiency. Due to the nature of shift-invariance in MDD, our MDD-based estimation method can not identify the intercept parameters. To overcome this identification issue, we further provide a two-step estimation procedure for the model with intercept parameters. Under regularity conditions, we establish the asymptotics of the proposed estimators, which are not only easy-to-implement with analytic asymptotic variances, but also applicable to time series data with an unspecified form of conditional heteroskedasticity. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed estimators by simulations and two real examples.</description>

      <title>Forecasting with panel data: Estimation uncertainty versus parameter heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of the predictive accuracy of panel forecasting methods based on individual, pooling, fixed effects, and Bayesian estimation, and propose optimal weights for forecast combination schemes. We consider linear panel data models, allowing for weakly exogenous regressors and correlated heterogeneity. We quantify the gains from exploiting panel data and demonstrate how forecasting performance depends on the degree of parameter heterogeneity, whether such heterogeneity is correlated with the regressors, the goodness of fit of the model, and the cross-sectional ($N$) and time ($T$) dimensions. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications to house prices and CPI inflation show that forecast combination and Bayesian forecasting methods perform best overall and rarely produce the least accurate forecasts for individual series.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces marginal density functions of the general Bayesian Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive (MS-VAR) process. In the case of the Bayesian MS-VAR process, we provide closed--form density functions and Monte-Carlo simulation algorithms, including the importance sampling method. The Monte--Carlo simulation method departs from the previous simulation methods because it removes the duplication in a regime vector.</description>

      <title>Weighted-Average Least Squares for Negative Binomial Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model averaging methods have become an increasingly popular tool for improving predictions and dealing with model uncertainty, especially in Bayesian settings. Recently, frequentist model averaging methods such as information theoretic and least squares model averaging have emerged. This work focuses on the issue of covariate uncertainty where managing the computational resources is key: The model space grows exponentially with the number of covariates such that averaged models must often be approximated. Weighted-average least squares (WALS), first introduced for (generalized) linear models in the econometric literature, combines Bayesian and frequentist aspects and additionally employs a semiorthogonal transformation of the regressors to reduce the computational burden. This paper extends WALS for generalized linear models to the negative binomial (NB) regression model for overdispersed count data. A simulation experiment and an empirical application using data on doctor visits were conducted to compare the predictive power of WALS for NB regression to traditional estimators. The results show that WALS for NB improves on the maximum likelihood estimator in sparse situations and is competitive with lasso while being computationally more efficient.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Algorithms for Causal Inference with Panel Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conducting causal inference with panel data is a core challenge in social science research. We adapt a deep neural architecture for time series forecasting (the N-BEATS algorithm) to more accurately impute the counterfactual evolution of a treated unit had treatment not occurred. Across a range of settings, the resulting estimator (``SyNBEATS'') significantly outperforms commonly employed methods (synthetic controls, two-way fixed effects), and attains comparable or more accurate performance compared to recently proposed methods (synthetic difference-in-differences, matrix completion). An implementation of this estimator is available for public use. Our results highlight how advances in the forecasting literature can be harnessed to improve causal inference in panel data settings.</description>

      <title>Local Projection Inference in High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we estimate impulse responses by local projections in high-dimensional settings. We use the desparsified (de-biased) lasso to estimate the high-dimensional local projections, while leaving the impulse response parameter of interest unpenalized. We establish the uniform asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under general conditions. Finally, we demonstrate small sample performance through a simulation study and consider two canonical applications in macroeconomic research on monetary policy and government spending.</description>

      <title>The Role of Carbon Pricing in Food Inflation: Evidence from Canadian Provinces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon pricing, including carbon tax and cap-and-trade, is usually seen as an effective policy tool for mitigating emissions. Although such policies are often perceived as worsening affordability issues, earlier studies find insignificant or deflationary effects of carbon pricing. We verify this result for the food sector by using provincial-level data on food CPI from Canada. By using a staggered difference-in-difference (DiD) approach, we show that the deflationary effects of carbon pricing on food do exist. Additionally, such effects are weak at first and grow stronger after two years of implementation. However, the overall magnitudes are too small to make carbon pricing blamable for the current high inflation. Our subsequent analysis suggests a reduction in consumption is likely to be the cause of deflation. Contrarily, carbon pricing has little impact on farm production costs owing to the special treatment farmers receive within carbon pricing systems. This paper decomposes the long-term influence Canadian carbon pricing has on food affordability and its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Use of Binary Choice Forests to Model and Estimate Discrete Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.01109v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problem definition. In retailing, discrete choice models (DCMs) are commonly used to capture the choice behavior of customers when offered an assortment of products. When estimating DCMs using transaction data, flexible models (such as machine learning models or nonparametric models) are typically not interpretable and hard to estimate, while tractable models (such as the multinomial logit model) tend to misspecify the complex behavior represeted in the data. Methodology/results. In this study, we use a forest of binary decision trees to represent DCMs. This approach is based on random forests, a popular machine learning algorithm. The resulting model is interpretable: the decision trees can explain the decision-making process of customers during the purchase. We show that our approach can predict the choice probability of any DCM consistently and thus never suffers from misspecification. Moreover, our algorithm predicts assortments unseen in the training data. The mechanism and errors can be theoretically analyzed. We also prove that the random forest can recover preference rankings of customers thanks to the splitting criterion such as the Gini index and information gain ratio. Managerial implications. The framework has unique practical advantages. It can capture customers' behavioral patterns such as irrationality or sequential searches when purchasing a product. It handles nonstandard formats of training data that result from aggregation. It can measure product importance based on how frequently a random customer would make decisions depending on the presence of the product. It can also incorporate price information and customer features. Our numerical experiments using synthetic and real data show that using random forests to estimate customer choices can outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning with Competing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01884v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision makers often aim to learn a treatment assignment policy under a capacity constraint on the number of agents that they can treat. When agents can respond strategically to such policies, competition arises, complicating estimation of the optimal policy. In this paper, we study capacity-constrained treatment assignment in the presence of such interference. We consider a dynamic model where the decision maker allocates treatments at each time step and heterogeneous agents myopically best respond to the previous treatment assignment policy. When the number of agents is large but finite, we show that the threshold for receiving treatment under a given policy converges to the policy's mean-field equilibrium threshold. Based on this result, we develop a consistent estimator for the policy gradient. In a semi-synthetic experiment with data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, we demonstrate that this estimator can be used for learning capacity-constrained policies in the presence of strategic behavior.</description>
