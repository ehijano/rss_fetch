      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks Enable High Fidelity Shear Wave Viscoelastography across Multiple organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.</description>

      <title>An imageless magnetic resonance framework for fast and cost-effective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for non-invasive tissue abnormality detection, yet hardware complexity, long acquisition times, and high cost limit rapid screening and point-of-care use. We introduce Imageless Magnetic Resonance Diagnosis (IMRD), a framework that bypasses k-space sampling and image reconstruction by analyzing raw one-dimensional MR signals. IMRD integrates (i) optimized pulse sequences for time-domain contrast, (ii) minimal low-field hardware, and (iii) AI-driven pattern recognition to answer clinical closed queries and quantify lesion burden. As a proof of concept, we simulate multiple sclerosis lesions in silico within brain phantoms and deploy two approximately 3 s protocols (single-spoke and gradientless). A 1D convolutional neural network achieves AUC close to 0.95 for lesion detection and R2 close to 0.99 for volume estimation. We also perform robustness tests under reduced signal-to-noise ratio, partial signal omission, and relaxation-time variability. By reframing MR signals as direct diagnostic metrics, IMRD paves the way for fast, low-cost MR screening and monitoring in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Toolkit for Multiparameter Cardiovascular Physiology Sensing on Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04172v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart rings offer a convenient way to continuously and unobtrusively monitor cardiovascular physiological signals. However, a gap remains between the ring hardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly due to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools. In this work, we present $\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset designed for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises photoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis accelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive optical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven activities. $\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as well as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four ground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used physics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our results show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best MAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\% for oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further research and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health sensing.</description>

      <title>Censor-Aware Semi-Supervised Survival Time Prediction in Lung Cancer Using Clinical and Radiomics Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: Lung cancer poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic methods for personalized treatment. This study introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that integrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models handling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET and CT data from 199 lung cancer patients from public and local data respositories, focusing on overall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep Radiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA software and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of censored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio survival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold cross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET HRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.5%, achieving 1.55 years with PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR (p&lt;0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR achieved an MAE of 2.08 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p&lt;0.05). In HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating high- and low-risk groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the SSL strategy significantly outperforms SL across PET, CT, and CF. As such, censor-aware SSL applied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction performance by 26.5% compared to the SL approach.</description>
