      <title>Reply to Structural Vulnerability in Y00 Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper arXiv:2412.07300v1 [quant-ph] 10 Dec 2024, entitled "Structural Vulnerability in Y00 Protocols", by Kentaro Imafuku analyzes "Secure Communication Using Mesoscopic Coherent States", Phys. Rev. Lett., 90:227901, Jun 2003, by Geraldo A. Barbosa, Eric Corndorf, Prem Kumar, and Horace P. Yuen. Imafuku states that in his analyzes a structural vulnerability was revealed that enables the leakage of secret information from the measurement results in the Y00 protocol. Furthermore, it is also stated that an even simpler model, but based on the same original principles, can be more efficient than the original Y00 protocol. This reply shows that: 1) the alleged vulnerability is due to a misinterpretation of one result by Imafuku and 2) that the simple model proposed by him is more vulnerable than the original Y00.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Conformal Methods for Multi-Output Uncertainty: A Holistic Exploration and Experimental Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified approach to harness quantum conformal methods for multi-output distributions, with a particular emphasis on two experimental paradigms: (i) a standard 2-qubit circuit scenario producing a four-dimensional outcome distribution, and (ii) a multi-basis measurement setting that concatenates measurement probabilities in different bases (Z, X, Y) into a twelve-dimensional output space. By combining a multioutput regression model (e.g., random forests) with distributional conformal prediction, we validate coverage and interval-set sizes on both simulated quantum data and multi-basis measurement data. Our results confirm that classical conformal prediction can effectively provide coverage guarantees even when the target probabilities derive from inherently quantum processes. Such synergy opens the door to next-generation quantum-classical hybrid frameworks, providing both improved interpretability and rigorous coverage for quantum machine learning tasks.

      <title>Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</description>

      <title>Parent Lindbladians for Matrix Product Density Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum phases of matter is a fundamental goal in physics. For pure states, the representatives of phases are the ground states of locally interacting Hamiltonians, which are also renormalization fixed points (RFPs). These RFP states are exactly described by tensor networks. Extending this framework to mixed states, matrix product density operators (MPDOs) which are RFPs are believed to encapsulate mixed-state phases of matter in one dimension. However, it remains an open question whether, by analogy, such MPDO RFPs can be realized as steady states of local Lindbladians. In this work, we resolve this question by analytically constructing parent Lindbladians for MPDO RFPs. These Lindbladians are local, frustration-free, and exhibit minimal steady-state degeneracy. Interestingly, we find that parent Lindbladians possess a rich structure, including non-commutativity for certain classes of RFPs, distinguishing them from their Hamiltonian counterparts.</description>

      <title>Perfect, Pretty Good and Optimized Quantum State Transfer in Transmon qubit chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chains of transmon qubits are considered promising systems to implement different quantum information tasks. In particular as channels that perform high-quality quantum state transfer. We study how changing the interaction strength between the chain qubits allows us to obtain perfect or pretty good state transfer and present explicit analytic expressions for their transmission fidelity. For particular values of the interactions between the qubits, transmon chains are equivalent to generalized SSH chains and show the traditional traits observed in chains with topological states, localized states at the extremes of the chain, and eigenvalues that lie inside the spectral gap. Consequently, we study the quantum state transfer on chains with dimerized interactions, looking for chains with fast transfer times. We show that, in many cases, asking for fast transfer times results in chains with dimerized interactions that do not have topological states.</description>

      <title>Inference of response functions with the help of machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Response functions are a key quantity to describe the near-equilibrium dynamics of strongly-interacting many-body systems. Recent techniques that attempt to overcome the challenges of calculating these \emph{ab initio} have employed expansions in terms of orthogonal polynomials. We employ a neural network prediction algorithm to reconstruct a response function $S(\omega)$ defined over a range in frequencies $\omega$. We represent the calculated response function as a truncated Chebyshev series whose coefficients can be optimized to reduce the representation error. We compare the quality of response functions obtained using coefficients calculated using a neural network (NN) algorithm with those computed using the Gaussian Integral Transform (GIT) method. In the regime where only a small number of terms in the Chebyshev series are retained, we find that the NN scheme outperforms the GIT method.</description>

      <title>Electrically-triggered spin-photon devices in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networking and computing technologies demand scalable hardware with high-speed control for large systems of quantum devices. Solid-state platforms have emerged as promising candidates, offering scalable fabrication for a wide range of qubits. Architectures based on spin-photon interfaces allow for highly-connected quantum networks over photonic links, enabling entanglement distribution for quantum networking and distributed quantum computing protocols. With the potential to address these demands, optically-active spin defects in silicon are one proposed platform for building quantum technologies. Here, we electrically excite the silicon T centre in integrated optoelectronic devices that combine nanophotonic waveguides and cavities with p-i-n diodes. We observe single-photon electroluminescence from a cavity-coupled T centre with $g^{(2)}(0)=0.05(2)$. Further, we use the electrically-triggered emission to herald the electron spin state, initializing it with $92(8)\%$ fidelity. This shows, for the first time, electrically-injected single-photon emission from a silicon colour centre and a new method of electrically-triggered spin initialization. These findings present a new telecommunications band light source for silicon and a highly parallel control method for T centre quantum processors, advancing the T centre as a versatile defect for scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic errors in adiabatic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics implies that if a system is in a discrete eigenstate of a Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian evolves in time arbitrarily slowly, the system will remain in the corresponding eigenstate of the evolved Hamiltonian. Understanding corrections to the adiabatic result that arise when the evolution of the Hamiltonian is slow -- but not arbitrarily slow -- has become increasingly important, especially since adiabatic evolution has been proposed as a method of state preparation in quantum computing. This paper identifies two regimes, an adiabatic regime in which corrections are generically small and can depend on details of the evolution throughout the path, and a hyperadiabatic regime in which the error is given by a form similar to an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the evolution time with the coefficients depending principally on the behavior at the endpoints. However, the error in this hyperadiabatic regime is neither given by a true asymptotic series nor solely dependent on the endpoints: the coefficients combine the contributions from both endpoints, with relative phase factors that depend on the average spectral gaps along the trajectory, multiplied by the evolution time. The central result of this paper is to identify a quantity, referred to as the typical error, which is obtained by appropriately averaging the error over evolution times that are small compared to the evolution time itself. This typical error is characterized by an asymptotic series and depends solely on the endpoints of the evolution, remaining independent of the details of the intermediate evolution.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Quantum Neural Architecture Search for The Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in quantum machine learning advocated the use of hybrid models to assist with the limitations of the currently existing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, but what was missing from most of them was the explanations and interpretations of the choices that were made to pick those exact architectures and the differentiation between good and bad hybrid architectures, this research attempts to tackle that gap in the literature by using the Regularized Evolution algorithm to search for the optimal hybrid classical-quantum architecture for the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, ultimately the classical models dominated the leaderboard with the best hybrid model coming in eleventh place among all unique models, while we also try to explain the factors that contributed to such results,and for some models to behave better than others in hope to grasp a better intuition about what we should consider good practices for designing an efficient hybrid architecture.</description>

      <title>Selective Excitation of Superconducting Qubits with a Shared Control Line through Pulse Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional architectures of superconducting quantum computers, each qubit is connected to its own control line, leading to a commensurate increase in the number of microwave lines as the system scales. Frequency-multiplexed qubit-control addresses this problem by enabling multiple qubits to share a single microwave line. However, it can cause unwanted excitation of non-target qubits, especially when the detuning between qubits is smaller than the pulse bandwidth. Here, we propose a selective-excitation-pulse (SEP) technique that suppresses unwanted excitations by shaping a drive pulse to create null points at non-target qubit frequencies. In a proof-of-concept experiment with three fixed-frequency transmon qubits, we demonstrate that the SEP technique achieves single-qubit gate fidelities comparable to those obtained with conventional Gaussian pulses while effectively suppressing unwanted excitations in non-target qubits. These results highlight the SEP technique as a promising tool for enhancing frequency-multiplexed qubit-control.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Quantum Steering with Limited Resources: A Semi-supervised Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum steering, an intermediate quantum correlation lying between entanglement and nonlocality, has emerged as a critical quantum resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks such as quantum key distribution and true randomness generation. The ability to detect and quantify quantum steering is crucial for these applications. Semi-definite programming (SDP) has proven to be a valuable tool to quantify quantum steering. However, the challenge lies in the fact that the optimal measurement strategy is not priori known, making it time-consuming to compute the steerable measure for any given quantum state. Furthermore, the utilization of SDP requires full information of the quantum state, necessitating quantum state tomography, which can be complex and resource-consuming. In this work, we utilize the semi-supervised self-training model to estimate the steerable weight, a pivotal measure of quantum steering. The model can be trained using a limited amount of labeled data, thus reducing the time for labeling. The features are constructed by the probabilities derived by performing three sets of projective measurements under arbitrary local unitary transformations on the target states, circumventing the need for quantum tomography. The model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities and can achieve high levels of precision with limited resources.</description>

      <title>Phase-Amplitude Representation of Continuum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical method of solving the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for the regular and irregular continuum states using the phase-amplitude representation is presented. Our solution acquires the correct Dirac-delta normalization by wisely enforcing the amplitude and phase boundary values. Our numerical test involving point-wise relative errors with the known Coulomb functions shows that the present method approximates both the regular and irregular wavefunctions with similar, excellent accuracy. This is done by using new basis polynomials that, among other advantages, can elegantly enforce the derivative continuity of any order. The current phase-amplitude method is implemented here to study the continuum states of Coulomb-screened potentials. We discovered that, during the parametric transition from a Hydrogen atom to the Yukawa potential, the electronic density at the origin exhibits surprising oscillation -- a phenomenon apparently unique to the continuum states.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation in optimized circuits for particle-density correlations in real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing gives direct access to the study of real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In principle, it is possible to directly calculate non-equal-time correlation functions, from which one can detect interesting phenomena, such as the presence of quantum scars or dynamical quantum phase transitions. In practice, these calculations are strongly affected by noise, due to the complexity of the required quantum circuits. As a testbed for the evaluation of real-time evolution of observables and correlations, the dynamics of the Zn Schwinger model in a one dimensional lattice is considered. To control the computational cost, we adopt a quantum-classical strategy that reduces the dimensionality of the system by restricting the dynamics to the Dirac vacuum sector and optimizes the embedding into a qubit model by minimizing the number of three-qubit gates. We derive a digital circuit implementation of the time-evolution of particle-density correlation operators and their correlation, comparing results from exact evolution, bare noisy simulations and simulations with different error mitigation techniques. For the evolution of the particle-density operators we also perform runs on a physical IBM quantum device.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive Rydberg-atom interferometry with Floquet electromagnetically induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a phase-sensitive Rydberg-atom interferometry by implementing Floquet electromagnetically induced transparency (FEIT). The FEIT mixes the sidebands of a Rydberg state induced by a MHz radio frequency (RF) field and recombines them into FEIT bands. The FEIT bands act as screens to present the interference between paths with different phases, which are transitions between the sidebands and excited states. This interferometry can measure the phase of a MHz RF field without a local RF reference field. A phase reference is supplied to the atoms via a periodic electrical signal in the FEIT. We demonstrate that the MHz RF phase is measured over a full range of $2\pi$, and $10^{-4}$ rad accuracy is achieved. Moreover, the RF amplitude can also be measured with higher accuracy than the traditional EIT-based scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum network is a network of entangled states and can be used to transmit quantum information. Non-maximally entangled states are not really effective in establishing quantum communication across vast distances. Creating and maintaining a maximally entangled state (over which quantum information is transferred more effectively) is difficult in experiments, as typically non-maximally entangled states are produced therein. Therefore, we usually construct a network of non-maximally entangled states and use the underlying network structure to establish maximal entanglement between distant nodes. Various protocols leveraging interesting aspects of quantum and statistical physics are designed to achieve long-range maximally entangled states. Herein, we consider two-dimensional lattices as quantum networks where edges represent non-maximally entangled pure states. We introduce a new protocol based on bond percolation -- general concurrence percolation (GCP) -- to create a network of maximally entangled states. The associated network obtained through GCP ought to enable the achievement of long-range quantum communication. Similar to other existing protocols, our observations indicate that GCP falls within the percolation universality class, as determined through finite-size scaling analysis performed on two-dimensional lattices. We find that the associated percolation threshold value is smaller than that of existing protocols.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reconciliation of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Multiplicatively Repeated Non-Binary LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution bears the promise of simple quantum key distribution directly compatible with commercial off the shelf equipment. However, for a long time its performance was hindered by the absence of good classical postprocessing capable of distilling secret-keys in the noisy regime. Advanced coding solutions in the past years have partially addressed this problem enabling record transmission distances of up to 165 km, and 206 km over ultra-low loss fiber. In this paper, we show that a very simple coding solution with a single code is sufficient to extract keys at all noise levels. This solution has performance competitive with prior results for all levels of noise, and we show that non-zero keys can be distilled up to a record distance of 192 km assuming the standard loss of a single-mode optical fiber, and 240 km over ultra-low loss fibers. Low-rate codes are constructed using multiplicatively repeated non-binary low-density parity-check codes over a finite field of characteristic two. This construction only makes use of a (2,k)-regular non-binary low-density parity-check code as mother code, such that code design is in fact not required, thus trivializing the code construction procedure. The construction is also inherently rate-adaptive thereby allowing to easily create codes of any rate. Rate-adaptive codes are of special interest for the efficient reconciliation of errors over time or arbitrary varying channels, as is the case with quantum key distribution. In short, these codes are highly efficient when reconciling errors over a very noisy communication channel, and perform well even for short block-length codes. Finally, the proposed solution is known to be easily amenable to hardware implementations, thus addressing also the requirements for practical reconciliation in continuous variable quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Preserving and Preparing Coherent States in V-type Atom in Dissipative Cavity under Detuning and Weak Measurement Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the quantum coherence of a V-type atom in a dissipative cavity under detuning and weak measurement reversal is studied using methods such as the Fano theorem, the Schrodinger equation and the l1 norm of coherence. The atomic density operator is derived, and the coherences of different initial states are investigated in detail under parameters including spontaneously generated interference (SGI), atom-reservoir coupling, weak measurement reversal and detuning between the atom and the cavity. The results indicate that, the strong coupling can induce coherence sudden death (CSD) and coherence sudden birth (CSB), and the non-zero SGI parameter only induces CSB but the detuning may avoid CSD and CSB. Moreover, both detuning and weak measurement reversal have positive effects on protecting and generating quantum coherence, but the weak measurement has a negative effect. The non-zero SGI parameter has positive effects on declining and generating of quantum coherence. In particular, the maximal coherent state can be very effectively protected and the coherent state can be prepared if all parameters are selected appropriately. Physical interpretations are also provided for these results.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement--induced bistability in a magnetic resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi--stability in the response of a ferrimagnetic spin resonator to an externally applied driving is experimentally studied. The observed multi--stability cannot be derived from any master equation that linearly depends on the spins' reduced density operator. Traditionally, the nonlinearity that is required in order to theoretically account for the observed multi--stability is introduced by implementing the method of Bosonization. Here, an alternative explanation, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems is explored. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a master equation having an added nonlinear term, which deterministically generates disentanglement. Experimental results are compared with predictions derived from both competing theoretical models. It is found that better agreement with data is obtained from the disentanglement--based model. This finding, together with a difficulty to justify the Bosonization--based model, indirectly support the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropic Quantum Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of generalized entropic quantum speed limits based on $\alpha$-$z$-R\'{e}nyi relative entropy, a real-valued, contractive, two-parameter family of distinguishability measures. The QSL falls into the class of \`{a} la Mandelstam-Tamm bounds, and applies to finite-dimensional quantum systems that undergo general physical process, i.e., their effective dynamics can be modeled by unitary or nonunitary evolutions. The results cover pure or mixed, separable and entangled probe quantum states. The QSL time depends on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of probe and instantaneous states of the system, and its evaluation requires low computational cost. In addition, it is inversely proportional to the time-average of the Schatten speed of the instantaneous state, which in turn is fully characterized by the considered dynamics. We specialize our results to the case of unitary and nonunitary evolutions. In the former case, the QSL scales with the inverse of the energy fluctuations, while the latter depends on the operator norm of the rate of change of the quantum channel Kraus operators. We illustrate our findings for single-qubit and two-qubit states evolving under depolarizing and amplitude damping channels, respectively. Our results may find applications in the study of entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, and also entanglement entropies signaled by generalized entropies.</description>

      <title>Reproducing EPR correlations without superluminal signalling: backward conditional probabilities and Statistical Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's theorem states that no model that respects Local Causality and Statistical Independence can account for the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics via entangled states. This paper proposes a new approach, using backward-in-time conditional probabilities, which relaxes conventional assumptions of temporal ordering while preserving Statistical Independence as a "fine-tuning condition. It is shown how such models can account for EPR/Bell correlations and, analogously, the GHZ predictions while nevertheless forbidding superluminal signalling.</description>

      <title>Entropy and singular-value moments of products of truncated random unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Products of truncated unitary matrices, independently and uniformly drawn from the unitary group, can be used to study universal aspects of monitored quantum circuits. The von Neumann entropy of the corresponding density matrix decreases with increasing length $L$ of the product chain, in a way that depends on the matrix dimension $N$ and the truncation depth $\delta N$. Here we study that dependence in the double-scaling limit $L,N\rightarrow\infty$, at fixed ratio $\tau=L\delta N/N$. The entropy reduction crosses over from a linear to a logarithmic dependence on $\tau$ when this parameter crosses unity. The central technical result is an expression for the singular-value moments of the matrix product in terms of the Erlang function from queueing theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the classical aspects of Quantum theory and under which description Quantum theory does appear Classical. Although such descriptions or variables are known as "ontological" or "hidden", they are not hidden at all, but are dual classical states (in the sense of the general classical-quantum duality of Nature). The application of the Minimal Group Representation immediately classicalizes the system, Mp(2) emerging as the group of the classical-quantum duality symmetry. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Explicit near-optimal quantum algorithm for solving the advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit near-optimal quantum algorithm is proposed for modeling dissipative initial-value problems. This method, based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations (LCHS), approximates a target nonunitary operator as a weighted sum of Hamiltonian evolutions, thereby emulating a dissipative problem by mixing various time scales. We propose an efficient encoding of this algorithm into a quantum circuit based on a simple coordinate transformation that turns the dependence on the summation index into a trigonometric function and significantly simplifies block-encoding. The resulting circuit has high success probability and scales logarithmically with the number of terms in the LCHS sum and linearly with time. We verify the quantum circuit and its scaling by simulating it on a digital emulator of fault-tolerant quantum computers and, as a test problem, solve the advection-diffusion equation. The proposed algorithm can be used for modeling a wide class of nonunitary initial-value problems including the Liouville equation and linear embeddings of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Nuclear Electric Resonance as Single Qubit Gate for Trapped Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$ $^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$ 5s5p $^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be surpassed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of quantum concepts is increasingly making its way into generative machine learning models. However, while there are various implementations of quantum Generative Adversarial Networks, the integration of quantum elements into diffusion models remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose a potential version of a quantum diffusion model that leverages the established idea of classical latent diffusion models. This involves using a traditional autoencoder to reduce images, followed by operations with variational circuits in the latent space. To effectively assess the benefits brought by quantum computing, the images generated by the quantum latent diffusion model have been compared to those generated by a classical model with a similar number of parameters, evaluated in terms of quantitative metrics. The results demonstrate an advantage in using a quantum version, as evidenced by obtaining better metrics for the images generated by the quantum version compared to those obtained by the classical version. Furthermore, quantum models continue to outperform even when considering small percentages of the dataset for training, demonstrating the quantum's ability to extract features more effectively even in a few shot learning scenario.</description>

Abstract: Dynamics of icrocantilevers are of important interest in micro-mechanical systems for enhancing the functionality and applicable range of the cantilevers in vibration transducing and highly sensitive measurement. In this study, using the semi-classical Hamiltonian formalism, we study in detail the modification of the mechanical frequency and damping rate taking into account both the linear and quadratic coupling between the mechanical oscillator and the laser field in an opto-mechanical system. It has been seen that, the linear coupling greatly enhances the modification of the effective mechanical frequency and the effective damping rate while the quadratic coupling reduces these quantities. For a MHz-frequency oscillator, the damping rate could be 10^5 times increased and the frequency is several times modified. These results help clarifying the origin of the modification of the susceptibility function for cooling of the mechanical mode</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optomagnomechanical system, which involves flexible nonlinearities, is one of the promising physical platforms for studying the preparation and manipulation of quantum entanglements, as well as the construction of hybrid quantum networks. A scheme for entanglement enhancement and quadripartite entanglement generation is proposed, based on a cascaded optomagnomechanical system. On the one hand, optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements within the two subsystems are investigated, and their parameter dependence, such as detuning, decay, coupling strength, and transmission efficiency, is discussed. On the other hand, the parameter conditions for achieving optimal optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements are also obtained. The results show that significant enhancement of optomicrowave and optomagnonic entanglements in the second cavity can be obtained in a certain range of parameters. Under optimized parameter conditions, optomicrowave and optomagnonic quadripartite entanglements can be generated throughout the entire cascaded system. This research provides a theoretical basis for the manipulation of quantum entanglement, the transmission of the magnon's state, and the construction of hybrid quantum networks involving different physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems, in which the coupling between an optical field and a mechanical resonator is described by linear, quadratic, and cubic terms in mechanical displacements, are studied. It is shown that under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the cavity field, the dynamics of the mechanical resonator is determined by some effective, generally bistable, potential. The shape of this potential depends on the power of the optical driving field, detuning between the cavity and driving frequencies, the parameters of nonlinear optomechanical interactions and the decay rate of the cavity field. Examples of both periodic and chaotic behavior of the mechanical resonator are illustrated by determining the power spectrum of mechanical oscillations, constructing the corresponding phase portraits and Poincar\'{e} maps.</description>

Abstract: High-precision sensors are of fundamental importance in modern society and technology.Although numerous sensors have been developed, obtaining sensors with higher levels of sensitivity and stronger robustness has always been expected. Here, we propose theoretically and demonstrate experimentally a novel class of sensors with superior performances based on exotic properties of highorder non-Hermitian topological physics. The frequency shift induced by perturbations for these sensors can show an exponential growth with respect to the size of the device, which can well beyond the limitations of conventional sensors. The fully integrated circuit chips have been designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology. The sensitivity of systems not only less than 0.001fF has been experimentally verified, they are also robust against disorders.Our proposed ultra-sensitive integrated circuit sensors can possess a wide range of applications in various fields and show an exciting prospect for next-generation sensing technologies.</description>

Abstract: The quantum no-broadcasting theorem states that it is fundamentally impossible to perfectly replicate an arbitrary quantum state, even if correlations between the copies are allowed. While quantum broadcasting cannot occur through any physical process, it can be realized virtually through a process called virtual quantum broadcasting (VQB), which is described by a Hermitian-preserving and trace-preserving map. In this work, we first leverage the concept of the linear combination of unitaries and design a quantum circuit integrated with a post-processing protocol to implement VQB and demonstrate it in a nuclear magnetic resonance system. Then, we experimentally verify the closest physical map, known as the optimal quantum cloner, to the virtual broadcasting map, by comparing the trace distance between Choi states of the VQB map and a given set of physical maps. Finally, we identify the difference in statistical outcomes between the input of the optimal quantum cloner and its local output as the fundamental error imposed by quantum mechanics and show how VQB suppresses this error. Our method applies to quantum systems of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with reinforcement learning on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems (N&gt;12, where N is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems N&gt;10 compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work contributes to the advancement of a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for computations of thermal out-of-time-order correlators in quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity studies on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the joint distribution of magic ($M$) and entanglement ($S$) in $N$-qubit Haar-random quantum states. The distribution $P_N(M,S)$ as well as the marginals become exponentially localized, and centered around the values $\tilde{M_2} \to N-2$ and $\tilde{S} \to N/2$ as $N\to\infty$. Magic and entanglement fluctuations are, however, found to become exponentially uncorrelated. Although exponentially many states with magic $M_2=0$ and entropy $S\approx S_\text{Haar}$ exist, they represent an exponentially small fraction compared to typical quantum states, which are characterized by large magic and entanglement entropy, and uncorrelated magic and entanglement fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Optimization for Holevo Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the classical capacity of a noisy quantum channel is crucial for understanding the limits of communication over quantum channels. However, its evaluation remains challenging due to the difficulty of computing the Holevo capacity and the even greater difficulty of regularization. In this work, we formulate the computation of the Holevo capacity as an optimization problem on a product manifold constructed from probability distributions and their corresponding pure input states for a quantum channel. A Riemannian gradient descent algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, providing lower bounds on the classical capacity of general quantum channels and outperforming existing methods in numerical experiments in both efficiency and scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three possible extensions of the bit-flip channel to qutrit systems based on the diverse interpretations of the channel. Also, we extended them to higher-dimensional qudit systems, formulating different versions of dit flip channels. Finally, we studied their impact on the Negativity, as an entanglement measure, of qubit-qutrit and 2-qutrit Werner states. In doing so, we showed the inequivalence of these versions as they affect in very distinct ways the states entanglement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of the quantum Zeno effect (QZE) for the preparation of non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems. By frequently monitoring the system, the QZE can suppress transitions away from desired subspaces of states. We show that this enables the preparation of states in qubit subspaces even in the presence of noise and decoherence. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate that QZE-based protocols can significantly improve the robustness of state preparation of qubit states in continuous variable architectures. Our results extend the utility of the QZE beyond discrete systems, highlighting its potential for enhancing quantum control in more complex quantum information processing environments. These findings offer a promising approach for achieving reliable non-Gaussian states in optomechanical systems, with implications for the development of photonic quantum computing and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum transistors for heat flux in and out of working substance parts: harmonic vs transmon and Kerr environs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermal transistors have been widely studied in the context of three-qubit systems, where each qubit interacts separately with a Markovian harmonic bath. Markovianity is an assumption that is imposed on a system if the environment loses its memory within short while, while non-Markovianity is a general feature, inherently present in a large fraction of realistic scenarios. Instead of Markovian environments, here we propose a transistor in which the interaction between the working substance and an environment comprising of an infinite chain of qutrits is based on periodic collisions. We refer to the device as a working-substance thermal transistor, since the model focuses on heat currents flowing in and out of each individual qubit of the working substance to and from different parts of the system and environment. We find that the transistor effect prevails in this apparatus and we depict how the amplification of heat currents depends on the temperature of the modulating environment, the system-environment coupling strength and the interaction time. We further show that there exists a non-zero amplification even if one of the environments, that is not the modulating one, is detached from the system. Additionally, the environment, being comprised of three-level systems, allows us to consider the effects of frail perturbations in the energy-spacings of the qutrit, leading to a non-linearity in the environment. We consider non-linearities that are either of transmon- or of Kerr-type. We find parameter ranges where there is a significant amplification for both transmon- and Kerr-type non-linearities in the environment. Finally, we detect the non-Markovianity induced in the system from a non-monotonic behavior of the amplification observed with respect to time, and quantify it using the distinguishability-based measure of non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Two fundamental solutions to the rigid Kochen-Specker set problem and the solution to the minimal Kochen-Specker set problem under one assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results show that Kochen-Specker (KS) sets of observables are fundamental to quantum information, computation, and foundations beyond previous expectations. Among KS sets, those that are unique up to unitary transformations (i.e., ``rigid'') are especially important. The problem is that we do not know any rigid KS set in $\mathbb{C}^3$, the smallest quantum system that allows for KS sets. Moreover, none of the existing methods for constructing KS sets leads to rigid KS sets in $\mathbb{C}^3$. Here, we show that two fundamental structures of quantum theory define two rigid KS sets. One of these structures is the super-symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measure. The other is the minimal state-independent contextuality set. The second construction provides a clue to solve the minimal KS problem, the most important open problem in this field. We prove that the smallest rigid KS set that contains the minimal complete state-independent contextuality set has 31 observables. We conjecture that this is the solution to the minimal KS set problem.</description>

      <title>Squeezing generation crossing a mean-field critical point: Work statistics, irreversibility and critical fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical consequences of quantum phase transitions on thermodynamical quantities, such as work statistics and entropy production, is one of the most intriguing aspect of quantum many-body systems, pinpointing the emergence of irreversibility to critical features. In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to spatially extended systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence.</description>

      <title>Highly-entangled, highly-doped states that are efficiently cross-device verifiable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of highly entangled real quantum states that cannot be approximated by circuits with $\log$-many non-Clifford gates and prove that Bell sampling enables efficient cross-device verification (or distributed inner product estimation) for these states. That is, two remote parties can estimate the inner product ${\rm tr}(\rho\sigma)$, each having black-box access to copies of a state $\rho$ (or respectively $\sigma$) in this class. This is significant because it is clear that this task can be achieved in those cases (such as low entanglement or low non-Clifford gate count) where one can independently learn efficient classical descriptions of each state using established techniques and share the description to compute the overlap. Instead, our results demonstrate that this is possible even in more complex scenarios where these "learn and share" methods are insufficient. Our proposal is scalable, as it just requires a number of two-copy Bell measurements and single-copy Pauli measurements that grows polynomially with both the number of qubits and the desired inverse-error, and can be implemented in the near term. Moreover, the required number of samples can be efficiently experimentally determined by the parties in advance, and our findings are robust against preparation errors. We anticipate that these results could have applications in quantum cryptography and verification.</description>

      <title>Solving Constrained Optimization Problems Using Hybrid Qubit-Qumode Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization challenges span a wide array of fields, from logistics and scheduling to finance, materials science, and drug discovery. Among these, Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are especially significant due to their computational complexity and their potential as a key application for quantum computing. In this work, we introduce an approach for solving QUBO problems using hybrid qubit-qumode bosonic quantum computers$\unicode{x2014}$devices that manipulate and measure the quantum states of light within microwave cavity resonators. We map problems with soft and hard constraints onto the Hamiltonian of a hybrid quantum system, consisting of a single qubit coupled to multiple qumodes. The optimal solution is encoded in the ground state of the system, which is revealed by photon-number measurements. Trial states are prepared through universal qubit-qumode circuits, employing echoed conditional displacement (ECD) gates in combination with qubit rotations. Our approach demonstrates the immense potential of hybrid quantum systems, showcasing their ability to efficiently tackle complex optimization problems in both academia and industry.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a quantum communication protocol via 2-step discrete time quantum walks with two coins on a graph of 10 vertices containing both cycles and paths. Quantum walks are known for their ability to integrate quantum mechanics dynamics like superposition and entanglement during the procedure. We calculate the total final quantum state of the system as well as the recovery operators to rescue the initial quantum state back at the receiver's location. Our work provides a fundamental block for a quantum teleportation scheme on a specific series of cycle and path graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computers require highly specialized and stable environments to operate, expanding their capabilities within a single system presents significant technical challenges. By interconnecting multiple quantum processors, distributed quantum computing can facilitate the execution of more complex and larger-scale quantum algorithms. End-to-end heuristics for the distribution of quantum circuits have been developed so far. In this work, we derive an exact integer programming approach for the Distributed Quantum Circuit (DQC) problem, assuming fixed module allocations. Since every DQC algorithm necessarily yields a module allocation function, our formulation can be integrated with it as a post-processing step. This improves on the hypergraph partitioning formulation, which finds a module allocation function and an efficient distribution at once. We also show that a suboptimal heuristic to find good allocations can outperform previous methods. In particular, for quantum Fourier transform circuits, we conjecture from experiments that the optimal module allocation is the trivial one found by this method.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a noncommutative version of the Nullstellensatz, motivated by the study of quantum nonlocal games. It has been proved that a two-answer nonlocal game with a perfect quantum strategy also admits a perfect classical strategy. We generalize this result to the infinite-dimensional case, showing that a two-answer game with a perfect commuting operator strategy also admits a perfect classical strategy. This result induces a special case of noncommutative Nullstellensatz.</description>

      <title>Geometrical scheduling of adiabatic control without information of energy spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic control is a fundamental technique for manipulating quantum systems, guided by the quantum adiabatic theorem, which ensures suppressed nonadiabatic transitions under slow parameter variations. Quantum annealing, a heuristic algorithm leveraging adiabatic control, seeks the ground states of Ising spin glass models and has drawn attention for addressing combinatorial optimization problems. However, exponentially small energy gaps in such models often necessitate impractically long runtime to satisfy the adiabatic condition. Despite this limitation, improving the quality of approximate solutions remains crucial for practical applications. The quantum adiabatic brachistochrone provides a method to enhance adiabaticity by minimizing an action representing nonadiabaticity via the variational principle. While effective, its implementation requires detailed energy spectra, complicating its use in quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity by counterdiabatic driving offer alternative approaches for accelerating adiabatic processes. However, the theory of shortcuts to adiabaticity often faces challenges such as nonlocal control requirements, high computational cost, and trade-offs between speed and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel quantum adiabatic brachistochrone protocol tailored for quantum annealing that eliminates the need for energy spectrum information. Our approach builds on advancements in counterdiabatic driving to design efficient parameter schedules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical simulations on the transverse-field Ising chain and axial next-nearest neighbor Ising models.</description>

      <title>Two-photon Interference of Biphotons Emitted by Overlapping Resonances in Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon interference, a quantum phenomenon arising from the principle of indistinguishability, is a powerful tool for quantum state engineering and plays a fundamental role in various quantum technologies. These technologies demand robust and efficient sources of quantum light, as well as scalable, integrable and multifunctional platforms. In this regard, quantum optical metasurfaces (QOMs) are emerging as promising platforms for quantum light generation, namely biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), and its engineering. Due to the relaxation of phase matching, SPDC in QOMs allows different channels of biphoton generation, such as those supported by overlapping resonances, to occur simultaneously. In previously reported QOMs, however, SPDC was too weak to observe such effects. Here we develop QOMs based on [110]-oriented GaAs that provide more than an order of magnitude enhancement in SPDC rate, after accounting for the spectral bandwidth, compared to any other QOMs studied to date. This boosted efficiency allows the QOMs support the simultaneous generation of SPDC from several spectrally overlapping optical modes. Using polarization components in the interferometer analyzer, we intentionally erase the distinguishability between the biphotons from a high-$Q$ quasi-bound-state-in-the-continuum resonance and a low-$Q$ Mie resonance, which results in the first-time observation of two-photon interference in the spectral domain in these types of devices. This quantum interference can considerably enrich the generation of entangled photons in metasurfaces. Their advanced multifunctionality, improved nonlinear response, ease of fabrication and compact footprint of [110]-GaAs QOMs position them as promising platforms to fulfill the requirements for photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Schawlow-Townes Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of a feedback oscillators realized by a phase-insensitive amplifier in positive feedback, where either the amplifier or the feedback element may determine the oscillator's linewidth. The spectral purity of the output of such a device originates from basic demands of quantum mechanics and causality. The resulting expression generalizes the Schawlow-Townes limit, which is itself one component of a standard quantum limit for feedback oscillators. Recently realized bad-cavity oscillators such as super-radiant lasers and solid-state masers can saturate this generalized Schawlow-Townes limit. This limit can be surpassed through appropriate quantum engineering: for example by atomic spin squeezing in a super-radiant laser.</description>

      <title>Probing negative differential resistance in silicon with a P-I-N diode-integrated T center ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The T center in silicon has recently emerged as a promising candidate for scalable quantum technologies, due to its telecommunications band optical transition and microwave addressable ground state spin. The immense promise of the T center is driven by its silicon host material; silicon is by far the most mature, manufacturable semiconductor material for integrated photonic and electronic devices. Here, we present the first study of T-centers in an electrical device. We study an ensemble of T centers coupled to a buried lateral P-I-N diode in silicon, observing the T-center's optical response to static and dynamic electric fields. We utilize the defect's optical response as a probe of device nonlinearity, observing a phase transition of the carrier density into a stable oscillatory regime characteristic of negative differential resistance. These findings provide fundamental insight into the physics of the T-center for improved quantum device performance and open a promising new direction for defect-based local quantum sensing in semiconductor devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed the fabrication of large arrays of coupled qubits serving as prototypes of quantum processors. However, the optimal control of such systems is notoriously hard, which limits the potential of large-scale quantum systems. Here, we investigate a model problem of quantum state transfer in a large nearest-neighbor-coupled qubit array and derive an optimal control that simultaneously enables maximal fidelity and minimal time of the transfer.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian $k$-Locality is the Key Resource for Powerful Quantum Battery Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Storing and extracting energy using quantum degrees of freedom is a promising approach to leveraging quantum effects in energy science. Early experimental efforts have already demonstrated its potential to surpass the charging power of existing technologies. In this context, it is crucial to identify the specific quantum effects that can be exploited to design the most efficient quantum batteries and push their performance to the ultimate limit. While entanglement has often been considered a key factor in enhancing charging (or discharging) power, our findings reveal that it is not as critical as previously thought. Instead, three parameters emerge as the most significant in determining the upper bound of instantaneous charging power: the locality of the battery and charger Hamiltonians, and the maximum energy storable in a single unit cell of the battery. To derive this new bound, we have also addressed several open questions previously noted in the literature but lacks an explanation. This bound provides a foundation for designing the most powerful charger-battery systems, where combined optimization of both components offers enhancements that cannot be achieved by manipulating only one of them.</description>

      <title>Quantum First-Order Logics That Capture Logarithmic-Time/Space Quantum Computability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum analogue of classical first-order logic (FO) and develop a theory of quantum first-order logic as a basis of the productive discussions on the power of logical expressiveness toward quantum computing. The purpose of this work is to logically express "quantum computation" by introducing specially-featured quantum connectives and quantum quantifiers that quantify fixed-dimensional quantum states. Our approach is founded on the recently introduced recursion-theoretical schematic definitions of time-bounded quantum functions, which map finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces to themselves. The quantum first-order logic (QFO) in this work therefore looks quite different from the well-known old concept of quantum logic based on lattice theory. We demonstrate that quantum first-order logics possess an ability of expressing bounded-error quantum logarithmic-time computability by the use of new "functional" quantum variables. In contrast, an extra inclusion of quantum transitive closure operator helps us characterize quantum logarithmic-space computability. The same computability can be achieved by the use of different "functional" quantum variables.</description>

      <title>Cluster property and Bell's inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the many loopholes that might be invoked to reconcile local realism with the experimental violations of Bell's inequalities, the space-dependence of the correlation functions appears particularly relevant for its connections with the so-called cluster property, one of the basic ingredient of axiomatic quantum field theory. The property states that the expectation values of products of observables supported within space-like separated space-time regions factorize. Actually, in some massive models the factorization is exponentially fast with respect to the distance between the systems possibly involved in actual experiments. It is then often argued that considering the space dependence of the quantities involved in the Bell's like inequalities would eventually not violate them and thus support the reproducibility of the quantum behaviour by a suitable local hidden variable model. In this note, we show when this is actually the case and how non-local effects can still be visible.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Coherent-One-Way QKD Simulation Framework for 6G Networks: Bridging Theory and Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has been emerged as a promising solution for guaranteeing information-theoretic security. Inspired by this, a great amount of research effort has been recently put on designing and testing QKD systems as well as articulating preliminary application scenarios. However, due to the considerable high-cost of QKD equipment, a lack of QKD communication system design tools, wide deployment of such systems and networks is challenging. Motivated by this, this paper introduces a QKD communication system design tool. First we articulate key operation elements of the QKD, and explain the feasibility and applicability of coherent-one-way (COW) QKD solutions. Next, we focus on documenting the corresponding simulation framework as well as defining the key performance metrics, i.e., quantum bit error rate (QBER), and secrecy key rate. To verify the accuracy of the simulation framework, we design and deploy a real-world QKD setup. We perform extensive experiments for three deployments of diverse transmission distance in the presence or absence of a QKD eavesdropper. The results reveal an acceptable match between simulations and experiments rendering the simulation framework a suitable tool for QKD communication system design.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved spectral diffusion of a multimode mechanical memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency phonons hold great promise as carriers of quantum information on-chip and as quantum memories. Due to their coherent interaction with several systems, their compact mode volume and slow group velocity, multiple experiments have recently demonstrated coherent transport of information on-chip using phonon modes, interconnecting distinct quantum devices. Strongly confined phonons in waveguide-like geometries are particularly interesting because of their long lifetime. However, spectral diffusion has been observed to substantially limit their coherence times. Coupling to two-level systems is suspected to be a major contributor to the diffusion, however, to date, the origin and underlying mechanisms are however still not fully understood. Here, we perform a time-domain study on two adjacent mechanical modes (separated by around 5 MHz) and show that the frequency positions of the two modes are not correlated in time, in agreement with our theoretical model and Monte-Carlo simulations. This result is an important step in fully understanding the microscopic mechanisms of dephasing in mechanical quantum buses and memories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics of Dissipative Polarizable Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. Exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyze the fault tolerance of $[[6,1,3]]$ non-CSS quantum error correcting code under the anisotropic and depolarizing noise models. This rate-optimized code achieves fault-tolerance using a single ancilla qubit for syndrome measurement under anisotropic noise conditions. This method was called fault-tolerance using bare ancilla by Brown \emph{et al.} We give explicit construction of the code using measurements on non-planar graph states. We also argue that using our approach, we can construct a family of such fault-tolerant codes. This method fills a notable gap in constructing fault-tolerant non-CSS code families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the emergence of quantum computing, the subsequent quantum revolution will be that of interconnecting individual quantum computers at global level. In the same way that classical computers only realised their full potential with the emergence of the internet, a fully realised quantum internet is the net stage of evolution for quantum computation. This work examines in detail how the quantum internet would evolve in practice, focusing not only on the technology itself but also on the implications it will have economically and politically. We present both original ideas, as well as an extensive review of relevant and related background material. This work begins with a description of classical networks before introducing the key concepts behind quantum networks, such as quantum internet protocols, quantum cryptography, and cloud quantum computing. The work is divided into technical sections (requiring only a basic knowledge of the notation of quantum mechanics), for those interested in mathematical details, as well as non-technical sections for those seeking a more general understanding. We target this work very broadly at quantum and classical computer scientists, classical computer systems, software and network engineers, physicists, economists, artists, musicians, and those just generally curious about the future of quantum technologies and what they might bring to humanity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have gained prominence in variational quantum Monte Carlo methods in approximating ground-state wavefunctions. Despite their success, they face limitations in optimization, scalability, and expressivity in addressing certain problems. In this work, we propose a quantum-neural hybrid framework that combines parameterized quantum circuits with neural networks to model quantum many-body wavefunctions. This approach combines the efficient sampling and optimization capabilities of autoregressive neural networks with the enhanced expressivity provided by quantum circuits. Numerical simulations demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of the hybrid ansatz in spin systems and quantum chemistry problems. Our results reveal that the hybrid method achieves notably lower relative energy compared to standalone NQS. These findings underscore the potential of quantum-neural hybrid methods for tackling challenging problems in quantum many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo scheme for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) with any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as a ratio of generalized partition functions, we prove that it can be simulated by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space. This allows for straightforward computation of the values and derivatives of $\alpha$-SRE using techniques such as reweight-annealing and thermodynamic integration. Moreover, our approach separates the free energy contribution in $\alpha$-SRE, thus the contribution solely from the characteristic function can be studied, which is directly tied to magic. In our applications to the ground states of 1D and 2D transverse field Ising (TFI) model, we reveal that the behavior of $2$-SRE is governed by the interplay between the characteristic function and the free energy contributions, with singularities hidden in both of their derivatives at quantum critical points. This indicates that $\alpha$-SRE does not necessarily exhibit a peak at the quantum critical point for a general many-body system. We also study the volume-law corrections to the ground-state magic. These corrections slightly violate the strict volume law and suggest discontinuity at quantum critical points, which we attribute to the abrupt change of the ground-state magical structure. Our findings suggest that volume-law corrections of magic are stronger diagnostics for criticalities than the full-state magic. Lastly, we study the finite-temperature phase transition of the 2D TFI model, where the $2$-SRE is not a well-defined magic measure. The nonphysical results we obtain also prove the ineffectiveness of $2$-SRE for mixed states. Our method enables scalable and efficient evaluation of $\alpha$-SRE in large-scale quantum systems, providing a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of tensor networks (TNs) to the simulation of material deformations within the framework of linear elasticity. Material simulations are essential computational tools extensively used in both academic research and industrial applications. TNs, originally developed in quantum mechanics, have recently shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms. Our study successfully employs TNs to solve linear elasticity equations with billions of degrees of freedom, achieving exponential reductions in both memory usage and computational time. These results demonstrate the practical viability of TNs as a powerful classical backend for executing quantum-inspired algorithms with significant efficiency gains. This work is based on our research conducted with IKERLAN.</description>

      <title>State Transfer in Latent-Symmetric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of quantum states is a crucial aspect of information processing systems, facilitating operations such as quantum key distribution and inter-component communication within quantum computers. Most quantum networks rely on symmetries to achieve an efficient state transfer. A straightforward way to design such networks is to use spatial symmetries, which severely limits the design space. Our work takes a novel approach to designing photonic networks that do not exhibit any conventional spatial symmetries, yet nevertheless support an efficient transfer of quantum states. Paradoxically, while a perfect transfer efficiency is technically unattainable in these networks, a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity is always reached within a finite time of evolution. Key to this approach are so-called latent, or 'hidden', symmetries, which are embodied in the spectral properties of the network. Latent symmetries substantially expand the design space of quantum networks and hold significant potential for applications in quantum cryptography and secure state transfer. We experimentally realize such a nine-site latent-symmetric network and successfully observe state transfer between two sites with a measured fidelity of 75%. Furthermore, by launching a two-photon state, we show that quantum interference is preserved by the network. This demonstrates that the latent symmetries enable efficient quantum state transfer, while offering greater flexibility in designing quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: Decoherence is a manifestation of the coupling of a system with its environment. The resulting loss of information can hamper the functioning of quantum devices, hence the need of understanding its origin and dynamics. Decoherence can stem from entanglement, but it can also be classical in nature. Indeed, methods have been developed to understand whether qubit-environment entanglement (QEE) is actually present in some important classes of quantum channels - pure dephasing. Their practicality resides in the fact they only require accessing the system qubit. In this article we show an implementation of this technique in a photonic quantum channel simulator via a scheme that has been tailored to the system under study. By controlling the input state of the environment in our simulation, we can check the occurrence of qubit environment entanglement in simple, yet insightful test cases. Our results showcase the usefulness and experimental relevance of the QEE witnessing technique.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood-Dirac representation associated to the Fourier transform for finite abelian groups: positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) representations naturally associated to the Fourier transform of finite abelian groups $G$. We identify all pure KD-positive states and all KD-real observables for these KD representations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that all KD-positive states are convex combinations of pure KD-positive states. We prove that for $G=\Z_{d}$, with $d$ a prime power, this condition is satisfied. We provide examples of abelian groups where it is not. In those cases, the convex set of KD-positive states contains states outside the convex hull of the pure KD-positive states.</description>

      <title>Practical scheme for efficient distillation of GHZ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an efficient local operation and classical communication (LOCC) scheme for the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states from tripartite systems subjected to both coherent and incoherent errors. The proposed method employs an iterative process that applies a postselection-based non-linear transformation to increase the entanglement of 3-qubit states. In contrast to traditional distillation protocols that require an exponential number of initial states as a resource, our method achieves subexponential convergence towards a pure GHZ state. The proposed scheme is practical in the sense that it employs a small set of relatively simple unitary operations and projective measurements in the computational basis. We systematically develop a double-iteration protocol by providing a mathematical framework for the transformation processes involved, emphasizing the role of unitary operations in correcting arbitrary small errors in the initial states. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the protocol's ability to progressively eliminate noise and improve fidelity over subsequent iterations. Significantly, our protocol not only corrects for small arbitrary distortions in the GHZ states but also maintains operational simplicity, making it feasible for practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Noise avalanche and its quantum quenching in bosonic chains with random off-diagonal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we discuss a phenomenon of sharp increase in the photon number noise at initial stages of propagation in tight-binding bosonic chains with off-diagonal disorder. Such a "noise avalanche" occurs under classical coherent excitation of waveguides and leads to high super-thermal photon bunching. Additional classical excitation slows but cannot quench this noise avalanche. However, an additional single-photon excitation stops the avalanche.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random exchanges of energy arise naturally in stochastic systems. As a consequence, apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics can occur, as it holds true on average. Here we investigate the occurrence of these apparent violations -- termed free lunches -- in a quantum-classical system comprised of levitated nanoparticles exchanging energy via the Coulomb interaction. We consider different initial states for the quantum system, and how these exert work and fluctuations upon the classical particle affecting the probability of free lunches. With that, we initiate the study of hybrid quantum-classical systems through the lens of stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum inflation: quantum marginal problem constraints in the service of causal inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the problem of deciding, for a particular multipartite quantum state, whether or not it is realizable in a quantum network with a particular causal structure. This is a fully quantum version of what causal inference researchers refer to as the problem of causal discovery. In this work, we introduce a fully quantum version of the inflation technique for causal inference, which leverages the quantum marginal problem. We illustrate the utility of this method using a simple example: testing compatibility of tripartite quantum states with the quantum network known as the triangle scenario. We show, in particular, how the method yields a complete classification of pure three-qubit states into those that are and those that are not compatible with the triangle scenario. We also provide some illustrative examples involving mixed states and some where one or more of the systems is higher-dimensional. Finally, we examine the question of when the incompatibility of a multipartite quantum state with a causal structure can be inferred from the incompatibility of a joint probability distribution induced by implementing measurements on each subsystem.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compressive Sensing Meets Quantum Noise: A Practical Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressive sensing is a signal processing technique that enables the reconstruction of sparse signals from a limited number of measurements, leveraging the signal's inherent sparsity to facilitate efficient recovery. Recent works on the Quantum Compressive Sensing (QCS) architecture, a quantum data-driven approach to compressive sensing where the state of the tensor network is represented by a quantum state over a set of entangled qubits, have shown promise in advancing quantum data-driven methods for compressive sensing. However, the QCS framework has remained largely untested on quantum computing resources or in the presence of quantum noise. In this work, we present a practical implementation of QCS on Amazon Braket, utilizing the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) projection technique to assess the framework's capabilities under quantum noise. We outline the necessary modifications to the QCS framework for deployment on Amazon Braket, followed by results under four types of quantum noise. Finally, we discuss potential long-term directions aimed at unlocking the full potential of quantum compressive sensing for applications such as signal recovery and image processing.</description>

      <title>Measured Hockey-Stick Divergence and its Applications to Quantum Pufferfish Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hockey-stick divergence is a fundamental quantity characterizing several statistical privacy frameworks that ensure privacy for classical and quantum data. In such quantum privacy frameworks, the adversary is allowed to perform all possible measurements. However, in practice, there are typically limitations to the set of measurements that can be performed. To this end, here, we comprehensively analyze the measured hockey-stick divergence under several classes of practically relevant measurement classes. We prove several of its properties, including data processing and convexity. We show that it is efficiently computable by semi-definite programming for some classes of measurements and can be analytically evaluated for Werner and isotropic states. Notably, we show that the measured hockey-stick divergence characterizes optimal privacy parameters in the quantum pufferfish privacy framework. With this connection and the developed technical tools, we enable methods to quantify and audit privacy for several practically relevant settings. Lastly, we introduce the measured hockey-stick divergence of channels and explore its applications in ensuring privacy for channels.</description>

      <title>On the distinguishability of geometrically uniform quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometrically uniform (GU) ensemble is a uniformly weighted quantum state ensemble generated from a fixed state by a unitary representation of a finite group $G$. In this work we analyze the problem of discriminating GU ensembles from various angles. Assuming that the representation of $G$ is irreducible, we first give explicit expressions for the optimal success probability of discriminating the GU states, and optimal measurements achieving this value, in terms of the largest eigenvalue of the generator state and its associated eigenspace. A particular optimal measurement can be understood as the limit of weighted "pretty good measurements" (PGM). This naturally provides examples of state discrimination for which the unweighted PGM is provably sub-optimal. We extend this analysis to certain reducible representations, and use Schur-Weyl duality to discuss two particular examples of GU ensembles in terms of Werner-type and permutation-invariant generator states. For the case of pure-state GU ensembles we give a new streamlined proof of optimality of the PGM first proved in [Eldar et al., 2004]. We use this result to give a simplified proof of the optimality of the PGM for the hidden subgroup problem over semidirect product groups, along with an expression for the corresponding success probability, proved in [Bacon et al., 2005]. Finally, we consider the discrimination of generic mixed-state GU-ensembles in the $n$-copy setting and adapt a result of [Montanaro, 2007] to derive a compact and easily evaluated lower bound on the success probability of the PGM for this task. This result can be applied to the hidden subgroup problem to obtain a new proof for an upper bound on the sample complexity by [Hayashi et al., 2006].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Robust Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, denoising, and visualization. The most commonly used principal component analysis method is based upon optimization of the L2-norm, however, the L2-norm is known to exaggerate the contribution of errors and outliers. When optimizing over the L1-norm, the components generated are known to exhibit robustness or resistance to outliers in the data. The L1-norm components can be solved for with a binary optimization problem. Previously, L1-BF has been used to solve the binary optimization for multiple components simultaneously. In this paper we propose QAPCA, a new method for finding principal components using quantum annealing hardware which will optimize over the robust L1-norm. The conditions required for convergence of the annealing problem are discussed. The potential speedup when using quantum annealing is demonstrated through complexity analysis and experimental results. To showcase performance against classical principal component analysis techniques experiments upon synthetic Gaussian data, a fault detection scenario and breast cancer diagnostic data are studied. We find that the reconstruction error when using QAPCA is comparable to that when using L1-BF.</description>

      <title>Realization of tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in superconducting circuit lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac-like band crossings are paradigms in condensed matter systems to emulate high-energy physics phenomena. They are associated with two aspects: gap and tilting. The ability to design sign-changing gap gives rise to band topology, whereas the tilting of band crossings which is a gateway for large gravity-like effects remains uncharted. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform to realize tilted Dirac-like microwave cone in large-scale superconducting circuit lattices. The direction and magnitude of the tilt can be controlled by engineering the axially preferred second neighbor coupling. We demonstrate three lattices with 731-site LC resonator featuring tilt values of up to 59% of relative difference in the opposite-direction group velocities. This is obtained by reconstructing the density of states (DOS) of measured microwave resonance frequencies. Harnessing the tilt of Dirac-like band crossings lays the foundation for weaving the fabric of an emergent solid-state spacetime.</description>

      <title>Robust Hybrid Classical-Quantum Transfer Learning Model for Text Classification Using GPT-Neo 125M with LoRA &amp; SMOTE Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces a hybrid classical-quantum framework for text classification, integrating GPT-Neo 125M with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) using quantum computing backends. While the GPT-Neo 125M baseline remains the best-performing model, the implementation of LoRA and SMOTE enhances the hybrid model, resulting in improved accuracy, faster convergence, and better generalization. Experiments on IBM's 127-qubit quantum backend and Pennylane's 32-qubit simulation demonstrate the viability of combining classical neural networks with quantum circuits. This framework underscores the potential of hybrid architectures for advancing natural language processing applications.</description>

      <title>Poincare invariant interaction between two Dirac particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spinning electron-electron interaction is described in classical terms by means of two possible classical interactions: The instantaneous Coulomb interaction between the charge centers of both particles and the Poincar\'e invariant interaction developed in a previous work. The numerical integrations are performed with several Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested readers in the reference Section. One difference of these interactions is that the Poincar\'e invariant interaction does not satisfy the action-reaction principle in the synchronous description and, therefore, there is no conservation of the mechanical linear momentum. It is the total linear momentum of the system what is conserved.
  In this synchronous description the interaction is not mediated by the retarded fields but is described in terms of the instantaneous positions, velocities and accelerations of the center of charge of both particles. In the Poincar\'e invariant description the net binding force that holds linked two Dirac particles is stronger than in the Coulomb case, thus forming a stable spin 1 system of 2 Dirac particles. This bosonic state of spin 1 does not correspond to a Cooper pair because the separation between the centers of mass of the Dirac particles is below Compton's wavelength, smaller than the correlation distance of the Cooper pair. Since the Poincar\'e invariant interaction is relativistically invariant it can be used for analyzing high energy scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Improving Student Self-Efficacy in Quantum Computing with the Qubit Touchdown Board Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit Touchdown is a two-player, competitive board game that was developed to introduce students to quantum computing. A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that is based on the laws of quantum physics, and it can solve certain problems faster than normal computers because it follows a different set of rules. Qubit Touchdown's game play mirrors the rules of (American) football, with players taking turns moving the football to score the most touchdowns, and no knowledge of quantum computing is needed to play the game. We evaluated the game with 107 public high school students in Precalculus, Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics, and/or AP Physics 1 courses, assessing whether their interest in and self-efficacy toward quantum computing changed as a result of playing the game and learning about its connections to quantum computing. We also assessed whether the game was easy to learn and enjoyable. We found that students' self-efficacy was improved by 33.4%, and they widely considered the game accessible and fun.

      <description>arXiv:2501.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the status of the development of a responsible future quantum internet (QI). Through horizon scanning, domain expert trend analysis and guided workshops, we present a desired future (DF) conceptualized by stakeholders within the scope of the ethical, legal, societal aspects (ELSA) and policy implications (ELSPI) of the QI. We examine the alignment of the present situation and the DF of the QI ELSPI to the ideals of the 'ten principles for responsible quantum innovation' developed by [Mauritz Kop et al. 2024 Quantum Sci. Technol. 9 035013]. Most principles in the DF are well aligned to the ideal, except for the misalignment in 'intellectual property' (IP) and 'dual use', revealing the precarious balance of well intended policy suggestions and effective outcomes. Additionally, there is an overemphasis placed on the principal of societal relevance in the DF, risking overseeing other principles in the future steering of the ELSPI. The present situation is in moderate alignment with the principles, however trending to misalignment on IP and international collaboration due to QI commercialization and the push for geopolitical sovereignty. For continued success of a responsible quantum internet, we recommend further investigation on the prevention of dual use quantum internet applications, closer involvement of commercial entities in ELSPI ideation, continued recognition of base-layer technology research and stakeholder education on QI applications.</description>

      <title>Driving a Quantum Phase Transition at Arbitrary Rate: Exact solution of the Transverse-Field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the crossing of the quantum phase transition in the transverse-field Ising model after modulating the magnetic field at an arbitrary rate, exploring the critical dynamics from the slow to the sudden quench regime. We do so by analyzing the defect density, the complete kink number distribution, and its cumulants upon completion of a linearized quench. Our analysis relies on the diagonalization of the model using the standard Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations, along with the exact solution of the time evolution in each mode in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The free-fermion nature of the problem dictates that the kink number distribution is associated with independent and distinguishable Bernoulli variables, each with a success probability $p_k$. We employ a combination of convergent and asymptotic series expansions to characterize $p_k$ without restrictions on the driving rate. When the latter is approximated by the Landau-Zener formula, the kink density is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and higher-order cumulants follow a universal power-law behavior, as recently predicted theoretically and verified in the laboratory. By contrast, for moderate and sudden driving protocols, the cumulants exhibit a nonuniversal behavior that is not monotonic on the driving rate and changes qualitatively with the cumulant order. The kink number statistics remain sub-Poissonian for any driving rate, as revealed by an analysis of the cumulant rations that vary nonmonotonically from the sudden to the slow-driving regime. Thanks to the determination of $p_k$ for an arbitrary rate, our study provides a complete analytical understanding of kink number statistics from the slow driving regime to the sudden quench limit.</description>

      <title>Frozonium: Freezing Anharmonicity in Floquet Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful method that can be used to modify the properties of interacting many-body Hamiltonians via the application of periodic time-dependent drives. Here we consider the physics of an inductively shunted superconducting Josephson junction in the presence of Floquet drives in the fluxonium regime and beyond, which we dub the frozonium artificial atom. We find that in the vicinity of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency, the many-body dynamics can be tuned to that of an effectively linear bosonic oscillator, with additional nonlinear corrections that are suppressed in higher powers of the drive frequency. By analyzing the inverse participation ratios between the time-evolved frozonium wavefunctions and the eigenbasis of a linear oscillator, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a novel dynamical control using a combination of numerical exact diagonalization and Floquet-Magnus expansion. We discuss the physics of resonances between quasi-energy states induced by the drive, and ways to mitigate their effects. We also highlight the enhanced protection of frozonium against external sources of noise present in experimental setups. This work lays the foundation for future applications in quantum memory and bosonic quantum control using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Matrix Ordering through Spectral and Nilpotent Structures in Totally Ordered Complex Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix inequalities play a pivotal role in mathematics, generalizing scalar inequalities and providing insights into linear operator structures. However, the widely used L\"owner ordering, which relies on real-valued eigenvalues, is limited to Hermitian matrices, restricting its applicability to non-Hermitian systems increasingly relevant in fields like non-Hermitian physics. To overcome this, we develop a total ordering relation for complex numbers, enabling comparisons of the spectral components of general matrices with complex eigenvalues. Building on this, we introduce the Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering (SNO), a partial order for arbitrary matrices of the same dimensions. We further establish a theoretical framework for majorization ordering with complex-valued functions, which aids in refining SNO and analyzing spectral components. An additional result is the extension of the Schur--Ostrowski criterion to the complex domain. Moreover, we characterize Jordan blocks of matrix functions using a generalized dominance order for nilpotent components, facilitating systematic analysis of non-diagonalizable matrices. Finally, we derive monotonicity and convexity conditions for functions under the SNO framework, laying a new mathematical foundation for advancing matrix analysis.</description>

      <title>Holographic thread game, kinematic space and quantum circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a holographic ``thread game", which visually represents quantum entanglement with thread-like objects, based on some natural assumptions. By studying their trajectories in the holographic bulk, we ultimately find that these threads should correspond precisely to perfect geodesics in the bulk, making kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing the thread game. Furthermore, it turns out that the thread game has a quantum circuit interpretation, where each thread plays the role of a wire. Therefore, kinematic space can be regarded as the ``input board" of the holographic quantum circuit characterizing the entanglement structure of the spacetime. Based on this understanding, we also present a nice explanation of holographic complexity in the language of kinematic space.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered InAs quantum dot (QD) arrays have been obtained on pre-patterned GaAs (0 0 1) substrates by atomic force microscopy (AFM) local oxidation nanolithography. Prior to InAs molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposition, an ordered square array of nanoholes is formed at the GaAs pre-patterned surface following in situ etching with atomic hydrogen. A low substrate temperature is maintained during the whole process in order to avoid pattern smoothing. Our results show that the density and dimensions of the nanoholes on the GaAs surface determine InAs QD size, nucleation site and InAs dose necessary for their formation. As a function of the geometrical parameters of the nanohole array, we can obtain either ordered 2D arrays of separated QD, closely packed QD or localized areas for QD formation.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Low-energy photoelectron structures for arbitrary ellipticity of a strong laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous attoclock experiments measuring the photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) via strong-field ionization in an elliptically polarized laser field have shown anomalously large offset angles in the nonadiabatic regime with large Keldysh parameters ($\gamma$). We investigate the process theoretically in the complete range of ellipticity ($\epsilon$) and large range of $\gamma$, employing numerical solutions of time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and nonadiabatic classical-trajectory Monte Carlo simulations matched with the under-the-barrier motion via the nonadiabatic strong field approximation. We show the formation of low-energy structures (LES) at any ellipticity value when the Keldysh parameter is sufficiently large. Three regimes of the interaction in the ($\epsilon$-$\gamma$)-space of parameters are identified via the characteristic PMD features. The significant modification of the recollision picture in the nonadiabatic regime, with so-called anomalous and hybrid slow recollisions, is shown to be behind the LES, inducing extreme nonlinear Coulomb bunching in the phase-space in the polarization plane. Our findings elucidate subtle features of the attosecond electron dynamics in strong-field ionization at extreme conditions and indicate limitations on attosecond imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of the eigenfunctions of two-band systems in two dimensions with a circular edge. Our approach is based on an analytic continuation of the wavenumber, which yields a mapping from the bulk modes to the edge modes. Phase relations of the eigenfunctions are described by their mapping onto a three-dimensional field of unit vectors. This mapping is studied in detail for a two-band Laplacian model and a Dirac model. The direction of the unit vector identifies the phase relation of the eigenfunctions and enables us to distinguish between the upper band, the lower band and the edge spectrum. Bulk and edge modes are spectrally separated, which results in two transitions from delocalized bulk modes to localized edge modes. These transitions are accompanied by transitions of the phase relations.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Power-efficiency trade-off for finite-time quantum harmonic Otto heat engine via phase-space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic constraints impose a trade-off between power and efficiency in heat engines, preventing the simultaneous achievement of high power and high efficiency. For classical microscopic engines, explicit inequalities have been discovered, demonstrating the inherent inevitability of this power-efficiency trade-off. However, extensions of these results to quantum engines have so far been limited to cases of slow operation. In this study, we derive a power-efficiency trade-off relation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating within a finite time, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic oscillator. By utilizing a phase-space approach based on quasi-probability representations, we establish a universal trade-off relation applicable to arbitrary time-dependent protocols during the adiabatic processes. Our results reveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as the efficiency approaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which is stricter than the Carnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the upper bound is attained, which indicate maximum power is achieved when the generation of quantum coherence is reduced, and the difference in time durations of the isochoric processes increases. These findings are validated through numerical calculations, which confirm their applicability across various types of protocols for heat engine cycles.</description>

      <title>Superheterodyne Rydberg S-band receiver with a multi-tone local oscillator based on an atomic transition loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-vapor sensors based on Rydberg atoms now face a transition towards practical applications, with several outstanding challenges. To achieve the best sensitivities, a superheterodyne mode of operation is desired, which requires the presence of a local oscillator in the vapor cell. This local oscillator hinders several advantages of the sensor, such as stealthy and all-optical operation. We propose and realize a detection scheme, which avoids some of those problems by using multi-tone mixing, where direct usage of the local oscillator at the same frequency is not required. Our scheme is further elaborated on using efficient theoretical methods to predict the performance of the sensor. Our sensor operates at the S-band frequency, known for its usage in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks, without interfering with the signal itself.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes, Modular Entropy, and Capacity of Entanglement in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Epitaxial Laterally Overgrown Diamond: Towards Up-scaling of Color Center-based Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing high-quality, single-crystal diamond (SCD) with a large area is desirable for up-scaling quantum technology applications that rely on color centers in diamond. Growth methods aiming to increase the area of SCD are an active research area. Native color centers offer a sensitive probe for local crystal quality in such novel materials e.g., via their reaction to stress. In this work, we investigate individual native nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in SCD layers manufactured via laterally overgrowing hole arrays in a heteroepitaxially grown large-scale substrate. Heteroepitaxy has become a common tool for growing large SCDs; however, achieving the high crystal quality needed for quantum applications remains a challenge. In the overgrown layer, we identify NV centers with spin-decoherence times in the order of hundreds of microseconds, comparable to high-purity homoepitaxial SCD. We quantify the effective crystal strain in different regions of the overgrown layer, indicating a low stress overall and a stress reduction in the diamond layer above the holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Density matrices and entropy operator for non-Hermitian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider density matrices operator related to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In particular, we analyse two natural extensions of what is usually called a density matrix operator (DM), of pure states and of the entropy operator: we first consider those {\em operators} which are simply similar to a standard DM, and then we discuss those which are intertwined with a DM by a third, non invertible, operator, giving rise to waht we call Riesz Density Matrix operator (RDM). After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of $PT$-quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.</description>

      <title>Andreev spin relaxation time in a shadow-evaporated InAs weak link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andreev spin qubits are a new qubit platform that merges superconductivity with semiconductor physics. The mechanisms dominating observed energy relaxation remain unidentified. We report here on three steps taken to address these questions in an InAs nanowire weak link. First, we designed a microwave readout circuit tuned to be directly sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance of the weak link so that higher orbital states are not necessary for readout -- this resulted in larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state properties can be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering strategy to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was fabricated by \textit{in situ} shadow evaporation, which has been shown to improve atomic-scale disorder. We show how our design allows characterization of the spin stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and gate voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing rates are comparable with the best devices previously reported, suggestive that surface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not linked to spin relaxation in InAs nanowires. Our design strategies are transferrable to novel materials platforms for Andreev qubits such as germanium and carbon.</description>

      <title>Exact path integrals on half-line in quantum cosmology with a fluid clock and aspects of operator ordering ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D\geq 2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.</description>

      <title>Strain induced topological phase transitions in split and line graphs of bipartite lattices featuring flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. This includes phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, Wigner crystallization, and Mott-insulating behavior. Among these systems, two-dimensional (2D) materials are particularly compelling as they can host electronic states with unique band structures, such as dispersionless states alongside linearly dispersive Dirac cones. In this work, we use tight-binding models to comprehensively investigate a class of 2D lattices that generically support flat bands, and focus on the effects of strain on their electronic and topological properties. The studied lattices are constructed within a unifying graph-theoretic framework, whereupon split-graph and line-graph operations on bipartite square and hexagonal lattices are employed to generate new structures. In the absence of strain, the introduction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a bulk excitation gap, which transforms flat bands into quasi-flat bands with topologically nontrivial characteristics. By tuning system parameters and external strain, we observe the emergence of directional flat bands, and tilted and semi-Dirac cones. Remarkably, all lattices studied show phase transitions among trivial insulating, semimetallic, and topological phases. Our results highlight the potential of strain engineering as a versatile tool for manipulating electronic and topological phases in a wide variety of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature quantum emission from $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS:Cu colloidal nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report room-temperature observations of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ quantum emitters in individual ZnS:Cu nanocrystals (NCs). Using time-gated imaging, we isolate the distinct, $\sim$3-$\mu$s-long, red photoluminescence (PL) emission of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects, enabling their precise identification and statistical characterization. The emitters exhibit distinct blinking and photon antibunching, consistent with individual NCs containing two to four $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects. The quantum emitters' PL spectra show a pronounced blue shift compared to NC dispersions, likely due to photochemical and charging effects. Emission polarization measurements of quantum emitters are consistent with a $\sigma$-character optical dipole transition and the symmetry of the $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defect. These observations motivate further investigation of $\mathrm{Cu_{Zn}}$-$\mathrm{V_{S}}$ defects in ZnS NCs for use in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of Subnatural-Linewidth Biphotons In a Two-Level Atomic Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biphotons and single photons with narrow bandwidths and long coherence times are essential to the realization of long-distance quantum communication (LDQC) and linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). In this Letter, we manipulate the biphoton wave functions of the spontaneous four-wave mixing in a two-level atomic ensemble with a single-laser pump scheme. Our innovative experimental approach enables the generation of biphotons with a sub-MHz bandwidth of 0.36 MHz, a record spectral brightness of $2.28\times10^7$${\rm s}^{-1}{\rm mW}^{-1}{\rm MHz}^{-1}$, and a temporally symmetric wave packet at moderate optical depth. The strong non-classical cross-correlation of the biphotons also enables the observation of heralded sub-MHz-linewidth single photons with a pronounced single-photon nature. The generation of sub-MHz-linewidth biphotons and single photons with a two-level atomic ensembles not only finds applications in quantum repeaters and large cluster states for LDQC and LOQC but also opens up the opportunity to miniaturize the biphoton or single-photon sources for chip-scale quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the presence of chiral spin states in molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a three-spin-center system, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions give rise to two ground-state doublets, each state within the doublet exhibiting distinct spin-spectrum chirality. This chirality becomes significant when external perturbations are introduced. We explored, from a theoretical perspective, the presence of spin-chirality in Lanthanide complexes that feature two magnetic centers. The applied electric-potential, couples to the system electric dipole moment ($\mu$), modifying the spin-orbit interaction ($\hat{L}.\hat{S}$). This modification is formally expressed through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), whose role is to selectively activate one spin state in the doublet pair, as confirmed by computing the scalar spin-chirality ($\chi$). To validate the presence of chiral spin states, we performed spin-dynamics simulations using the Liouville-von Neumann equation within the density matrix formalism. The initial state was prepared as a superposition $1/\sqrt{2}(\rho_{01}+\rho_{10})$, and its time evolution revealed that each state in the doublet acquires a distinct phase, indicating their residence in separate phase spaces. This also demonstrated that the fidelity of the initial prepared state remains stable over an extended period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit two distinct topological classifications based on their gap structure: line-gap and point-gap topologies. Although point-gap topology is intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, its systematic construction remains a challenge. Here, we present the Floquet engineering approach for realizing point-gapped topological superconductors. By combining Floquet theory with particle-hole symmetry (PHS), we show that a point gap hosting robust Majorana edge modes emerges at the overlap of Floquet bands with opposite winding numbers. In the thermodynamic limit, even weak non-Hermiticity opens a point gap from a gapless spectrum, driving a topological phase transition and breaking non-Bloch parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. This transition is accompanied by the appearance of the Floquet $Z_2$ skin effect. Furthermore, the point-gapped topological phase and the non-Bloch $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry exhibit size-dependent phenomena driven by the critical skin effect. Our work offers a new pathway for exploring the point-gapped topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian wave-packet dynamics and its realization within a non-Hermitian chiral cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological wave-packet dynamics provide a powerful framework for studying quantum transport in topological materials. However, extending this approach to non-Hermitian quantum systems presents several important challenges, primarily due to ambiguities in defining the Berry phase and the non-unitary evolution of the wave-packets when $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry is broken. In this work, we adopt the complex Berry phase definition using the bi-orthogonal formalism and derive the semiclassical equations of motion (EOM) for a wave-packet in a non-Hermitian topological system. Interestingly, we find that the complex Berry curvature introduces both an anomalous velocity and an anomalous force into the semiclassical EOM. To validate the derived EOM, we design a non-Hermitian Haldane model featuring non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, where the imbalance in the NNN hopping amplitudes gives rise to an emergent `complex chirality'. We reveal that the real and imaginary components of the complex chirality dictate the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the complex Berry curvature, as well as the direction and dissipation rate of the edge states. Our analytical findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the wave-packet dynamics. Finally, we suggest a potential experimental realization of this complex Haldane model using a non-Hermitian optical chiral cavity, providing a promising platform for testing our theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Methods from Quantum Information Theory are used to scrutinize quantum correlations encoded in the two-quark density matrix over light-cone momentum fractions $x_1$ and $x_2$. A non-perturbative three quark model light-cone wavefunction predicts significant non-classical correlations associated with the "entanglement negativity" measure for asymmetric and small quark momentum fractions. We perform one step of QCD scale evolution of the entire density matrix, not just its diagonal (dPDF), by computing collinearly divergent corrections due to the emission of a gluon. Finally, we present first qualitative numerical results for single-step scale evolution of quantum entanglement correlations in double quark PDFs. At a higher $Q^2$ scale, the non-classical correlations manifest in the dPDF for nearly symmetric momentum fractions.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Khovanov homology is a topological knot invariant that categorifies the Jones polynomial, recognizes the unknot, and is conjectured to appear as an observable in $4D$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. Despite its rich mathematical and physical significance, the computational complexity of Khovanov homology remains largely unknown. To address this challenge, this work initiates the study of efficient quantum algorithms for Khovanov homology.
  We provide simple proofs that increasingly accurate additive approximations to the ranks of Khovanov homology are DQC1-hard, BQP-hard, and #P-hard, respectively. For the first two approximation regimes, we propose a novel quantum algorithm. Our algorithm is efficient provided the corresponding Hodge Laplacian thermalizes in polynomial time and has a sufficiently large spectral gap, for which we give numerical and analytical evidence.
  Our approach introduces a pre-thermalization procedure that allows our quantum algorithm to succeed even if the Betti numbers of Khovanov homology are much smaller than the dimensions of the corresponding chain spaces, overcoming a limitation of prior quantum homology algorithms. We introduce novel connections between Khovanov homology and graph theory to derive analytic lower bounds on the spectral gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.03126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The no-masking theorem says that masking quantum information is impossible in a bipartite scenario. However, there exist schemes to mask quantum states in multipartite systems. In this work, we show that, the joint measurement in the teleportation is really a masking process, when the apparatus is regarded as a quantum participant in the whole system. Based on the view, we present two four-partite maskers and a tripartite masker. One of the former provides a generalization in arbitrary dimension of the four-qubit scheme given by Li and Wang [Phys. Rev. A 98, 062306 (2018)], and the latter is precisely their tripartite scheme. The occupation probabilities and coherence of quantum states are masked in two steps of our schemes. And the information can be extracted naturally in their reverse processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For single-photon generation based on cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate a practical model assuming a Gaussian wavepacket. This model makes it possible to comprehensively analyze the temporal dynamics of an atom-cavity system with both adiabatic and nonadiabatic conditions using analytical expressions. These results enable us to clarify the relationship between pulse width and maximum success probability, over the full range of coupling regimes. We demonstrate how to achieve a high success probability while keeping a short pulse width by optimizing the cavity transmittance parameter and the time-controlled exexternal field. Our formulations provide a practical tool for efficient single-photon generation in a wide variety of experimental platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define rewinding operators that invert quantum measurements. Then, we define complexity classes ${\sf RwBQP}$, ${\sf CBQP}$, and ${\sf AdPostBQP}$ as sets of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size quantum circuits with a polynomial number of rewinding operators, cloning operators, and adaptive postselections, respectively. Our main result is that ${\sf BPP}^{\sf PP}\subseteq{\sf RwBQP}={\sf CBQP}={\sf AdPostBQP}\subseteq{\sf PSPACE}$. As a byproduct of this result, we show that any problem in ${\sf PostBQP}$ can be solved with only postselections of events that occur with probabilities polynomially close to one. Under the strongly believed assumption that ${\sf BQP}\nsupseteq{\sf SZK}$, or the shortest independent vectors problem cannot be efficiently solved with quantum computers, we also show that a single rewinding operator is sufficient to achieve tasks that are intractable for quantum computation. Finally, we show that rewindable Clifford circuits remain classically simulatable, but rewindable instantaneous quantum polynomial time circuits can solve any problem in ${\sf PP}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past century, a large community within theoretical physics has been seeking a unified framework for quantum gravity. Yet, to date, there is still no experimental evidence of any non-classical features of gravity. While traditional experimental proposals would usually require immensely challenging Planck scale experiments, recent table-top protocols based on low-energy quantum control have opened a new avenue into the investigation of non-classical gravity. An approach that has sparked high interest, both in terms of experimental feasibility and of theoretical implications, is the indirect witnessing of non-classical gravity through the detection of its capacity to act as an entangling channel. Most discussions have been centred on the entanglement generation between two gravitationally coupled massive systems. In this work, we instead examine the entangling capacity of the gravitational interaction between two light pulses. We explain the main experimental and theoretical advantages of having a photonic protocol, and lay out the steps leading to the determination of the entangling phase, using the path integral formalism and linearised gravity. We establish a closed form formula for the entangling phase and provide an estimated order of magnitude of the average photon number required for the generation of appreciable phase. Using statistical analysis, we show how entanglement may be certified with lower phase signal.</description>

      <title>Optimal cavity design for minimizing errors in cavity-QED-based atom-photon entangling gates with finite temporal duration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate atom-photon entangling gates based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) for a finite photon-pulse duration, where not only the photon loss but also the temporal mode-mismatch of the photon pulse becomes a severe source of error. We analytically derive relations between cavity parameters, including transmittance, length, and effective cross-sectional area of the cavity, that minimize both the photon loss probability and the error rate due to temporal mode-mismatch by taking it into account as state-dependent pulse delay. We also investigate the effects of pulse distortion using numerical simulations for the case of short pulse duration. We believe that these analyses are the first to suggest that a cavity has an optimal length for the atom-photon gate, providing a fundamental guideline for implementing quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Efficient and fail-safe quantum algorithm for the transport equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scalable algorithm for solving the transport equation in two and three spatial dimensions for variable grid sizes and discrete velocities on a fault-tolerant universal quantum computer. As a proof of concept of our quantum transport method (QTM), we describe a full-circuit start-to-end implementation in Qiskit and present numerical results for 2D flows. Our QTM is based on a novel streaming approach which leads to a reduction in the amount of CNOT gates required in comparison to state-of-the-art quantum streaming methods. As a second highlight we present a novel object encoding method, that reduces the complexity of the amount of CNOT gates required to encode walls, which now becomes independent of the size of the wall. Finally we present a novel quantum encoding of the particles' discrete velocities that enables a linear speed-up in the costs of reflecting the velocity of a particle, which now becomes independent of the amount of velocities encoded. Our main contribution is a detailed description of a fail-safe implementation of a quantum algorithm for the reflection step of the transport equation that can be readily implemented on a physical quantum computer. This fail-safe implementation allows for a variety of initial conditions and particle velocities and leads to physically correct behavior around the walls, edges and corners of obstacles. Combining these results we present a novel and fail-safe start-to-end quantum algorithm for the transport equation that can be used for a multitude of flow configurations. We finally show that our approach is quadratic in the amount of qubits necessary to encode the grid and the amount of qubits necessary to encode the discrete velocities in a single spatial dimension, which makes our approach superior to state-of-the-art approaches known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Security of differential phase shift QKD from relativistic principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of quantum protocols for secure key generation poses many challenges: On the one hand, they need to be practical concerning experimental realisations. On the other hand, their theoretical description must be simple enough to allow for a security proof against all possible attacks. Often, these two requirements are in conflict with each other, and the differential phase shift (DPS) QKD protocol exemplifies these difficulties: It is designed to be implementable with current optical telecommunication technology, which, for this protocol, comes at the cost that many standard security proof techniques do not apply to it. After about 20 years since its invention, this work presents the first full security proof of DPS QKD against general attacks, including finite-size effects. The proof combines techniques from quantum information theory, quantum optics, and relativity. We first give a security proof of a QKD protocol whose security stems from relativistic constraints. We then show that security of DPS QKD can be reduced to security of the relativistic protocol. In addition, we show that coherent attacks on the DPS protocol are, in fact, stronger than collective attacks. Our results have broad implications for the development of secure and reliable quantum communication technologies, as they shed light on the range of applicability of state-of-the-art security proof techniques.</description>

      <title>On the importance of data encoding in quantum Boltzmann methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum Boltzmann methods have gained more and more interest as they might provide a viable path towards solving fluid dynamics problems on quantum computers once this emerging compute technology has matured and fault-tolerant many-qubit systems become available. The major challenge in developing a start-to-end quantum algorithm for the Boltzmann equation consists in encoding relevant data efficiently in quantum bits (qubits) and formulating the streaming, collision and reflection steps as one comprehensive unitary operation. The current literature on quantum Boltzmann methods mostly proposes data encodings and quantum primitives for individual phases of the pipeline assuming that they can be combined to a full algorithm.
  In this paper we disprove this assumption by showing that for encodings commonly discussed in literature either the collision or the streaming step cannot be unitary. Building on this landmark result we propose a novel encoding in which the number of qubits used to encode the velocity depends on the number of time steps one wishes to simulate, with the upper bound depending on the total number of grid points.
  In light of the non-unitarity result established for existing encodings, our encoding method is to the best of our knowledge the only one currently known that can be used for a start-to-end quantum Boltzmann solver where both the collision and the streaming step are implemented as a unitary operation. Furthermore our theoretical unitarity result can serve as a guideline on which types of encodings to consider or whether a `stop-and-go' method with repeated measurements and re-initializations is the method of choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an innovative, platform-independent concept for multiparameter sensing where the measurable parameters are in series, or cascaded, enabling measurements as a function of position. With temporally resolved detection, we show that squeezing can give a quantum enhancement in sensitivity over that of classical states by a factor of $e^{2r}$, where $r \approx 1$ is the squeezing parameter. As an example, we have modeled an interferometer that senses multiple phase shifts along the same path, demonstrating a maximal quantum advantage by combining a coherent state with squeezed vacuum. Further classical modeling with up to 100 phases shows linear scaling potential for adding nodes to the sensor. The approach represents a new paradigm in multiparameter quantum metrology, and can be applied to remote sensing, geophysical surveying, and infrastructure monitoring.</description>

      <title>Efficient ground-state energy estimation and certification on early fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major thrust in quantum algorithm development over the past decade has been the search for the quantum algorithms that will deliver practical quantum advantage first. Today's quantum computers - and even early fault-tolerant quantum computers - are limited in the number of operations they can implement per circuit. We introduce quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation (GSEE) that accommodate this design constraint. The first algorithm estimates ground-state energies, offering a quadratic improvement on the ground state overlap parameter compared to other methods in this regime. The second algorithm certifies that the estimated ground-state energy is within a specified error tolerance of the true ground-state energy, addressing the issue of gap estimation that beleaguers several ground state preparation and energy estimation algorithms. We note, however, that the scaling of this certification technique is currently less favorable than that of the GSEE algorithm. To develop the certification algorithm, we propose a novel use of quantum computers to facilitate rejection sampling. After a classical computer generates initial samples, the quantum computer is used to accept or reject these samples, resulting in a set of accepted samples that approximate draws from a target distribution. Although we apply this technique specifically for ground-state energy certification, it may find broader applications. Our work pushes the boundaries of what operation-limited quantum computers can achieve, bringing the prospect of quantum advantage closer to realization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Leakage Errors in Quantum Error Correcting Codes Using Tensor Network Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leakage errors, in which a qubit is excited to a level outside the qubit subspace, represent a significant obstacle in the development of robust quantum computers. We present a computationally efficient simulation methodology for studying leakage errors in quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) using tensor network methods, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). Our approach enables the simulation of various leakage processes, including thermal noise and coherent errors, without approximations (such as the Pauli twirling approximation) that can lead to errors in the estimation of the logical error rate. We apply our method to two QECCs: the one-dimensional (1D) repetition code and a thin $3\times d$ surface code. By leveraging the small amount of entanglement generated during the error correction process, we are able to study large systems, up to a few hundred qudits, over many code cycles. We consider a realistic noise model of leakage relevant to superconducting qubits to evaluate code performance and a variety of leakage removal strategies. Our numerical results suggest that appropriate leakage removal is crucial, especially when the code distance is large.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate the effects that multi-mode photonic environments, e.g., optical cavities, have on the properties of quantum matter. We highlight the importance of the non-perturbative mass renormalization procedure for ab initio quantum electrodynamics simulations and how it connects to common approximations used in polaritonic chemistry and cavity materials engineering. We focus on one-dimensional systems which can be solved exactly for large number of photon modes. First, we apply mass renormalization to free particles. The value of the renormalized mass depends on the details of the photonic environment and on the number of particles. We then show how the multi-mode photon field influences various ground- and excited-state properties of atomic and molecular systems. For instance, we observe the enhancement of particle confinement in the binding potential for the atomic system, and the modification of the potential energy surfaces of the molecular dimer due to photon-mediated long-range interactions. We also highlight how these changes compare to the common free-space mass-renormalization approximation employed in electronic structure theory and quantum chemistry. Since such phenomena are enhanced under strong light-matter coupling in a cavity environment they will become relevant for the emerging fields of polaritonic chemistry and cavity materials engineering.</description>

      <title>On the Emergent "Quantum" Theory in Complex Adaptive Systems</title>

Abstract: We explore the concept of emergent quantum-like theory in complex adaptive systems, and examine in particular the concrete example of such an emergent (or "mock") quantum theory in the Lotka-Volterra system. In general, we investigate the possibility of implementing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics on classical systems, and what would be the conditions for using such an approach. We start from a standard description of a classical system via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation and reduce it to an effective Schr\"odinger-type equation, with a (mock) Planck constant $\mockbar$, which is system-dependent. The condition for this is that the so-called quantum potential VQ, which is state-dependent, is cancelled out by some additional term in the HJ equation. We consider this additional term to provide for the coupling of the classical system under consideration to the "environment." We assume that a classical system could cancel out the VQ term (at least approximately) by fine tuning to the environment. This might provide a mechanism for establishing a stable, stationary states in (complex) adaptive systems, such as biological systems. In this context we emphasize the state dependent nature of the mock quantum dynamics and we also introduce the new concept of the mock quantum, state dependent, statistical field theory. We also discuss some universal features of the quantum-to-classical as well as the mock-quantum-to-classical transition found in the turbulent phase of the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposal. In this way we reframe the concept of decoherence into the concept of "quantum turbulence," i.e. that the transition between quantum and classical could be defined in analogy to the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks provide a prospective tool for error mitigation in quantum simulation of physical systems. However, we need both noisy and noise-free data to train neural networks to mitigate errors in quantum computing results. Here, we propose a physics-motivated method to generate training data for quantum error mitigation via neural networks, which does not require classical simulation and target circuit simplification. In particular, we propose to use the echo evolution of a quantum system to collect noisy and noise-free data for training a neural network. Under this method, the initial state evolves forward and backward in time, returning to the initial state at the end of evolution. When run on a noisy quantum processor, the resulting state will be affected by the quantum noise accumulated during evolution. Having a vector of observable values of the initial (noise-free) state and the resulting (noisy) state allows us to compose training data for a neural network. We demonstrate that a feed-forward fully connected neural network trained on echo-evolution-generated data can correct results of forward-in-time evolution. Our findings can enhance the application of neural networks to error mitigation in quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic codes allow the encoding of a logical qubit in a single component device, utilizing the infinitely large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator. In particular, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code has recently been demonstrated to be correctable well beyond the break-even point of the best passive encoding in the same system. Current approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) for this system are based on protocols that use feedback, but the response is based only on the latest measurement outcome. In our work, we use the recently proposed Feedback-GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering with Feedback) method to train a recurrent neural network that provides a QEC scheme based on memory, responding in a non-Markovian way to the full history of previous measurement outcomes, optimizing all subsequent unitary operations. This approach significantly outperforms current strategies and paves the way for more powerful measurement-based QEC protocols.</description>

Abstract: Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order linear differential equation, system of differential equations, nonlinear Duffing and Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (SAPINN) approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order differential equations. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of differential equations on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Designing fast quantum gates using optimal control with a reinforcement-learning ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast quantum gates are crucial not only for the contemporary era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices but also for the prospective development of practical fault-tolerant quantum computing. Leakage errors, which arise from data qubits jumping beyond the confines of the computational subspace, are the main challenges in realizing non-adiabatically driven, fast gates. In this work, we propose and illustrate the usefulness of reinforcement learning (RL) to generate fast two-qubit gates in practical multilevel superconducting qubits. In particular, we show that the RL controller offers great effectiveness in finding piecewise constant gate pulse sequences that act on two transmon data qubits coupled by a tunable coupler to generate a controlled-Z (CZ) gate with a gate time of 10 ns and an error rate of $\sim 4\times 10^{-3}$. Using a gradient-based method to solve the same optimization problem often does not achieve high fidelity for such fast gates. However, we show that using the gate pulses discovered by RL as an ansatz for the gradient-based controller can substantially enhance fidelity compared to using RL alone. While for a 10 ns pulse, this improvement is marginal, the combined RL + gradient approach decreases the gate errors below $10^{-4}$ for a gate of length 20 ns.</description>

      <title>Microwave single-photon detection using a hybrid spin-optomechanical quantum interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor single-photon detectors cannot be straightforwardly adapted for the microwave regime, primarily because microwave photons carry far less energy and thus require cryogenic temperatures and specialized architectures. Here, we propose a hybrid spin-optomechanical interface to detect single microwave photons where the microwave photons are coupled to a phononic resonator via piezoelectric actuation. This phononic cavity also acts as a photonic cavity with either a single embedded Silicon-Vacancy (SiV) center in diamond or an ensemble of these centers, bridging optical single-photon detection protocols into the microwave domain. We model the detection process as a communication channel whose capacity is quantified by the mutual information \(I(A;B)\) between the true photon occupancy (A) and the detector outcome (B). Depending on experimentally achievable parameters, simulations predict \(I(A;B)\) in the range \(0.57\,\ln(2)\) to \(0.67\,\ln(2)\), corresponding to true-positive (detection) probabilities above 90\% and false-positive (dark count) probabilities below 10\% per detection interval. These results suggest a viable path to low-noise, high-efficiency single-photon detection at microwave frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a crucial role in the development of quantum-enabled devices. One significant objective is the deterministic creation and distribution of entangled states, achieved, for example, through a mechanical oscillator interacting with confined electromagnetic fields. In this study, we explore a cavity resonator containing a two-sided perfect mirror. Although the mirror separates the cavity modes into two independent confined electromagnetic fields, the radiation pressure interaction gives rise to high-order effective interactions across all subsystems. Depending on the chosen resonant conditions, which are also related to the position of the mirror, we study $2n$-photon entanglement generation and bilateral photon pair emission. Demonstrating the non-classical nature of the mechanical oscillator, we provide a pathway to control these phenomena, opening potential applications in quantum technologies. Looking ahead, similar integrated devices could be used to entangle subsystems across vastly different energy scales, such as microwave and optical photons.</description>

      <title>On the significance of Wigner's Friend in contexts beyond quantum foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a surge of recent interest in the Wigner's Friend paradox, sparking several novel thought experiments and no-go theorems. The main narrative has been that Wigner's Friend highlights a counterintuitive feature that is unique to quantum theory, and which is closely related to the quantum measurement problem. Here, we challenge this view. We argue that the gist of the Wigner's Friend paradox can be reproduced without assuming quantum physics, and that it underlies a much broader class of enigmas in the foundations of physics and philosophy. To show this, we first consider several recently proposed Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios, and demonstrate that some of their implications for the absoluteness of observations can be reproduced by classical thought experiments that involve the duplication of agents. Crucially, some of these classical scenarios are technologically much easier to implement than their quantum counterparts. Then, we argue that the essential structural ingredient of all these scenarios is a feature that we call "Restriction A": essentially, that a physical theory cannot give us a probabilistic description of the observations of all agents. Finally, we argue that this difficulty is at the core of other puzzles in the foundations of physics and philosophy, and demonstrate this explicitly for cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem. Our analysis suggests that Wigner's Friend should be studied in a larger context, addressing a frontier of human knowledge beyond quantum foundations: to obtain reliable predictions for experiments in which these predictions can be privately but not intersubjectively verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cram\'er-Rao bound serves as a crucial lower limit for the mean squared error of an estimator in frequentist parameter estimation. Paradoxically, it requires highly accurate prior knowledge of the estimated parameter for constructing the optimal unbiased estimator. In contrast, Bhattacharyya bounds offer a more robust estimation framework with respect to prior accuracy by introducing additional constraints on the estimator. In this work, we examine divergences that arise in the computation of these bounds and establish the conditions under which they remain valid. Notably, we show that when the number of constraints exceeds the number of measurement outcomes, an estimator with finite variance typically does not exist. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the properties of these bounds using paradigmatic examples, comparing them to the Cram\'er-Rao and Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamically consistent approach to the energy costs of quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16037v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a general microscopic model for a quantum measuring apparatus comprising a quantum probe coupled to a thermal bath, we analyze the energetic resources necessary for the realization of a quantum measurement, which includes the creation of system-apparatus correlations, the irreversible transition to a statistical mixture of definite outcomes, and the apparatus resetting. Crucially, we do not resort to another quantum measurement to capture the emergence of objective measurement results, but rather exploit the properties of the thermal bath which redundantly records the measurement result in its degrees of freedom, naturally implementing the paradigm of quantum Darwinism. In practice, this model allows us to perform a quantitative thermodynamic analysis of the measurement process. From the expression of the second law, we show how the minimal required work depends on the energy variation of the system being measured plus information-theoretic quantities characterizing the performance of the measurement -- efficiency and completeness. Additionally, we show that it is possible to perform a thermodynamically reversible measurement, thus reaching the minimal work expenditure, and provide the corresponding protocol. Finally, for finite-time measurement protocols, we illustrate the increasing work cost induced by rising entropy production inherent in finite-time thermodynamic processes. This highlights an emerging trade-off between velocity of the measurement and work cost, on top of a trade-off between efficiency of the measurement and work cost. We apply those findings to bring new insights in the thermodynamic balance of the measurement-powered quantum engines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a universal method to obtain fast charging of a quantum battery by a driven charger system using controlled, pure dephasing of the charger. While the battery displays coherent underdamped oscillations of energy for weak charger dephasing, the quantum Zeno freezing of the charger energy at high dephasing suppresses the rate of transfer of energy to the battery. Choosing an optimum dephasing rate between the regimes leads to a fast charging of the battery. We illustrate our results with the charger and battery modeled by either two-level systems or harmonic oscillators. Apart from the fast charging, the dephasing also renders the charging performance more robust to detuning between the charger, drive, and battery frequencies for the two-level systems case.</description>

      <title>On the simulation of quantum multimeters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest for robust and universal quantum devices, the notion of simulation plays a crucial role, both from a theoretical and from an applied perspective. In this work, we go beyond the simulation of quantum channels and quantum measurements, studying what it means to simulate a collection of measurements, which we call a multimeter. To this end, we first explicitly characterize the completely positive transformations between multimeters. However, not all of these transformations correspond to valid simulations, as otherwise we could create any resource from nothing. For example, the set of transformations includes maps that always prepare the same multimeter regardless of the input, which we call trash-and-prepare. From the perspective of an experimenter with a given multimeter as part of a complicated setup, having to discard the multimeter and using a different one instead is undesirable. We give a new definition of multimeter simulations as transformations that are triviality-preserving, i.e., when given a multimeter consisting of trivial measurements they can only produce another trivial multimeter. In the absence of a quantum ancilla, we then characterize the transformations that are triviality-preserving and the transformations that are trash-and-prepare. Finally, we use these characterizations to compare our new definition of multimeter simulation to three existing ones: classical simulations, compression of multimeters, and compatibility-preserving simulations.</description>

With the help of Cannon's algorithm, the distributed computing transformation of numerical method for simulating quantum unitary evolution is achieved. Based on the Tavis-Cummings model, a large number of atoms are added into the optical cavity to obtain a high-dimensional quantum closed system, implemented on the supercomputer platform.

Abstract: We investigate the microscopic origin of the negative pressure produced by the constant energy density of the vacuum. It is shown that the zero-point photons in the quantum vacuum could generate the pressures of this type in confined spaces for the photon field. We find in particular that an anomalous radiation plays a role in the occurrence of a negative pressure from the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Sequential and Programmable Squeezing Gates for Optical Non-Gaussian Input States</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing has been pursued with various hardware platforms, and an optical system is one of the most reasonable choices for large-scale computation. In the optical continuous-variable computation scheme, the incorporation of Gaussian gates and a highly non-classical non-Gaussian state enables universal quantum computation. Although basic technologies for Gaussian gates and non-Gaussian state generations have long been developed, these building blocks have not yet been integrated in a scalable fashion. Here, we integrate them to develop a scalable and programmable optical quantum computing platform that can sequentially perform an essential Gaussian gate, the squeezing gate, on a non-Gaussian input state. The key enablers are a loop-based optical circuit with dynamical and programmable controllability and its time-synchronization with the probabilistic non-Gaussian state generation. We verify the deterministic, programmable, and repeatable quantum gates on a typical non-Gaussian state by implementing up to three-step gates. The gates implemented are so high-quality that strong evidence of the states' non-classicalities, negativities of the Wigner functions, are preserved even after multistep gates. This platform is compatible with other non-Gaussian states and can in principle realize large-scale universal quantum computing by incorporating other existing processing technologies.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we explore the inconsistencies in the physics of fermionic oscillators and propose potential solutions to address them. By rigorously deriving the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian from first principles, we aim to provide a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the system. Furthermore, we calculate the partition function for a system of fermionic oscillators by drawing a direct analogy to Planck's treatment of energy distribution in bosonic oscillators, offering a parallel approach to this well-established method. Our study extends beyond the conventional framework by investigating the generalized angular momentum algebra within the context of Schwinger's oscillator model. This includes a detailed examination of the algebraic structures for combinations of bosonic-bosonic, bosonic-fermionic, and fermionic-fermionic oscillators. Through this, we delve into these systems' underlying symmetries and algebraic richness, shedding light on the intricate relationships between these different types of oscillators. In addition to these foundational aspects, we explore the broader implications of this generalized Schwinger approach. Our analysis touches upon potential applications and consequences of this formalism, offering insights that could be relevant to various areas of theoretical physics. This work paves the way for a deeper understanding of quantum oscillators and their role in modern physics by bridging the gap between bosonic and fermionic oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an epileptic-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using the Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuits for Non-Unitary and Unitary Diagonal Operators with Space-Time-Accuracy trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e., the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, i.e, the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e., the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation. This simulation paves the way to efficient implementations of stochastic models useful in physics, chemistry, biology, image processing and finance.</description>

      <title>Density Classification with Non-Unitary Quantum Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density classification (DC) task, a computation which maps global density information to local density, is studied using one-dimensional non-unitary quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Two approaches are considered: one that preserves the number density and one that performs majority voting. For number preserving DC, two QCAs are introduced that reach the fixed point solution in a time scaling quadratically with the system size. One of the QCAs is based on a known classical probabilistic cellular automaton which has been studied in the context of DC. The second is a new quantum model that is designed to demonstrate additional quantum features and is restricted to only two-body interactions. Both can be generated by continuous-time Lindblad dynamics. A third QCA is a hybrid rule defined by both discrete-time and continuous-time three-body interactions that is shown to solve the majority voting problem within a time that scales linearly with the system size.</description>

      <title>Robust photonic quantum gates with large number of waveguide segments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing quantum information processors is challenged by errors and noise across all platforms. While composite segmentation schemes have been proposed in many systems, their application to photonic quantum gates in dual-rail configurations has only recently been demonstrated. However, prior research has been limited to a small number of segments, full noise correlation, and has overlooked the inherent power loss in such designs. Here, we study the fidelity and power loss of composite designs for photonic quantum gates with a high number of segments of varying geometrical widths. Using numerical simulations, we analyze the relationship between gate performance and the number of waveguide segments, accounting for statistical error correlations and variances. Beyond effectively reducing the errors, an asymptotic scaling pattern of quantum gate fidelity and power loss is observed as the number of segments increases. This analysis is examined in Silicon and Lithium Niobate platforms, addressing practical implementation challenges. Our findings demonstrate that optimized multi-segment waveguide geometrical designs significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of photonic quantum gates, paving the way for more reliable quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Momentum exchange method for quantum Boltzmann methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past years have seen a surge in quantum algorithms for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These algorithms have in common that whilst promising a speed-up in the performance of the algorithm, no specific method of measurement has been suggested. This means that while the algorithms presented in the literature may be promising methods for creating the quantum state that represents the final flow field, an efficient measurement strategy is not available. This paper marks the first quantum method proposed to efficiently calculate quantities of interest (QoIs) from a state vector representing the flow field. In particular, we propose a method to calculate the force acting on an object immersed in the fluid using a quantum version of the momentum exchange method (MEM) that is commonly used in lattice Boltzmann methods to determine the drag and lift coefficients. In order to achieve this we furthermore give a scheme that implements bounce back boundary conditions on a quantum computer, as those are the boundary conditions the momentum exchange method is designed for.</description>

      <title>Sign problem in tensor network contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate an atom interferometer measurement protocol compatible with operation on a dynamic platform. Our method employs two open interferometers, derived from the same atomic source, with different interrogation times to eliminate initial velocity dependence while retaining precision, accuracy, and long term stability. We validate the protocol by measuring gravitational tides, achieving a precision of 4.5 {\mu}Gal in 2000 runs (6.7 h), marking the first demonstration of inertial quantity measurement with open atom interferometry that achieves long-term phase stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suspending devices on thin SiN membranes can limit their interaction with the bulk substrate and reduce parasitic capacitance to ground. While suspending devices on membranes is used in many fields including radiation detection using superconducting circuits, there has been less investigation into maximum membrane aspect ratios and achievable suspended device quality, metrics important to establish the applicable scope of the technique. Here, we investigate these metrics by fabricating superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators entirely atop thin ($\sim$110 nm) SiN membranes, where the membrane's shortest length to thickness yields an aspect ratio of approximately $7.4 \times 10^3$. We compare these membrane resonators to on-substrate resonators on the same chip, finding similar internal quality factors $\sim$$10^5$ at single photon levels. Furthermore, we confirm that these membranes do not adversely affect resonator thermalization and conduct further materials characterization. By achieving high quality superconducting circuit devices fully suspended on thin SiN membranes, our results help expand the technique's scope to potential uses including incorporating higher aspect ratio membranes for device suspension and creating larger footprint, high impedance, and high quality devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum systems with energy constraints relative to a reference Hamiltonian. In general, quantum channels and continuous-time dynamics need not satisfy energy conservation. Physically meaningful channels, however, only introduce a finite amount of energy to the system, and continuous-time dynamics only increase the energy gradually over time. We systematically study such "energy-limited" channels and dynamics. For Markovian dynamics, energy-limitedness is equivalent to a single operator inequality in the Heisenberg picture. We observe new submultiplicativity inequalities for the energy-constrained diamond and operator norms and use them to derive new state-dependent continuity bounds for quantum speed limits.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the entanglement dynamics of different subsystems such as atom-atom, atom-field and field-field with radiation field in squeezed coherent thermal states for the intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model (IDDJCM) and double Jaynes-Cummings model (DJCM) are investigated. The effects of both squeezed photons and thermal photons on entanglement dynamics is observed. The main feature of the double Jaynes-Cummings model - entanglement sudden death is observed for every subsystem. The effects of various interactions such as Ising interaction, single photon exchange interaction and dipole-dipole interaction on entanglement dynamics are studied. The effects of detuning, Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are investigated for every subsystem. It is noticed that proper choice of the interactions parameters, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity effectively removes entanglement deaths from the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of External and Internal Dynamics in Driven Two-level Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a laser driven two-level system including quantized external degrees of freedom for each state can be decoupled into a set of oscillator equations acting only on the external degrees of freedom with operator valued damping representing the detuning. We give a way of characterizing the solvability of this family of problems by appealing to a classical oscillator with time-dependent damping. As a consequence of this classification we (a) obtain analytic and representation-free expressions for Rabi oscillations including external degrees of freedom with and without an external linear potential, (b) show that whenever the detuning operator can be diagonalized (analytically or numerically) the problem decomposes into a set of classical equations and (c) we can use the oscillator equations as a perturbative basis to describe Rabi oscillations in weak but otherwise arbitrary external potentials. Moreover, chirping of the driving fields phase emerges naturally as a means of compensating the Ehrenfest/mean-value part of the detuning operator's dynamics while the presence of driving phase noise leads to a stochastic evolution equation of Langevin type. Lastly, our approach is representation free with respect to the external degrees of freedom and as consequence a suitable representation or basis expansion can be chosen a posteriori depending on the desired application at hand.</description>

      <title>Entangling Schr\"odinger's cat states by bridging discrete- and continuous-variable encoding</title>

Abstract: In quantum information processing, two primary research directions have emerged: one based on discrete variables (DV) and the other on the structure of quantum states in a continuous-variable (CV) space. Integrating these two approaches could unlock new potentials, overcoming their respective limitations. Here, we show that such a DV-CV hybrid approach, applied to superconducting Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), enables us to entangle a pair of Schr\"odinger's cat states by two methods. The first involves the entanglement-preserving conversion between Bell states in the Fock-state basis (DV encoding) and those in the cat-state basis (CV encoding). The second method implements a $\sqrt{\textrm{iSWAP}}$ gate between two cat states following the procedure for Fock-state encoding. This simple and fast gate operation completes a universal quantum gate set in a KPO system. Our work offers powerful applications of DV-CV hybridization and marks a first step toward developing a multi-qubit platform based on planar KPO systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient state preparation for the quantum simulation of molecules in first quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum simulation of real molecules and materials is one of the most highly anticipated applications of quantum computing. Algorithms for simulating electronic structure using a first-quantized plane wave representation are especially promising due to their asymptotic efficiency. However, previous proposals for preparing initial states for these simulation algorithms scale poorly with the size of the basis set. We address this shortcoming by showing how to efficiently map states defined in a Gaussian type orbital basis to a plane wave basis with a scaling that is logarithmic in the number of plane waves. Our key technical result is a proof that molecular orbitals constructed from Gaussian type basis functions can be compactly represented in a plane wave basis using matrix product states. While we expect that other approaches could achieve the same logarithmic scaling with respect to basis set size, our proposed state preparation technique is also highly efficient in practice. For example, in a series of numerical experiments on small molecules, we find that our approach allows us to prepare an approximation to the Hartree-Fock state using orders of magnitude fewer non-Clifford gates than a naive approach. By resolving the issue of state preparation, our work allows for the first quantum simulation of molecular systems whose end-to-end complexity is truly sublinear in the basis set size.</description>

      <title>Exploring quantum ergodicity of unitary evolution through the Krylov approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in characterizing the complexity of quantum evolutions of interacting many-body systems. When a time-independent Hamiltonian governs the dynamics, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful tool. For unitary evolutions like kicked systems or Trotterized dynamics, a similar formulation based on the Arnoldi approach has been proposed yielding a new notion of quantum ergodicity [P. Suchsland, R. Moessner, and P. W. Claeys, Phys. Rev. B 111, 014309 (2025)]. In this work, we show that this formulation is robust for observing the transition from integrability to chaos in both autonomous and kicked systems. Examples from random matrix theory and spin chains are shown in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a cyclic quantum battery model, based on an interacting bipartite system, weakly coupled to a thermal bath. The working cycle of the battery consists of four strokes: system thermalization, disconnection of subsystems, ergotropy extraction, and reconnection. The thermal bath acts as a charger in the thermalization stroke, while ergotropy extraction is possible because the ensuing thermal state is no longer passive after the disconnection stroke. Focusing on the case of two interacting qubits, we show that phase coherence, in the presence of non-trivial correlations between the qubits, can be exploited to reach working regimes with efficiency higher than 50% while providing finite ergotropy. Our protocol is illustrated through a simple and feasible circuit model of a cyclic superconducting quantum battery. Furthermore, we simulate the considered cycle on superconducting IBM quantum machines. The good agreement between the theoretical and simulated results strongly suggests that our scheme for cyclic quantum batteries can be successfully realized in superconducting quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Approximating exponentials of commutators by optimized product formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trotter product formulas constitute a cornerstone quantum Hamiltonian simulation technique. However, the efficient implementation of Hamiltonian evolution of nested commutators remains an under explored area. In this work, we construct optimized product formulas of orders 3 to 6 approximating the exponential of a commutator of two arbitrary operators in terms of the exponentials of the operators involved. The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives. They can also be used as basic methods in recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation. We expect this research will improve the efficiency of quantum control protocols, as well as quantum algorithms such as the Zassenhaus-based product formula, Magnus operator-based time-dependent simulation, and product formula schemes with modified potentials.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Polymorphisms in Non-Commutative Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a parallel between commutative and non-commutative polymorphisms. Our emphasis is the applications to conditional distributions from stochastic processes. In the classical case, both the measures and the positive definite kernels are scalar valued. But the non-commutative framework (as motivated by quantum theory) dictates a setting where instead now both the measures (in the form of quantum states), and the positive definite kernels, are operator valued. The non-commutative theory entails a systematic study of positive operator valued measures, abbreviated POVMs. And quantum states (normal states) are indexed by normalized positive trace-class operators. In the non-commutative theory, the parallel to the commutative/scalar valued theory helps us understand entanglement in quantum information. A further implication of our study of the non-commutative framework will entail an interplay between the two cases, scalar valued, vs operator valued.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion-based Parameter Generation for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that shows promise in efficiently solving the MaxCut problem, a representative example of combinatorial optimization. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the parameter optimization pipeline, where the parameter initialization strategy is nontrivial due to the non-convex and complex optimization landscapes characterized by issues with low-quality local minima. Recent inspiration comes from the diffusion of classical neural network parameters, which has demonstrated that neural network training can benefit from generating good initial parameters through diffusion models. Therefore, in this work, we formulate the problem of finding good initial parameters as a generative task and propose the initial parameter generation scheme through dataset-conditioned pre-trained parameter sampling. Concretely, the generative machine learning model, specifically the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), is trained to learn the distribution of pretrained parameters conditioned on the graph dataset. Intuitively, our proposed framework aims at effectively distilling knowledge from pre-trained parameters to generate well-performing initial parameters for QAOA. Compared to random parameter initialization, experiments on various-sized Max-Cut problem instances consistently show that our conditional DDPM is capable of improving the approximation ratio by as much as 14.4%, 11.0%, 11.4% and 7.49%, 8.31%, 6.08% on average for random, regular, and Watts-Strogatz graphs, respectively. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that the conditional DDPM trained on small problem instances can be extrapolated to larger ones, improving the approximation ratio by up to 28.4% and 12.1% on average.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Circuit Reusing and its Application in Randomized Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum learning tasks often leverage randomly sampled quantum circuits to characterize unknown systems. An efficient approach known as "circuit reusing," where each circuit is executed multiple times, reduces the cost compared to implementing new circuits. This work investigates the optimal reusing parameter that minimizes the variance of measurement outcomes for a given experimental cost. We establish a theoretical framework connecting the variance of experimental estimators with the reusing parameter R. An optimal R is derived when the implemented circuits and their noise characteristics are known. Additionally, we introduce a near-optimal reusing strategy that is applicable even without prior knowledge of circuits or noise, achieving variances close to the theoretical minimum. To validate our framework, we apply it to randomized benchmarking and analyze the optimal R for various typical noise channels. We further conduct experiments on a superconducting platform, revealing a non-linear relationship between R and the cost, contradicting previous assumptions in the literature. Our theoretical framework successfully incorporates this non-linearity and accurately predicts the experimentally observed optimal R. These findings underscore the broad applicability of our approach to experimental realizations of quantum learning protocols.</description>

      <title>Entangling power, gate typicality, and measurement-induced phase transitions</title>

Abstract: When subject to a non-local unitary evolution, qubits in a quantum circuit become increasingly entangled. Conversely, measurements applied to individual qubits lead to their disentanglement from the collective system. The extent of entanglement reduction depends on the frequency of local projective measurements. A delicate balance emerges between unitary evolution, which enhances entanglement, and measurements which diminish it. In the thermodynamic limit, there is a phase transition from volume law entanglement to area law entanglement at a critical value of measurement frequency. This phenomenon, occurring in hybrid quantum circuits with both unitary gates and measurements, is termed as measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We study the behavior of MIPT in circuits comprising of two qubit unitary gates parameterized by Cartan decomposition. We show that the entangling power and gate typicality of the two-qubit local unitaries employed in the circuit can be used to explain the behavior of global bipartite entanglement the circuit can sustain. When the two qubit gate throughout the circuit is the identity and measurements are the sole driver of the entanglement behavior, we obtain analytical estimate for the entanglement entropy that shows remarkable agreement with numerical simulations. We also find that the entangling power and gate typicality enable the classification of the two-qubit unitaries by different universality classes of phase transitions that can occur in the hybrid circuit. For all unitaries in a particular universality class, the transition from volume to area law of entanglement occurs with same exponent that characterizes the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Generalised Circuit Partitioning for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a new paradigm aimed at scaling up quantum computing via the interconnection of smaller quantum processing units (QPUs). Shared entanglement allows teleportation of both states and gates between QPUs. This leads to an attractive horizontal scaling of quantum processing power, which comes at the expense of the additional time and noise introduced by entanglement sharing protocols. Consequently, methods for partitioning quantum circuits across multiple QPUs should aim to minimise the amount of entanglement-based communication required between distributed QPUs. Existing protocols tend to focus primarily on optimising entanglement costs for gate teleportation or state teleportation to cover operations between QPUs, rather than both at the same time. The most general form of the problem should treat gate and state teleportation on the same footing, allowing minimal cost circuit partitions through a combination of the two. This work introduces a graph-based formulation which allows joint optimisation of gate and state teleportation cost, including extensions of gate teleportation which group gates together for distribution using common resources. The formulation permits low e-bit cost for a variety of circuit types. Using a basic genetic algorithm, improved performance over state-of-the-art methods is obtained in terms of both average e-bit cost and time scaling.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states of spin systems that can be represented with weighted graphs $G(V, E)$ are studied. The geometrical characteristics of these states are examined. We find that the velocity of quantum evolution is determined by the sum of the weighted degrees of the nodes in the graph, constructed by raising to the second power the weights in $G(V, E)$. The curvature depends on the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes in graphs constructed by raising the weights in $G(V, E)$ to the second and fourth powers. It also depends on the sum of the products of the weights of edges forming squares in graph $G(V, E)$. The torsion in addition is related to the sum of the products of the weights of edges in graph $G(V, E)$ forming triangles $S_3$. Geometric properties of quantum graph states and the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes have been calculated with quantum programming on IBM's quantum computer for the case of a spin chain.</description>

      <title>A universal neutral-atom quantum computer with individual optical addressing and non-destructive readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-13]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation may greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single-qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with 0.9(3)% loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure a state-of-the-art CZ fidelity of 99.73(3)% when excluding atom-loss events, which may be mitigated through erasure conversion. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</description>

Abstract: Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ans\"atze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</description>

      <title>DasAtom: A Divide-and-Shuttle Atom Approach to Quantum Circuit Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atom (NA) quantum systems are emerging as a leading platform for quantum computation, offering superior or competitive qubit count and gate fidelity compared to superconducting circuits and ion traps. However, the unique features of NA devices, such as long-range interactions, long qubit coherence time, and the ability to physically move qubits, present distinct challenges for quantum circuit compilation. In this paper, we introduce DasAtom, a novel divide-and-shuttle atom approach designed to optimise quantum circuit transformation for NA devices by leveraging these capabilities. DasAtom partitions circuits into subcircuits, each associated with a qubit mapping that allows all gates within the subcircuit to be directly executed. The algorithm then shuttles atoms to transition seamlessly from one mapping to the next, enhancing both execution efficiency and overall fidelity. For a 30-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), DasAtom achieves a 414x improvement in fidelity over the move-based algorithm Enola and a 10.6x improvement over the SWAP-based algorithm Tetris. Notably, this improvement is expected to increase exponentially with the number of qubits, positioning DasAtom as a highly promising solution for scaling quantum computation on NA platforms.</description>

      <title>Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalised thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we tighten a classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change and demonstrate that it also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrized quantum circuits are essential components of variational quantum algorithms. Until now, optical implementations of these circuits have relied solely on adjustable linear optical units. In this study, we demonstrate that using programmable nonlinearities, rather than linear optics, offers a more efficient method for constructing quantum optical circuits -- especially quantum neural networks. This approach significantly reduces the number of adjustable parameters and the circuit depth needed to achieve high-fidelity operation. Specifically, we explored a quantum optical neural network (QONN) architecture composed of meshes of two-mode interferometers programmable by adjustable Kerr-like nonlinearities. We assessed the capabilities of our quantum optical neural network architecture and compared its performance to previously studied architectures that use multimode linear optics units. Additionally, we suggest future research directions for improving programmable quantum optical circuits.</description>

      <title>Gate Efficient Composition of Hamiltonian Simulation and Block-Encoding with its Application on HUBO, Chemistry and Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a formalism which unifies Hamiltonian simulation techniques from different fields. This formalism leads to a competitive method to construct the Hamiltonian simulation with a comprehensible, simple-to-implement circuit generation technique. It leads to a gate decomposition and a scaling different from the usual strategy based on a Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) reformulation of the problem. It can significantly reduce the quantum circuit number of rotational gates, multi-qubit gates, and the circuit depth. This method leads to one exact Hamiltonian simulation for each summed term and Trotter step. Each of these Hamiltonian simulation unitary matrices also allows the construction of the non-exponential terms with a maximum of six unitary matrices to be Block-encoding (BE).
  The formalism is easy to apply to the widely studied Highorder Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO), fermionic transition Hamiltonian, and basic finite difference method instances. For the HUBO, our implementation exponentially reduces the number of gates for high-order cost functions with respect to the HUBO order. The individual electronic transitions are implemented without error for the second-quantization Fermionic Hamiltonian. Finite difference proposed matrix decompositions are straightforward, very versatile, and scale as the state-of-the-art proposals.</description>

      <title>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as a light source. Time-modulating driving stimulates it to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to those of other generation methods for propagating states, suggesting a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Circuit Quantisation from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting circuit quantisation conventionally starts from classical Euler-Lagrange circuit equations-of-motion. Invoking the correspondence principle yields a canonically quantised circuit description of circuit dynamics over a bosonic Hilbert space. This process has been very successful for describing experiments, but implicitly starts from the classical Ginsberg-Landau (GL) mean field theory for the circuit. Here we employ a different approach which starts from a microscopic fermionic Hamiltonian for interacting electrons, whose ground space is described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) many-body wavefuction that underpins conventional superconductivity. We introduce the BCS ground-space as a subspace of the full fermionic Hilbert space, and show that projecting the electronic Hamiltonian onto this subspace yields the standard Hamiltonian terms for Josephson junctions, capacitors and inductors, from which standard quantised circuit models follow. Importantly, this approach does not assume a spontaneously broken symmetry, which is important for quantised circuits that support superpositions of phases, and the phase-charge canonical commutation relations are derived from the underlying fermionic commutation properties, rather than imposed. By expanding the projective subspace, this approach can be extended to describe phenomena outside the BCS ground space, including quasiparticle excitations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a wide range of optimisers for solving the Fermi-Hubbard model using the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</description>

Abstract: In this short review we describe the process of designing a superconducting circuit device for quantum information applications. We discuss the factors that must be considered to implement a desired effective Hamiltonian on a device. We describe the translation between a device's physical layout, the circuit graph, and the effective Hamiltonian. We go over the process of electromagnetic simulation of a device layout to predict its behavior. We also discuss concerns such as connectivity, crosstalk suppression, and radiation shielding, and how they affect both on-chip design and enclosure structures. This paper provides an overview of the challenges in superconducting quantum circuit design and acts as a starter document for researchers working on any of these challenges.</description>

      <title>Fast pulsed photoemission from a double quantum well on a dielectric substrate as a dynamic process of inverse LEED leading to the generation of a charge and current density wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the rigorous quantum theory of the atomic photoeffect and the scenario of photoemission from a crystal as an inverse LEED process, pulsed photoemission from a flat thin-film photoemitter formed by a double quantum well on a dielectric substrate is investigated. The spatiotemporal dependences of the charge and current densities are calculated using the density matrix method. Asymptotic estimates are made in terms of the evolution of wave packets and the concepts of the extreme phase and fastest descent. The possibility of generating charge and current density waves as a result of the population and decay of quasi-stationary states of a doublet of a double quantum well under photoexcitation of electrons in conducting layers from inside this well is shown. For comparison, calculations were made for photoemission from a metal film on a substrate without a heterostructure: the double-well heterostructure increases, stabilizes, and extends the photocurrent pulse. A comparison of the contributions of the outgoing and incoming waves of the inverse LEED problem is made, and the relative smallness of the contribution of the incoming wave is quantitatively demonstrated</description>

      <title>Quantization of Visible Light by a Ni$_2$ Molecular Optical Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings molecule.The composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Generating graph states with a single quantum emitter and the minimum number of fusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph states are the key resources for measurement- and fusion-based quantum computing with photons, yet their creation is experimentally challenging. We optimize a hybrid graph-state generation scheme using a single quantum emitter and linear optics Bell-state measurements, called fusions. We first generate a restricted class of states from a single quantum emitter and then apply fusions to create a target graph state, where we use a dynamic programming approach to find the construction that requires the lowest possible number of fusions. Our analysis yields a lookup table for constructing $\sim 2.8\times 10^7$ non-isomorphic graph states with the minimum number of fusions. The lookup table covers all graph states with up to eight qubits and several other ones with up to 14 qubits. We present construction protocols of selected graph states and provide the lookup table. For large graph states that are not in the lookup table, we derive bounds for the required number of fusions using graph-theoretic properties. Finally, we use the lookup table to search for the best graph codes for loss-tolerant encodings, given a fixed number of fusions for their construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnon blockade is a fundamental quantum phenomenon for generating single-magnon state, which gradually becomes one of the candidates for quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme to generate the magnon blockade in a hybrid system consisting of a YIG micromagnet and a skyrmion. Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the skyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived, and the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified. Under the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter regimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field intensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced, effectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of high-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching. Furthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade, revealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional magnon blockade. This scheme provides a versatile all-magnetic platform for generating high purity single-magnon sources.</description>

      <title>Singular transport in non-equilibrium strongly internal-coupled 1D tilted field spin-1/2 chain</title>

Abstract: Non-equilibrium spin-chain systems have been attracting increasing interest in energy transport. This work studies a one-dimensional non-equilibrium Ising chain immersed in a tilted magnetic field, every spin contacts a Boson reservoir with the dissipative system-environment interaction. We analytically investigate the dynamics and the steady-state energy transport taking advantage of the Born-Markov-secular master equation. In the longitudinal field, one can find that the non dissipative $N^\prime$ spins decompose the spin chain into $N^\prime +1$ independent subchains and block the heat currents from the hot end to the cool end. Moreover, for the non-dissipative $\mu$th spin, its nearest two bulk spins become the nodal spins in the subchains and have the corresponding energy correction of $\pm J_{\mu-1,\mu}$ and $\pm J_{\mu,\mu+1}$ depending on the excited/ground state of the $\mu$th spin. Therefore, a magnetically controlled heat modulator can be designed by adjusting the direction of the magnetic field in which the non-dissipative spin is located. For the transverse field case, the whole Hilbert space of the chain can always be divided into two independent subspaces regardless of whether the bulk spin is dissipative. This work provides new insight into the dynamics and energy transport of the dissipative Ising model.</description>

      <title>von Neumann entropy and quantum version of thermodynamic entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The debate whether the von Neumann (VN) entropy is a suitable quantum version of the thermodynamic (TH) entropy has a long history. In this regard, we briefly review some of the main reservations about the VN entropy and explain that the objections about its time-invariance and subadditivity properties can be addressed convincingly. In a broader context, we here analyze in detail whether and when the VN entropy is the same or equivalent to the TH entropy. We find that the VN entropy of a large isolated system is equivalent to its TH entropy if the system is in a mixed state described by a microcanonical (MC) ensemble. This equivalence also holds for open system and subsystem if the full system (i.e. system-bath or subsystem-bath combination) is in a mixed state described by an MC ensemble or in a {\it typical} pure state (or if the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis}, {\it ETH}, holds for the full system). Unlike isolated and open system, demonstrating the equivalence for a subsystem is not straightforward. We take a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model to numerically show that, if the full system is in a pure state, then the VN entropy of a subsystem is equivalent to its TH entropy if the {\it ETH} holds for the full system. We also demonstrate that this equivalence always works (irrespective of whether the {\it ETH} holds) if the full system is in a mixed state describe by an MC ensemble.</description>

      <title>Empirical Coordination of Separable Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of empirical coordination for quantum correlations. Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. Empirical coordination is thus a natural framework for quantum systems. Focusing on the cascade network, the optimal coordination rates are established, indicating the minimal resources required to simulate on average a quantum state. As we consider a network with classical communication links, superposition cannot be maintained, hence the quantum correlations are separable (i.e., a convex combination of product states). This precludes entanglement. Providing the users with shared randomness, before communication begins, does not affect the optimal rates for empirical coordination. We begin with a rate characterization for a basic two-node network, and then generalize to a cascade network. The special case of a network with an isolated node is considered as well. The results can be further generalized to other networks as our analysis includes a generic achievability scheme. The optimal rate formula involves optimization over a collection of state extensions. This is a unique feature of the quantum setting, as the classical parallel does not include optimization. As demonstrated through examples, the performance depends heavily on the choice of decomposition. We further discuss the consequences of our results for quantum cooperative games.</description>

      <title>Universal pulses for superconducting qudit ladder gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qudits, generalizations of qubits to multi-level quantum systems, offer enhanced computational efficiency by encoding more information per lattice cell, avoiding costly swap operations and providing even exponential speedup in some cases. Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate operations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While analytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast gates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due to the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from additional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse construction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between adjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in $SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a four-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite detuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise analytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform existing methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error scaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of parameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits demonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes aiming for $10^{-4}$ error. This method provides a scalable solution for improving qudit control and can be broadly applied to other quantum systems with ladder structures or operations involving multiple ancillary levels.</description>

      <title>Spectral Property of Magnetic Quantum Walk on Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate a model of magnetic quantum walk on a general hypercube. We first construct a set of unitary involutions associated with a magnetic potential $\nu$ by using quantum Bernoulli noises. And then, with these unitary involutions as the magnetic shift operators, we define the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ for the model, where $\nu$ is the magnetic potential. We examine the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of the evolution operator $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ and obtain their representations in terms of the coin operator system of the model. We show that the point-spectrum and approximate-spectrum of $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ are completely independent of the magnetic potential $\nu$ although $\mathsf{W}^{(\nu)}$ itself is dependent of the magnetic potential $\nu$. Our work might suggest that a quantum walk perturbed by a magnetic field can have spectral stability with respect to the magnetic potential.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of a recently proposed efficiently implementable Lindbladian designed to prepare the Gibbs states in the setting of weakly interacting fermionic systems. We show that at any temperature, the Lindbladian spectral gap for even parity observables is lower bounded by a constant that is independent of the system size, when the interaction strength (e.g., the on-site interaction strength for the Fermi-Hubbard model) is below a constant threshold, which is also independent of the system size. This leads to a mixing time estimate that is at most linear in the system size, thus showing that the corresponding Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Pauli Measurement-Based Shadow Tomography in Direct Fidelity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A constant number of random Clifford measurements allows the classical shadow protocol to perform Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) with high precision. However, estimating properties of an unknown quantum state is expected to be more feasible with random Pauli measurements than with random Clifford measurements in the near future. Inspired by the importance sampling technique applied to sampling Pauli measurements for DFE, we show that similar strategies can be derived from classical shadows. Specifically, we describe efficient methods using Pauli measurements to perform DFE with GHZ and W states, establishing tighter bounds ($\approx \times 14.22$ for GHZ, $\approx \times 16$ for W) on the number of measurements required for desired precision.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement as an extremal Kirkwood-Dirac nonreality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between various different forms of nonclassicality and their resource character is of great importance in quantum foundation and quantum information. Here, we discuss a quantitative link between quantum entanglement and the anomalous or nonclassical nonreal values of Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability, in a bipartite setting. We first construct an entanglement monotone for a pure bipartite state based on the nonreality of the KD quasiprobability defined over a pair of orthonormal bases in which one of them is a product, and optimizations over these bases. It admits a closed expression as a Schur-concave function of the state of the subsystem having a form of nonadditive quantum entropy. We then construct a bipartite entanglement monotone for generic quantum states using the convex roof extension. Its normalized value is upper bounded by the concurrence of formation, and for two-qubit systems, they are equal. We also derive lower and upper bounds in terms of different forms of uncertainty in the subsystem quantified respectively by an extremal trace-norm asymmetry and a nonadditive quantum entropy. The entanglement monotone can be expressed as the minimum total state disturbance due to a nonselective local binary measurement. Finally, we discuss its estimation using weak value measurement and classical optimization, and its connection with strange weak value and quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to Gaussian environments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using the Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on a neutral atom quantum computer. We test the ground-state energy of spin systems with up to 15 spins. Two different encoding schemes are used: an individual spin encoding where each spin is represented by one qubit, and an efficient Gray code encoding scheme which only requires a number of qubits that scales with the logarithm of the number of spins. This more efficient encoding, together with zero noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.</description>

Abstract: We present a general non-perturbative method to determine the exact perturbed steady state of open quantum systems, in terms of the eigenmodes of the unperturbed system. The perturbation may be time-independent or periodic, and of arbitrarily large amplitude. Using a generalized inverse and two diagonalizations, we construct an operator that generates the entire dependence of the steady state on the perturbation parameter. The approach also enables exact analytic operations-such as differentiation, integration, and ensemble averaging-with respect to the parameter, even when the steady state is computed numerically. We apply the method to three non-trivial open quantum systems, showing that it achieves exact results, with a computational speedup for calculations requiring large sampling, such as ensemble averaging, compared to sampling-based approaches.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driving a quantum many-body system can drastically change its properties, leading to exotic non-equilibrium states of matter without a static analog. In this scenario, parametric resonances and the complexity of an interacting many-body system are pivotal in establishing non-equilibrium states. We report on a Floquet-engineered transverse field Ising model for the controlled propagation in one dimension of spin waves. The underlying mechanisms behind our proposal rely on high-frequency drivings using characteristic parametric resonances of the spin lattice. Many-body resonances modulating spin-sping exchange or individual spin gaps inhibit interactions between spins thus proving a mechanism for controlling spin-wave propagation and a quantum switch. Our schemes may have applications in coupling-decoupling schemes for system-reservoir interaction, and routing in quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

Abstract: Distinguishing resource states from resource-free states is a fundamental task in quantum information. We have approached the state detection problem through a hypothesis testing framework, with the alternative hypothesis set comprising resource-free states in a general context. Consequently, we derived the optimal exponential decay rate of the failure probability for detecting a given $n$-tensor product state when the resource-free states are separable states, positive partial transpose (PPT) states, or the convex hull of the set of stabilizer states. This optimal exponential decay rate is determined by the minimum of the reverse relative entropy, indicating that this minimum value serves as the general detectability measure. The key technique of this paper is a quantum version of empirical distribution.</description>

      <title>Strong and noise-tolerant entanglement in dissipative optomechanics</title>

Abstract: Macroscopic entanglement, as critical quantum resources in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in optomechanical systems with purely dispersive coupling over the past decades. However, quantum entanglement, induced by purely dissipative coupling, remains unexplored. In this work, we study quantum entanglement in a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer, where the dispersive and the dissipative coupling can be arbitrarily switched on and off. With current experimental parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power with the purely dispersive (dissipative) coupling. Further, we find that quantum entanglement generated by purely dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more noise-tolerant than that generated by purely dispersive coupling. When both couplings coexist, entanglement is weakened due to interference. Our findings provide a promising path to engineer strong and noise-tolerant quantum entanglement in purely dissipative quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Upper Limit of Backflash Attack in Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) theoretically provides information-theoretic security based on physical laws. However, imperfections in practice lead to the possibility of quantum hacking on the QKD implementation, especially the passive attacks that are difficult to be detected. In this paper, we study experimentally and theoretically the upper limit of a backflash attack, as one of the vital passive attacks, on a fiber-based QKD system. We experimentally demonstrate the backflash attack on a full equipped fiber-based QKD receiver to show its feasibility and limited distinguish ratio of decoding. More importantly, we have developed a simulation model to analyze the maximum distinguish ratio of decoding can be achieved considering the wide-spectrum feature of backflash photons, which indicates that Eve can extract effective key information from 95.7% of the backflash photons. Consequently, the secure key rate of the decoy-state BB84 QKD system under backflash attack is calculated. This work provides a general methodology to comprehensively evaluate the effect of the backflash attack on a QKD system.</description>

      <title>Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal breaking system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magneto-nonlinear Hall effect is known to be intrinsic and requires time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that a new type of magneto-nonlinear Hall effect can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a geometric quantity associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking system by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In information theory, we often use intersection and union of the typical sets to analyze various communication problems. However, in the quantum setting it is not very clear how to construct a measurement which behaves analogously to intersection and union of the typical sets. In this work, we construct a projection operator which behaves very similarly to intersection and union of the typical sets. Our construction relies on the Jordan's lemma. Using this construction we study the problem of communication over authenticated classical-quantum channels and derive its capacity. As another application of our construction, we also study the problem of quantum asymmetric composite hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>A call for frugal modelling: two case studies involving molecular spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13618v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $&gt;4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</description>

      <title>Disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and a precursor of chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems, such as those with disorder or external kick terms, despite their large $N$ behavior differing from that of typical chaotic systems. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. This adjusted von Neumann entropy is the negative of the relative entropy with respect to the uniform state on the C*-algebra, up to an additive constant. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <title>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2&gt;0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, improvements are introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas by incorporating the quantum nature of phase space, directly linked to the uncertainty principle. These improved models leverage the recently developed concepts of quantum phase space and phase space representation of quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and quantum statistical mechanics is used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas. 
  Analytic expressions for thermodynamic quantities - including the grand canonical potential, particle number, internal energy, Von Neumann entropy, and pressure are derived, alongside the corresponding thermodynamic equations of state for both bosons and fermions. These corrections are particularly significant at low temperatures and in confined volumes, where quantum effects such as shape and size become prominent. The results also establish a direct link between thermodynamic functions and the quantum statistical variances of momenta. 
  Importantly, the improved models recover well-known classical relations of the ideal gas in the high-temperature and large-volume limits, ensuring consistency with classical physics. By addressing quantum corrections and their thermodynamic implications, this work provides a foundation for further applications in nanoscale systems, quantum gases, low-temperature physics, utra-cold physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Moment Quantum Fluctuations and Quantum Equivalence Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The second-order moment quantum fluctuations or uncertainties are mass-dependent, and the incompatibility between the quantum uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle is at the second-order moment (variation) level, but not the first-order moment (mean) level. To reconcile the two fundamental principles, we find that the second-order moment quantum fluctuations are actually distinguished into two parts: a dynamic part and a geometric part. The dynamic part is indeed mass-dependent and governed by a non-zero Hamiltonian in a non-general-covariant inertial frame, and the geometric part is mass-independent and comes from coarse-graining and/or geometric effects. The dynamic part is coordinate dependent, it can be canceled away by a coordinate transformation, and hence it plays no role in general covariant theories whose Hamiltonian automatically vanishes. However, the geometric part is valid for general coordinate, and it can not be eliminated by a coordinate transformation. On the contrary, the geometric part of second-order moment fluctuation of quantum spacetime leads to coordinate transformation anomaly, which induces an effective Einstein's gravity theory. The geometric part is mass-independent and universal, so it is only this part measures the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuation of the spacetime, while the dynamic part plays no role in the general covariant description. The observation generalizes the classical equivalence principle to the quantum level. And according to the principle, a general covariant theory with only geometric part quantum fluctuation, i.e. a non-linear sigma model, is proposed as a theory of a material quantum reference frame system. The effects of the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuations in the material quantum reference system and its implications to an effective gravity theory are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Unusual energy spectra of matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In approximate ground states obtained from imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum of the state -- its decomposition into exact energy eigenstates -- falls off exponentially with the energy. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in the bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, independent of boundary or dimensionality, and are also observed in neural network wavefunctions. The unusual spectra can have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. The energy variance, which can be used to extrapolate observables to eliminate truncation error, is subject to these large fluctuations when sampled. Nevertheless, we devise a sampling-based variance approach which gives excellent and efficient extrapolations.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQR) are emerging quantum precision sensing platforms designed for receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. It relies on creation of Rydberg atoms from normal atoms by exciting one or more electrons to a very high energy level, thereby making the atom sensitive to RF signals. RAQRs realize RF-to-optical conversions based on light-atom interactions relying on the so called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Aulter-Townes splitting (ATS), so that the desired RF signal can be read out optically. The large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms associated with rich choices of Rydberg states and various modulation schemes facilitate an ultra-high sensitivity ($\sim$ nV/cm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and an ultra-broadband tunability (direct-current to Terahertz). RAQRs also exhibit compelling scalability and lend themselves to the construction of innovative, compact receivers. Initial experimental studies have demonstrated their capabilities in classical wireless communications and sensing. To fully harness their potential in a wide variety of applications, we commence by outlining the underlying fundamentals of Rydberg atoms, followed by the principles and schemes of RAQRs. Then, we overview the state-of-the-art studies from both physics and communication societies. Furthermore, we conceive Rydberg atomic quantum single-input single-output (RAQ-SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) schemes for facilitating the integration of RAQRs with classical wireless systems. Finally, we conclude with a set of potent research directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for the advection-diffusion equation and the Koopman-von Neumann approach to nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical dualities of spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08884</link>

Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</description>

      <title>Proof of the absence of local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that all systems, except for the known integrable systems, are nonintegrable, meaning that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. In particular, this result guarantees the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, which is a fundamental assumption for quantum many-body scarring. Furthermore, we give simple necessary conditions for integrability in an extended model of the bilinear-biquadratic model with anisotropic interactions. Our result has accomplished a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <title>Probing nonlocal correlations in magnetic rare-earth clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired super-resolution of fluorescent point-like sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental super-resolution of pairs of point-like fluorescent sources using a modified image inversion interferometer microscope. The technique is inspired by recent developments in the application of quantum parameter estimation theory to semiclassical imaging problems. We find that the image inversion technique requires special polarization filtering to account for the dipolar nature of the emission. Using an azimuthal polarizer, we obtain improvements in the Fisher information of point-source separation by over an order of magnitude relative to direct imaging. Unlike established super-resolution fluorescence techniques, the method does not require sequential photoswitching/blinking of the fluorophores, and thus could facilitate significant speed-ups for certain biological imaging/tracking tasks.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Exceptional Point in Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</description>

      <title>A Simplification Method for Inequality Constraints in Integer Binary Encoding HOBO Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel method for simplifying inequality constraints in Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulations. The proposed method addresses challenges associated with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, specifically the increased computational complexity and reduced solution accuracy caused by the introduction of slack variables and the resulting growth in auxiliary qubits. By efficiently integrating constraints, the method enhances the computational efficiency and accuracy of both quantum and classical solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments applied to combinatorial optimization problems. The results indicate that this method expands the applicability of quantum algorithms to high-dimensional problems and improves the practicality of classical optimization solvers for optimization problems involving inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unique Characteristics in Stark Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stark Many-Body Localization (MBL) is a phenomenon observed in quantum systems in the absence of disorder, where the presence of a linear potential, known as the Stark field, causes the localization. Our study aims to provide novel insight into the properties of Stark MBL and to discover unique entanglement characteristics specific to this phenomenon. The phase diagram analysis reveals different behavior with varying interaction strengths. Furthermore, we highlight the influence of domain wall structures on the breakdown of the entanglement entropy of the system. Moreover, the investigation of Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlator (OTOC) behavior demonstrates distinct responses to interactions based on domain wall configurations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Stark MBL and offer valuable insights into the entanglement properties of systems subjected to Stark potentials.</description>
