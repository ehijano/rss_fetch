      <title>Highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks contributing to divergent genomic evolution of human and chimpanzee brain development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergence during mammalian evolution of concordant and divergent traits of genomic regulatory networks encompassing ubiquitous, qualitatively nearly identical yet quantitatively distinct arrays of sequences of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for 716 proteins is reported. A vast majority of TFs (770 of 716; 98%) comprising protein constituents of these networks appear to share common Gene Ontology (GO) features of sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding (GO: 1990837). Genome-wide and individual chromosome-level analyses of 17,935 ATAC-seq-defined brain development regulatory regions (BDRRs) revealed nearly universal representations of TFBS for TF-constituents of these networks, TFBS densities of which appear consistently higher within thousands BDRRs of Modern Humans compare to Chimpanzee. Transposable elements (TE), including LTR/HERV, SINE/Alu, SVA, and LINE families, appear to harbor and spread genome-wide consensus regulatory nodes of identified herein highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks, selections of TFBS panels of which manifest individual chromosome-specific profiles and species-specific divergence patterns. Collectively, observations reported in this contribution highlight a previously unrecognized essential function of human genomic DNA sequences encoded by TE in providing genome-wide regulatory seed templates of highly conserved sequence-specific double-stranded DNA binding networks likely contributing to continuing divergent genomic evolution of human and chimpanzee brain development.</description>

      <title>Advances in practical k-mer sets: essentials for the curious</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of data structures for representing k-mer sets, which are fundamental in high-throughput sequencing analysis. It categorizes the methods into two main strategies: those using fingerprinting and hashing for compact storage, and those leveraging lexicographic properties for efficient representation. The paper reviews key operations supported by these structures, such as membership queries and dynamic updates, and highlights recent advancements in memory efficiency and query speed. A companion paper explores colored k-mer sets, which extend these concepts to integrate multiple datasets or genomes.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.
