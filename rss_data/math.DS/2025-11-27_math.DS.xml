      <title>Polish full groups preserving an infinite measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend some results of Carderi and Le Ma\^itre on full groups in the probability context to the infinite measure one: there exists at most one Polish group topology (refining the weak topology and coarser than the uniform topology) on an ergodic full group, and the orbit full group of a locally compact group acting in a Borel manner can be endowed with a Polish group topology. Moreover, orbit full groups are complete invariants for orbit equivalence. We then generalize a result from Le Ma\^itre on non-Polishability of the group of finitely supported bijections: the finitely supported elements of an ergodic full group carries a Polish group topology if and only if the associated full group comes from a countable equivalence relation. We finish with algebraic and topological results on ergodic (orbit) full groups concerning normal subgroups, contractibility and genericity of aperiodic elements.</description>

      <title>Spectral orthogonality of special flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral orthogonality problem for special flows built over irrational rotations under two different types of roof functions:
  1) the roof functions are real analytic.
  2) the roof functions are piecewise $C^1$ with one discontinuity. These flows are also known as von-Neumann flows.
  We show that if $\{T^f_\alpha\}$ is as in 1) and weak mixing, then for a $G_\delta$ dense set of $\beta$, we have that $\{T^f_\beta\}$ is weak-mixing and is spectrally orthogonal to $\{T^f_\alpha\}$. On the other hand, if $\{T^f_\alpha\}$ is as in 2), then for a full measure set of $\beta$, the flows $\{T^f_\alpha\}$ and $\{T^f_\beta\}$ are spectrally orthogonal.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of bounded-type Siegel polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rigidity of polynomials of arbitrary degree in the presence of neutral dynamics. Specifically, we focus on {non-renormalizable} (in the sense of Douady and Hubbard) complex polynomials of degree $d \geqslant 2$ that possess a Siegel disk of bounded type rotation number. We refer to such maps as {atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type}. In this setting, our main results are: (A) Atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type have locally connected Julia sets; (B) these Julia sets are quasiconformally rigid, i.e., they do not support invariant line fields; (C) any two combinatorially equivalent atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type coincide up to an affine change of coordinates. In particular, item (C) verifies the notorious {Combinatorial Rigidity Conjecture} for atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type and arbitrary degree. By bringing neutral Siegel dynamics into the picture, we extend the celebrated higher-degree rigidity theorems of Avila--Kahn--Lyubich--Shen and Kozlovski--van Strien, which until now applied only in the Yoccoz setting, i.e., for finitely many times renormalizable polynomials without irrationally indifferent periodic points.</description>

      <title>A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics.
  In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</description>

      <title>On the Periodic Orbits of the Dual Logarithmic Derivative Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the periodic behaviour of the dual logarithmic derivative operator $\mathcal{A}[f]=\mathrm{d}\ln f/\mathrm{d}\ln x$ in a complex analytic setting. We show that $\mathcal{A}$ admits genuinely nondegenerate period-$2$ orbits and identify a canonical explicit example. Motivated by this, we obtain a complete classification of all nondegenerate period-$2$ solutions, which are precisely the rational pairs $(c a x^{c}/(1-ax^{c}),\, c/(1-ax^{c}))$ with $ac\neq 0$. We further classify all fixed points of $\mathcal{A}$, showing that every solution of $\mathcal{A}[f]=f$ has the form $f(x)=1/(a-\ln x)$. As an illustration, logistic-type functions become pre-periodic under $\mathcal{A}$ after a logarithmic change of variables, entering the period-$2$ family in one iterate. These results give an explicit description of the low-period structure of $\mathcal{A}$ and provide a tractable example of operator-induced dynamics on function spaces.</description>

      <title>Fractal Analysis of Pseudo Foci in Piecewise Analytic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Minkowski dimension of spiral trajectories near a non-degenerate focus in analytic (smooth) systems is in one-to-one correspondence with the cyclicity of the focus in generic unfoldings. We give a complete fractal treatment, in terms of the Minkowski dimension and (non-)degeneracy, of spiral trajectories near pseudo foci of piecewise analytic systems. We hope these results will prove useful in the study of bifurcations of such pseudo foci through inherent geometry of associated spiral orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While studying the existence of wandering domains in complex dynamics, Astorg-Thaler posed a question concerning the distribution of bounded real sequences: for $\alpha&gt;1$ that has the Pisot property, is $\frac{\beta\ln\alpha}{\alpha-1}\in\mathbb{Q}$ necessary for the existence of an increasing sequence of integers $(n_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ such that $(n_{k+1}-\alpha n_k-\beta\ln n_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ converges to a cycle? When $\alpha$ is an algebraic number, we answer Astorg-Thaler's question in the affirmative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Bounded remainder sets, bounded distance equivalent cut-and-project sets, and equidecomposability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the measurable Hall's theorem due to Cie\'sla and Sabok to prove that (i) if two measurable sets $A,B \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of the same measure are bounded remainder sets with respect to a given irrational $d$-dimensional vector $\alpha$, then $A, B$ are equidecomposable with measurable pieces using translations from $\mathbb{Z} \alpha + \mathbb{Z}^d$; and (ii) given a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively, if two cut-and-project sets in $\mathbb{R}^m$ obtained from Riemann measurable windows $W, W' \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are bounded distance equivalent, then $W, W'$ are equidecomposable with measurable pieces using translations from $p_2(\Gamma)$. We also prove by a different method that for one-dimensional cut-and-project sets the pieces can be chosen Riemann measurable.</description>

      <title>Behavior-induced oscillations in epidemic outbreaks with distributed memory: beyond the linear chain trick using numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We considered a model for an infectious disease outbreak, when the depletion of susceptible individuals is negligible, and assumed that individuals adapt their behavior according to the information they receive about new cases. In line with the information index approach, we supposed that individuals react to past information according to a memory kernel that is continuously distributed in the past. We analyzed equilibria and their stability, with analytical results for selected cases. Thanks to the recently developed pseudospectral approximation of delay equations, we studied numerically the long-term dynamics of the model for memory kernels defined by gamma distributions with a general non-integer shape parameter, extending the analysis beyond what is allowed by the linear chain trick. In agreement with previous studies, we showed that behavior adaptation alone can cause sustained waves of infections even in an outbreak scenario, and notably in the absence of other processes like demographic turnover, seasonality, or waning immunity. Our analysis gives a more general insight into how the period and peak of epidemic waves depend on the shape of the memory kernel and how the level of minimal contact impacts the stability of the behavior-induced positive equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The Enriques surface of minimal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lehmer's number $\lambda_{10}$ is the smallest dynamical degree greater than $1$ that can occur for an automorphism of an algebraic surface. We show that $\lambda_{10}$ cannot be realized by automorphisms of Enriques surfaces in odd characteristic, extending a result of Oguiso over the complex numbers. In contrast, we prove that in characteristic $2$ there exists a unique Enriques surface that admits an automorphism with dynamical degree $\lambda_{10}$. We also provide explicit equations for the surface as well as for all conjugacy classes of automorphisms that realize $\lambda_{10}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal control problem for a control-affine system, where we want to minimize the $L^1$ norm of the control. First, we show how Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to this problem and we divide the extremal trajectories into two categories: regular and singular extremals. Then, we obtain a strong generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition for singular extremals and we show that this condition together with the absence of conjugate points is sufficient to ensure local strong optimality. We provide also some geometric examples where we apply our results. Finally, we prove that generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition is necessary for optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of point vortices on the Mobius band and Klein bottle. Since these are non-orientable surfaces, the standard Hamiltonian approach does not apply. We therefore begin by establishing a modified Hamiltonian approach which works for arbitrary non-orientable surfaces, through describing the phase space, the Hamiltonian and the local equations of motion. We use a combination of twisted functions and oriented double covers to adapt some of the known notions of vortex dynamics to non-orientable surfaces. For both of the surfaces of interest, we write Hamiltonian-type equations of vortex motion explicitly and follow that by the description of relative equilibria and an investigation of the motion of one and two vortices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fine local scaling properties of a class of self-affine fractal sets called Gatzouras-Lalley carpets. More precisely, we establish a formula for the Assouad spectrum of all Gatzouras-Lalley carpets as the concave conjugate of an explicit piecewise-analytic function combined with a simple parameter change. Our formula implies a number of novel properties for the Assouad spectrum not previously observed for dynamically invariant sets; in particular, the Assouad spectrum can be a non-trivial differentiable function on the entire domain $(0,1)$ and can be strictly concave on open intervals. Our proof introduces a general framework for covering arguments using techniques developed in the context of multifractal analysis, including the method of types from large deviations theory and Lagrange duality from optimisation theory.</description>

Abstract: We show that given a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$, and projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively, cut-and-project sets obtained using Jordan measurable windows $W$ and $W'$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of equal measure are bounded distance equivalent only if $W$ and $W'$ are equidecomposable by translations in $p_2(\Gamma)$. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit description of the bounded distance equivalence classes in the hulls of simple quasicrystals. A corrigendum is appended at the end of the paper.</description>

Abstract: We observe that a particular first integral of the partially-averaged system in the secular theory of the three-body problem appears also as an important conserved quantity of integrable Kepler billiards. In this note we illustrate their common roots with the projective dynamics of the two-center problem. We then combine these two aspects to define a class of integrable billiard systems on surfaces of constant curvature.</description>

      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Liv\v{s}ic regularity for random and sequential dynamics through transfer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Liv\v{s}ic-type regularity results of coboundary representations for non-autonomous dynamical systems. Our results have an abstract nature and apply to several important specific situations, such as (higher-dimensional) random or sequential piecewise expanding maps and subshifts of finite type, which have applications to Markov interval maps and to finite state inhomogeneous elliptic Markov shifts, via symbolic representations. We also obtain results for some classes of non-autonomous hyperbolic systems. Our results can be seen as non-autonomous versions of a recent result obtained by Morris. However, we emphasize that our proof differs from the one mentioned previously even in the deterministic case. Finally, we show that our results provide a more relaxed characterization for having variance growth of Birkhoff sums on random and sequential dynamical systems; we show that such growth can fail only when the underlying functions are a coboundary without special restrictions on the regularity of the coboundary. For random systems, we show that this is equivalent to having a coboundary with bounded ``variation", but for sequential systems it turns out that this is no longer true, as demonstrated by examples.</description>

      <title>On intertwined polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be polynomials of degree at least two over $\mathbb C$. We say that $A_1$ and $A_2$ are intertwined if the endomorphism $(A_1, A_2)$ of $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$ given by $(z_1, z_2) \mapsto (A_1(z_1), A_2(z_2))$ admits an irreducible periodic curve that is neither a vertical nor a horizontal line. We denote by $\mathrm{Inter}(A)$ the set of all polynomials $B$ such that some iterate of $B$ is intertwined with some iterate of $A$. In this paper, we prove a conjecture of Favre and Gauthier describing the structure of $\mathrm{Inter}(A)$. We also obtain a bound on the possible periods of periodic curves for endomorphisms $(A_1, A_2)$ in terms of the sizes of the symmetry groups of the Julia sets of $A_1$ and $A_2$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Word Maps on Groups and Polynomial Maps on Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of Fatou and Julia sets in the context of word maps on complex Lie groups and polynomial maps on finite-dimensional associative $\mathbb C$-algebras. For the group-theoretic question, we investigate the dynamics of the power map $x \mapsto x^{M}$ on the Lie group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$, where $M \geq 2$ is an integer. For the algebra-related question, we study polynomial self-maps of $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathbb C)$ induced by monic polynomials in one variable. In both cases, we pin down the explicit description of the Fatou and Julia sets. We also show that there does not exist any wandering Fatou component of the pair $(p,\mathrm M_n(\mathbb C))$ where $p\in\mathbb C[z]$ is a monic polynomial of degree $\geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies homothetic and more general weighted averages for flows. Absolutely continuous convolutions of singular weights are considered, thereby strengthening Kozlov-Treshchev's result on nonuniform averages for ergodic flows. The concept of almost mixing, formulated in terms of homothetic weighted average convergences, is proposed. An example of a non-mixing almost mixing flow is given. It is proven that rigid flows are not almost mixing.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Fast Traveling Pulses in Singularly Perturbed Nonlocal Neural Fields With Heaviside Nonlinearities: a Complete Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of fast traveling pulse solutions to the singularly perturbed neural field system with linear feedback and Heaviside nonlinearity structure within a spatial convolution. Although a long-standing open problem, the pulse is well-accepted to often exist based on its original singular construction, closed form when it exists, and follow-ups, but prior to this study, there has not been a proof that overcomes the difficulties of (i) solving for the fast speed and width functions using the implicit function theorem at $\epsilon=0$ and (ii) tracking the resultant formal homoclinic orbit near its singular orbit during fast, slow, and mixed time scales. First, we provide new, first-order approximations of the pulse speed and width. We then show that the formal pulse is close to the front and back at threshold crossing points and that the Hausdorff distance between the formal pulse and the singular homoclinic orbit converges to zero, demonstrating that the formal pulse is a true solution to the original system. Broadly, our methods provide insight into nonlocal geometric singular perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>On the reduction of stochastic chemical reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear noise approximation (LNA) describes the random fluctuations from the mean-field concentrations of a chemical reaction network due to intrinsic noise. It is also used as a test probe to determine the accuracy of reduced formulations of the chemical master equation and to understand the relationship between timescale disparity and model reduction in stochastic environments. Although several reduced LNAs have been proposed, they have not been placed into a general theory concerning the accuracy of reduced LNAs derived from center manifold and singular perturbation theory. This has made it difficult to understand why certain reductions of the master or Langevin equations fail or succeed. In this work, we develop a deeper understanding of slow manifold projection in the linear noise regime by answering a straightforward but open question: In the presence of eigenvalue disparity, does the appropriate oblique projection of the LNA onto the slow eigenspace accurately approximate the first and second moments of complete LNA, and if not, why? Although most studies concentrate on the role of eigenvalue disparity arising from the drift matrix, we go further and examine the interplay between disparate ``drift" eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrix, the latter of which may or may not be disparate. Furthermore, we place the previously established reductions of the LNA into a more general framework and formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the projected LNA to accurately approximate the first and second moments of the complete LNA.</description>

      <title>Invariant Sets and Hyperbolic Closed Reeb Orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a hyperbolic (or, more generally, isolated as an invariant set) closed Reeb orbit on the dynamics of a Reeb flow on the $(2n-1)$-dimensional standard contact sphere, extending two results previously known for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms to the Reeb setting. In particular, we show that under very mild dynamical convexity type assumptions, the presence of one hyperbolic closed orbit implies the existence of infinitely many simple closed Reeb orbits. The second main result of the paper is a higher-dimensional Reeb analogue of the Le Calvez-Yoccoz theorem, asserting that no closed orbit of a non-degenerate dynamically convex Reeb pseudo-rotation is locally maximal, i.e., isolated as an invariant set. The key new ingredient of the proofs is a Reeb variant of the crossing energy theorem.</description>

      <title>On the Barcode Entropy of Reeb Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue investigating connections between Floer theory and dynamics of Hamiltonian systems, focusing on the barcode entropy of Reeb flows. Barcode entropy is the exponential growth rate of the number of not-too-short bars in the Floer or symplectic homology persistence module. The key novel result is that the barcode entropy is bounded from below by the topological entropy of any hyperbolic invariant set. This, combined with the fact that the topological entropy bounds the barcode entropy from above, established by Fender, Lee and Sohn, implies that in dimension three the two types of entropy agree. The main new ingredient of the proof is a variant of the Crossing Energy Theorem for Reeb flows.</description>

      <title>On Random Batch Methods (RBM) for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, the underlying random fluctuations are non-Gaussian, particularly in contexts where heavy-tailed data distributions arise. A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for L\'evy noise, which accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch Method for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy noises (RBM-L\'evy), which can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et al. J Compt Phys, 2020]. In our RBM-L\'evy algorithm, $N$ particles are randomly grouped into small batches of size $p$, and interactions occur only within each batch for a short time. Then one reshuffles the particles and continues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by replacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force, RBM-L\'evy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original interacting particle system, even at the appearance of the L\'evy jump. We rigorously prove this convergence in Wasserstein distance, assuming either a finite or infinite second moment of the L\'evy measure. Some numerical examples are given to verify our convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform-Grid Markov Chain Approximation of Continuous Processes with Time-Linear Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.</description>
