      <title>Pointed Hopf algebras revisited, with a view from tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf algebras appear in connection with various problems in Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, mainly through their categoriesof representations, which are examples of tensor categories. In recent years, there have been major advances in the classification of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over the complex numbers, especially when restricted to the pointed case. In this survey, we aim to review the main results in this direction, stating the classification theorems recently obtained and the problems still open, and describing the tools needed to solve the problem by means of the so-called Lifting Method of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider.
  We will highlight a more categorical point of view related to these classification results, which offers for a better description of the so-called liftings up to involving cocycle deformations, and which in turn allows certain problems to be reduced to the associated graded pointed Hopf algebras. We will emphasise this point of view with applications to other contexts related to the aforementioned pointed Hopf algebras, such as finite pointed tensor categories, Hopf algebras that do not satisfy the Chevalley property and their finite-dimensional Nichols algebras, and finally module categories over the categories of representations of pointed Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Abstract Cluster Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a framework for encoding cluster combinatorics using categorical methods. We give a definition of an abstract cluster structure, which captures the essence of cluster mutation at a tropical level and show that cluster algebras, cluster varieties, cluster categories and surface models all have associated abstract cluster structures. For the first two classes, we also show that they can be constructed from abstract cluster structures.
  By defining a suitable notion of morphism of abstract cluster structures, we introduce a category of these and show that it has several desirable properties, such as initial and terminal objects and finite products and coproducts. We also prove that rooted cluster morphisms of cluster algebras give rise to morphisms of the associated abstract cluster structures, so that our framework includes a version of the extant category of cluster algebras.
  We can do more, however, because we can relate different types of representation of abstract cluster structures (cluster algebra, varieties, categories) directly via morphisms of their associated abstract cluster structures, even though no direct map from e.g. a cluster category to the associated cluster algebra is possible.
  In fact, we do much of the above in the setting of abstract quantum cluster structures, with some analysis of the difference between the category of these and that of the unquantized version. In order to show the relationship between abstract quantum cluster structures and quantum cluster algebras, we reformulate the usual construction of the latter in a way that is more amenable to our purposes and which we expect will be of independent interest and use.</description>

      <title>Free Inhomogeneous Wreath Product of Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the free inhomogeneous wreath product of compact matrix quantum groups, which generalizes the free wreath product (Bichon 2004). We use this to present a general technique to determine quantum automorphism groups of connected graphs in terms of their maximal biconnected subgraphs, provided that we have sufficient information about their quantum automorphism groups. We show that this requirement is met for forests, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs leading to algorithms to compute the quantum automorphism groups of these graphs.</description>

      <title>An outline of shifted Poisson structures and deformation quantisation in derived differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.07622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain how to translate several recent results in derived algebraic geometry to derived differential geometry. These concern shifted Poisson structures on NQ-manifolds, Lie groupoids, smooth stacks and derived generalisations, and include existence and classification of various deformation quantisations.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the shadow world: quantum $6j$-symbols for Verma modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of invariants of links associated to infinite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ using graphical representation for quantum $6j$-symbols, the shadow world. We obtain formulae for $q3j$-symbols and $q6j$-symbols for Verma modules and study their properties. This hints at the structure of the possible target category for Reshetikhin-Turaev functor for such an invariant.</description>
