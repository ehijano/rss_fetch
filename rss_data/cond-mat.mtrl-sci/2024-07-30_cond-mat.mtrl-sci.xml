      <title>A phase field model for deformation-induced amorphization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphization by severe plastic deformation has been observed in various crystalline materials. However, developing a quantitative and comprehensive theory for strain-induced amorphization remains challenging due to the complex nature of microstructural evolutions and deformation mechanisms. We propose a phase field model coupled with elastic-plastic theory to study the strain-induced amorphization in nanocrystalline materials. The plastic behaviors of crystalline phases and amorphous phases are coupled with phase evolutions by finite strain theory through the strain energy. This coupled model enables to quantitatively explore the effects of various defects on formation of amorphous phases such as shear bands. Simulations using our model predict that amorphous nucleation follows the martensitic transformation, and occurs primarily within localized regions of high stress, including shear bands. Our results also indicate an increase in the critical plastic strain for amorphization as the grain size increases. These findings align well with experimental results, validating the proposed model in capturing key features of deformation-induced amorphization. Our work provides valuable insights into deformation-induced amorphization and serves as a basis for developing more quantitative models with complex microscopic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh pyroelectricity in monoelemental 2D tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an ultrahigh pyroelectric response in van der Waals bonded layers of two-dimensional (2D) tellurium (Te) nanosheets (thickness, d = 4 to 5 nm) at periodic on-off temperature oscillations. For the first time a large pyroelectric coefficient, Pc ~ 3 mC.m-2.K-1, is observed which is eightfold higher than the traditional state-of-the-art pyroelectrics (lead zirconate titanate, PZT). The first-principles calculations point out that the breakdown of centro-symmetry in the 1-3 Te-layers (P-3m1 space group) of a non-centrosymmetry (higher-order symmetry of C2 space group) on an angular twist in the Te-Te bonds of an exotic electronic state in 2D Te. The angular Te-Te twisting elicits a surface-enhanced Raman band at 101 cm-1 (absent in bulk Te). The stimulation of the Born effective charge, in-plane piezoelectricity and thermal expansion coefficient are shown to tailor the large pyroelectricity. Thus, 2D Te nanosheets present a new paradigm for the wide application of pyroelectric materials for developing thermal energy-based flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Skyrmions in Magnetic Multilayer Thin Films are Half-Integer Hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin textures which have attracted intense research for their fundamentally novel physics and potential applications as spintronic information carriers. The stability which makes them so potentially useful is a result of their underlying non-trivial topology. While skyrmions were originally predicted and observed in crystalline materials lacking inversion symmetry, some of the most promising host systems for skyrmions are multilayer thin films, where skyrmions have been stabilized at ambient conditions, which is critical for their use in real world devices. The skyrmions found in multilayer thin films have additional three-dimensional structure, with their domain wall helicities twisting through the thickness of the film to create a hybrid skyrmion composed of a Bloch-type core with N\'eel-type caps of opposite chiralities at the surfaces. In this work, we show that this three-dimensional variation creates additional knotted topological structure, providing an explanation for their exceptional stability in ambient conditions. We show that hybrid skyrmions can be described as half-integer Hopfions, and that their field lines have the knotted structure of the Hopf fibration. Furthermore, we show that the topological charge of partially twisted hybrid skyrmions can be related to the domain wall helicity at the surfaces, providing a straightforward way to connect experimental measurements to underlying topology.</description>

      <title>ReactCA: A Cellular Automaton for Predicting Phase Evolution in Solid-State Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New computational tools for solid-state synthesis recipe design are needed in order to accelerate the experimental realization of novel functional materials proposed by high-throughput materials discovery workflows. This work contributes a cellular automaton simulation framework (ReactCA) for predicting the time-dependent evolution of intermediate and product phases during solid-state reactions as a function of precursor choice and amount, reaction atmosphere, and heating profile. The simulation captures rudimentary kinetic effects, the effects of reactant particle spatial distribution, particle melting and reaction atmosphere. It achieves conservation of mass using a stochastic, asynchronous evolution rule and estimates reaction rates using density functional theory data from the Materials Project [1] and machine learning estimators for the the melting point [2] and the vibrational entropy component of the Gibbs free energy [3]. The resulting simulation framework allows for the prediction of the likely outcome of a reaction recipe before any experiments are performed. We analyze five experimental solid-state recipes for BaTiO$_3$, CaZrN$_2$ and YMnO$_3$ found in the literature to illustrate the performance of the model in capturing reaction pathways as a function of temperature, reaction selectivity and the effect of precursor choice. Our approach allows for straightforward comparison of predicted mass fractions of intermediates and products with experimental results. This simulation framework presents a step toward $\textit{in silico}$ synthesis recipe design and an easier way to optimize existing recipes, aid in the identification of intermediates and identify effective recipes for yet unrealized inorganic solids.</description>

      <title>Planar structured materials with extreme elastic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing anisotropic structured materials by reducing symmetry results in unique behaviors, such as shearing under uniaxial compression or tension. This direction-dependent coupled mechanical phenomenon is crucial for applications such as energy redirection. While rank-deficient materials such as hierarchical laminates have been shown to exhibit extreme elastic anisotropy, there is limited knowledge about the fully anisotropic elasticity tensors achievable with single-scale fabrication techniques. No established upper and lower bounds on anisotropic moduli achieving extreme elastic anisotropy exist, similar to Hashin-Shtrikman bounds in isotropic composites. In this paper, we estimate the range of anisotropic stiffness tensors achieved by single-scale two-dimensional structured materials. To achieve this, we first develop a database of periodic anisotropic single-scale unit cell geometries using linear combinations of periodic cosine functions. The database covers a wide range of anisotropic elasticity tensors, which are then compared with the elasticity tensors of hierarchical laminates. Through this comparison, we identify the regions in the property space where hierarchical design is necessary to achieve extremal properties. We demonstrate a method to construct various 2D functionally graded structures using this cosine function representation for the unit cells. These graded structures seamlessly interpolate between unit cells with distinct patterns, allowing for independent control of several functional gradients, such as porosity, anisotropic moduli, and symmetry. The graded structures exhibit unique mechanical behaviors when designed with unit cells positioned at extreme parts of the property space. Specific graded designs are numerically studied to observe behaviors such as selective strain energy localization, compressive strains under tension, and localized rotations.</description>

      <title>Role of Domain Walls on Imprint and Fatigue in HfO2-Based Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HfO2-based ferroelectric materials are promising for the next generation of memory devices, attracting significant attention. However, their potential applications are significantly limited by fatigue and imprint phenomena, which affect device lifetime and memory capabilities. Here, to accurately describe the dynamics and field effects of HfO2, we adopt our newly developed DREAM-Allegro network scheme and develop a comprehensive machine-learning model for HfO2. Such model can not only predict the interatomic potential, but also predict Born effective charges. Applying such model, we explore the role of domain dynamics in HfO2 and find that the fatigue and imprint phenomena are closely related to the so-called E-path and T-path switching pathways. Based on the different atomic motions in the two paths, we propose that an inclined electric field can sufficiently suppress fatigue and enhancing the performance of HfO2-based ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling structure and interfacial interaction of monolayer TaSe2 on bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunability of interfacial effects between two-dimensional (2D) crystals is crucial not only for understanding the intrinsic properties of each system, but also for designing electronic devices based on ultra-thin heterostructures. A prerequisite of such heterostructure engineering is the availability of 2D crystals with different degrees of interfacial interactions. In this work, we report a controlled epitaxial growth of monolayer TaSe2 with different structural phases, 1H and 1T, on a bilayer graphene (BLG) substrate using molecular beam epitaxy, and its impact on the electronic properties of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. 1H-TaSe2 exhibits significant charge transfer and band hybridization at the interface, whereas 1T-TaSe2 shows weak interactions with the substrate. The distinct interfacial interactions are attributed to the dual effects from the differences of the work functions as well as the relative interlayer distance between TaSe2 films and BLG substrate. The method demonstrated here provides a viable route towards interface engineering in a variety of transition-metal dichalcogenides that can be applied to future nano-devices with designed electronic properties.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on spin density wave in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in high-pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ has garnered significant attention. Using density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at ambient pressure. Our calculations suggest that with $\delta=0$, the double spin stripe phase is favored as the magnetic ground state. Oxygen vacancies may effectively turn nearest Ni spins into charge sites. Consequently, with moderate $\delta$ values, our theoretical magnetic ground state exhibits characteristics of both double spin stripe and spin-charge stripe configurations, providing a natural explanation to reconcile the seemingly contradictory experimental findings that suggest both the configurations as candidates for the spin-density-wave phase. With higher $\delta$ values, we anticipate the ground state to become a spin-glass-like noncollinear magnetic phase with only short-range order. The oxygen vacancies are expected to significantly impact the magnetic excitations and the transition temperatures $T_{SDW}$. We further offer a plausible explanation for the experimental observations that the measured $T_{SDW}$ appears insensitive to the variation of samples and the lack of direct evidence for long-range magnetic ordering.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Tuning Thermoelectric Properties: Insights from Hybrid Functional Studies, Strain Engineering, and Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric properties in topological insulator Bi2Se3 are explored with multifaceted strategies, i.e., hybrid functional with strain and artificial intelligence methodology. The assessment with the experimental band gap values recognises the limitations of conventional functional and the effectiveness of screened hybrid functionals. A thorough investigation into the impact of biaxial and uniaxial strain on thermoelectric parameters uncovers distinctive behaviours in n-type and p-type Bi2Se3 , providing insights into optimal strain conditions for improved performance. Furthermore, the studies on the role of topologically non-trivial surface states (TNSS) in thermoelectric properties reveal that TNSS significantly dominate electronic transport. Dual scattering time approximation elucidates the segregation of thermoelectric transport contributions from bulk and surface states, highlighting the importance of controlling the relaxation time ratio for enhanced thermoelectric performance. Additionally, the prediction of thermoelectric properties using Random Forest and Neural Networks models showcase impressive agreement with density functional theory predictions across varying temperatures, offering a powerful tool for understanding complex temperature-dependent trends in thermoelectric properties. In summary, this interdisciplinary study presents a unique approach to advancing the understanding and optimization of thermoelectric properties in Bi2Se3 . It provides a comprehensive framework for tailoring material behaviour for diverse thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Microporosity of Crystalline Vanadomolybdate Frameworks for Selective Adsorptive Separation of Kr from Xe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective adsorptive capture and separation of chemically inert Kr and Xe noble gases with very low ppmv concentrations in air and industrial off-gases constitute an important technological challenge. Here, using a synergistic combination of experiment and theory, the microporous crystalline vanadomolybdates (MoVOx) as highly selective Kr sorbents are studied in detail. By varying the Mo/V ratios, we show for the first time that their one-dimensional pores can be fine-tuned for the size-selective adsorption of Kr over the larger Xe with selectivities reaching &gt;100. Using extensive electronic structure calculations and grand canonical Monte-Carlo simulations, the competition between Kr uptake with CO2 and N2 was also investigated. As most materials reported so far are selective toward the larger, more polarizable Xe than Kr, this work constitutes an important step toward robust Kr-selective sorbent materials. This work highlights the potential use of porous crystalline transition metal oxides as energy-efficient and selective noble gas capture sorbents for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Modified Dirac fermions in the crystalline xenon and graphene Moir\'{e} heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interface between two-dimensional (2D) crystals often forms a Moire superstructure that imposes a new periodicity, which is a key element in realizing complex electronic phases as evidenced in twisted bilayer graphene. A combined angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and first-principles calculations reveal the formation of a Moire superstructure between a 2D Dirac semi-metallic crystal, graphene, and a 2D insulating crystal of noble gas, xenon. Incommensurate diffraction pattern and folded Dirac cones around the Brillouin zone center imply the formation of hexagonal crystalline array of xenon atoms. The velocity of Dirac fermions increases upon the formation of the 2D xenon crystal on top of graphene due to the enhanced dielectric screening by the xenon over-layer. These findings not only provide a novel method to produce a Moire superstructure from the adsorption of noble gas on 2D materials, but also to control the physical properties of graphene by the formation of a graphene-noble gas interface.</description>

Abstract: We present magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) spectrometer based on a modified Martin-Puplett interferometer, utilizing continuous wave sub-THz low-power radiation in broad frequency range. This spectrometer is capable of measuring the frequency dependence of the MOKE response function, both the Kerr rotation and ellipticity, simultaneously with sub-milliradian accuracy without the need for reference measurement. The instrument's versatility allow it to be coupled to a cryostat with optical windows enabling studies of a variety of quantum materials such as unconventional superconductors, two-dimensional electron gas systems, quantum magnets, and other system showing optical Hall response, at sub-Kelvin temperatures and in high magnetic fields. We demonstrate the functionality of the MOKE spectrometer using an undoped InSb wafer as a test sample.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal to Monoclinic Phase Transition in Dense Hydrogen Phase III Detected by High-Pressure NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conclusive crystal structure determination of the high pressure phases of hydrogen remains elusive due to lack of core electrons and vanishing wave vectors, rendering standard high-pressure experimental methods moot. Ab-initio DFT calculations have shown that structural polymorphism might be solely resolvable using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at mega-bar pressures, however technical challenges have precluded such experiments thus far. Here, we present in-situ high-pressure high-resolution NMR experiments in hydrogen phase III between 181 GPa and 208 GPa at room temperature. Our spectra suggest that at lower pressures phase III adopts a hexagonal P6122 crystal structure, transitioning into a monoclinic C2/c phase at about 197 GPa. The high resolution spectra are in excellent agreement with earlier structural and spectral predictions and underline the possibility of a subtle P6122 to C2/c phase transition in hydrogen phase III. These experiments show the importance of a combination of ab-initio calculations and low-Z sensitive spectral probes in high-pressure science in elucidating the structural complexity of the most abundant element in our universe.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition in Quasi-One-Dimensional Bismuth Iodide Bi4I4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of topological quantum materials and topological phase transitions is at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics. Quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) bismuth iodide Bi4I4 exhibits versatile topological phases of matter including weak topological insulator (WTI) and higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) phases with high tunability in response to external parameters. In this work, performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicron spatial resolution (micro-ARPES), we comprehensively investigate the fine electronic structure and topological phase transition of Bi4I4. Our examination of the low-temperature {\alpha}-phase reveals the presence of an energy gap on the (100) surface, providing spectroscopic evidence for the HOTI phase. Conversely, the high-temperature {\beta}-Bi4I4 harbors a gapless Dirac fermion on the (100) surface alongside gapped states on the (001) surface, thereby establishing a WTI phase. By tracking the temperature evolution of the (100) surface states, we unveil a thermal hysteresis of the surface gap in line with the {\alpha}-{\beta} structural phase transition. Our findings elucidate the topological properties of Bi4I4 and directly evidence a temperature-induced topological phase transition from WTI to HOTI, which paves the way to potential applications based on the room-temperature topological phase transition in the quasi-1D topological quantum material.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium States and Interactions in the Topological Insulator and Topological Crystalline Insulator Phases of NaCd4As3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials are of great interest because they can support metallic states that are robust against perturbations, with the potential for technological applications. Here we experimentally explore the light-induced non-equilibrium properties of two distinct topological phases in NaCd4As3: a topological crystalline insulator (TCI) and a topological insulator (TI) phase. This material has surface states that are protected by mirror symmetry in the TCI phase at room temperature, while it undergoes a structural phase transition to a TI phase below 200 K. After exciting the TI phase by an ultrafast laser pulse, we observe a chemical potential shift &gt;150 meV, that slowly builds up and maximizes after ~0.6 ps, and that persists for ~8 ps. The slow rise time of the excited electron population and electron temperature suggests that the electronic and structural orders are strongly coupled in this TI phase. It also suggests that the excited electronic states immediately and ~0.6 ps after excitation belong to different orbitals, likely due to partial relaxation of the lattice distortion that is known to be associated with the TI phase. In contrast, no distinct excited state is observed in the TCI phase after photoexcitation, which we attribute to the low density of states and phase space available near the Fermi level. Our results show how ultrafast excitation can probe the excited states and interactions within phase rich topological materials.</description>

      <title>Molecular Orbital Electronic Instability in the van der Waals Kagome Semiconductor Nb$_3$Cl$_8$: Exploring Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a cluster Mott insulator with a distinctive magnetic molecular orbital structure organized into a breathing kagome lattice, showcases critical phase transitions under specialized conditions. By transitioning from paramagnetic to nonmagnetic states below 90 K, we clarified this behavior through combined nuclear magnetic resonance and low-temperature X-ray diffraction studies, pointing to charge disproportionation as the driving force. Subsequent investigations via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations have disclosed topologically flat bands, confirming advanced electronic characteristics in Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. These discoveries not only deepen our comprehension of Mott insulators but also broaden our grasp of the dynamic interrelations among topology, electron interactions, and quantum phenomena in two-dimensional systems. The research on Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ thus lays foundational knowledge for advancing the exploration of quantum states in complex material systems, marking it as a critical model in the ongoing evolution of condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models-Assisted Automated Labeling for Electron Microscopy Images Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning has facilitated the automated processing of electron microscopy (EM) big data stacks. However, designing a framework that eliminates manual labeling and adapts to domain gaps remains challenging. Current research remains entangled in the dilemma of pursuing complete automation while still requiring simulations or slight manual annotations. Here we demonstrate tandem generative adversarial network (tGAN), a fully label-free and simulation-free pipeline capable of generating EM images for computer vision training. The tGAN can assimilate key features from new data stacks, thus producing a tailored virtual dataset for the training of automated EM analysis tools. Using segmenting nanoparticles for analyzing size distribution of supported catalysts as the demonstration, our findings showcased that the recognition accuracy of tGAN even exceeds the manually-labeling method by 5%. It can also be adaptively deployed to various data domains without further manual manipulation, which is verified by transfer learning from HAADF-STEM to BF-TEM. This generalizability may enable it to extend its application to a broader range of imaging characterizations, liberating microscopists and materials scientists from tedious dataset annotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ab initio supported discovery of two new Pu based intermetallic compounds, PuNiSn and PuPtSn. Using density functional theory, the formation energies within the relevant ternary phase diagrams were calculated to predict the stability of both compounds. Simultaneously, Pu-Ni-Sn and Pu-Pt-Sn materials were arc-melted and subsequently characterized with magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity measurements from 2-300 K. Magnetization measurements show that PuNiSn and PuPtSn order antiferromagnetically at TN = 11 K and TN = 15 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements show an enhanced residual electronic specific heat that is indicative of strong electron correlations. Resistivity measurements are indicative of Kondo behavior for PuNiSn while crystal field effects may play a role in the observed temperature dependence for PuPtSn.</description>

      <title>MX precipitate behavior in an irradiated advanced Fe-9Cr steel: Helium effects on phase stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitates are main microstructural features to provide high temperature creep strength and radiation resistance in structural materials for fusion energy systems. However, the mechanisms of precipitate stability under irradiation in candidate structural materials for fusion first-wall and blanket components are poorly understood. In particular, the dual effects of helium transmutation and irradiation-induced damage on precipitate evolution have not been systematically studied in candidate materials, the leading of which are Fe-9Cr reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) alloys. To fill this knowledge gap, a fundamental understanding of the single and combined interactions of helium (0-25 appm He/dpa), temperature (300-600C), and atomic displacements (15-100 dpa) on the behavior of MX (M=metal, X=C and/or N) precipitates in an advanced Fe-9Cr RAFM alloy were studied through the use of dual ion irradiation experiments. It was found that helium suppressed the diffusion-mediated mechanisms of precipitate stability (i.e. radiation-enhanced growth) at elevated temperatures and intermediate damage levels but had no effect on precipitate dissolution in the high dose conditions (&gt;50 dpa). A precipitate stability model was used to rationalize the impacts of helium on ballistic dissolution and radiation-enhanced diffusion which are key contributors to overall precipitate stability. This is the second paper in a series of three to provide a systematic evaluation of MX precipitate behavior in RAFM steels under various fusion-relevant ion irradiation conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have characterised the submonolayer assembly of C60F48 molecular surface acceptors on the hydrogen terminated (100) diamond surface using scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and explored the influence this assembly has on the energy level alignment which governs surface transfer doping. Following deposition, disordered multilayered islands are observed. Annealing to 90$^{\circ} \rm{C}$ causes a transition from dewetting multi-layered islands to a single wetting layer at sufficiently high coverage, accompanied by a change in the energy alignment between the C60F48 and the diamond surface which consequently decreased the carrier density induced by transfer doping by 20%.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of Ta in the phase transition of Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 using low-temperature Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase engineering strategies in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Various methods, including direct synthesis, pressure control, and chemical doping, have been employed to manipulate structural transitions in 2D-TMDs. Metal intercalation emerges as an effective technique to modulate phase transition dynamics by inserting external atoms or ions between the layers of 2D-TMDs, altering their electronic structure and physical properties. Here, we investigate the significant structural phase transitions in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 single crystals induced by Ta intercalation using a combination of Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The results highlight the pivotal role of Ta atoms in driving these transitions and elucidate the interplay between intercalation, phase transitions, and resulting electronic and vibrational properties in 2D-TMDs. By focusing on Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 as an ideal case study and investigating like metal intercalation, this study advances understanding in the field and paves the way for the development of novel applications for 2D-TMDs, offering insights into the potential of these materials for future technological advancements.</description>

      <title>A multiplicative finite strain formulation for void growth models using elastic correctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed work is a formulation for large-strain non-isochoric plastic deformation, using the GTN yield function as the void growth rule as an example. This formulation is fully hyperelastic and uses the Kroner-Lee multiplicative decomposition. It adopts the concept of elastic correctors, and thus, does not have any constraints on the amount of elastic strain or the form of elasto-plastic behaviours. In addition, the volumetric part of the plastic deformation is described with the corrector of the volumetric part of the elastic logarithmic strain. It offers a new and sound kinematic approach to deal with non-isochoric plasticity. We also use the GTN function as an example to demonstrate the use of the kinematic relation as well as the implementation of the implicit algorithm.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin currents in bulk noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic spin currents are encountered in noncentrosymmetric crystals without any external electric fields; these currents are caused by spin-orbit interaction. In this paper, various theoretical aspects of this phenomenon in bulk ferromagnets are studied by using group theory, perturbation expansion, and calculations for model and real systems. The group-theoretical analysis of the spin-current tensor shows that the absence of space-inversion symmetry is not a sufficient condition for appearance of the intrinsic spin currents. The perturbation expansion proves that in the regime of exchange splitting dominating over spin-orbit interaction, the spin polarization of the intrinsic currents is nearly perpendicular to the direction of magnetization. First-principles calculations are carried out for NiMnSb and CoMnFeSi ferromagnetic compounds, both featured by a tetrahedral crystallographic point group. The dependence of the spin-current tensor on the direction of magnetization is approximated by a simple quadratic formula containing two constants; the relative error of this approximation is found as small as a few percent for both compounds.</description>

      <title>Elastic amplification from negative capacitance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics under suitable electric boundary conditions can present a negative capacitance response, whereby the total voltage drop across the ferroelectric opposes the externally applied bias. When the ferroelectric is in a heterostructure, this behavior yields a voltage amplification in the other elements, an effect that could be leveraged in low-power electronic devices. Interestingly, the mentioned voltage amplification should have an accompanying elastic effect. Specifically, in the typical case that the materials in contact with the ferroelectric are non-polar dielectrics, those should present an enhanced electrostrictive response. Here we use atomistic simulations - of model PbTiO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices displaying negative capacitance - to show that this is indeed the case: we reveal the enhanced elastic response of the dielectric layer and show that it is clearly linked to the voltage amplification. We argue that this "elastic amplification" could serve as a convenient experimental fingerprint for negative capacitance. Further, we propose that it may have interest on its own, e.g. for the development of low-power electromechanical actuators.</description>

      <title>Successive ferroelectric orders and magnetoelectric coupling without long-range magnetic order in highly frustrated pyrochlore compounds: Sm$_2$Ti$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sm$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, a member of rare-earth titanate pyrochlores, exhibits dipolar-octupolar antiferromagnetism below $T_N$ = 0.35 K. We observed two ferroelectric transitions at 182 ($T_{FE1}$) and 52 K ($T_{FE2}$), significantly higher than $T_N$ for Sm$_2$Ti$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_7$ ($x$ = 0, 0.1). Although the ferroelectric transition temperatures remain unchanged, the polarization value decreases considerably with V doping. A structural transition to a polar $R3m$ rhombohedral phase from the cubic $Fd\bar{3}m$ structure occurs at $T_{FE1}$, involving a distortion in the pyochlore lattice. Remarkably, significant linear magnetoelectric coupling is observed in both compounds, with further enhancement of magnetoelectric coupling due to magnetic V doping. The existence of magnetoelectric coupling without long-range magnetic order in a frustrated pyrochlore system could enable the tailoring of magnetoelectric coupling properties, which can be further fine-tuned through V doping. The emergence of ferroelectricity in a frustrated magnetic system introduces an intriguing aspect to these compounds and paves the way for developing ferroelectric order driven by the alleviation of magnetic frustration in pyrochlore systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing heat transport in MoS2 via defect-engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MoS2 is one of the most investigated and promising transition-metal dichalcogenides. Its popularity stems from the interesting properties of the monolayer phase, which can serve as the fundamental block for numerous applications. In this paper, we propose an atomistic perspective on the modulation of thermal transport properties in monolayer MoS2 through strategic defect engineering, specifically the introduction of sulfur vacancies. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations, we show how various distributions of sulfur vacancies -- ranging from random to periodically arranged configurations -- affect its thermal conductivity. Notably, we observe that certain periodic arrangements restore the thermal conductivity of the pristine system, due to a minimized interaction between acoustic and optical phonons facilitated by the imposed superperiodicity. This research deepens the understanding of phononic heat transport in two-dimensional materials and introduces a different point-of-view for phonon engineering in nanoscale devices, offering a pathway to enhance device performance and longevity through tailored thermal management strategies.</description>

      <title>LibRPA: A Software Package for Low-scaling First-principles Calculations of Random Phase Approximation Electron Correlation Energy Based on Numerical Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LibRPA is a software package designed for efficient calculations of random phase approximation (RPA) electron correlation energies from first principles using numerical atomic orbital (NAOs). Leveraging a localized resolution of identity (LRI) technique, LibRPA achieves $O(N^2)$ or better scaling behavior, making it suitable for large-scale calculation of periodic systems. Implemented in C++ and Python with MPI/OpenMP parallelism, LibRPA integrates seamlessly with NAO-based density functional theory (DFT) packages through flexible file-based and API-based interfaces. In this work, we present the theoretical framework, algorithm, software architecture, and installation and usage guide of LibRPA. Performance benchmarks, including the parallel efficiency with respect to the computational resources and the adsorption energy calculations for H$_2$O molecules on graphene, demonstrate its nearly ideal scalability and numerical reliability. LibRPA offers a useful tool for RPA-based calculations for large-scale extended systems.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of Temperature Measurement on TEM samples using Plasmon Energy Expansion Thermometry (PEET): Addressing Sample Thickness Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based microheaters have enabled in-situ materials characterization at the nanometer scale at elevated temperature. In addition to resolving the structural information at elevated temperatures, detailed knowledge of the local temperature distribution inside the sample is essential to reveal thermally induced phenomena and processes. Here, we investigate the accuracy of plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) as a method to map the local temperature in a tungsten (W) lamella in a range between room temperature and 700 degC. In particular, we address the influence of sample thickness in the range of a typical electron-transparent TEM sample (from 30 nm to 70 nm) on the temperature-dependent plasmon energy. The shift in plasmon energy, used to determine the local sample temperature, is not only temperature-dependent, but in case of W also thickness-dependent in sample thicknesses below approximately 60 nm. The results highlight the importance of considering sample thickness (and especially thickness variations) when analyzing the local bulk plasmon energy for temperature measurement using PEET. However, in case of W, an increasing beam broadening (FWHM) of the bulk plasmon peak with decreasing sample thickness can be used to improve the accuracy of PEET in TEM lamellae with varying sample thickness.</description>

      <title>Imprinting spin patterns by local strain control in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals magnets provide opportunities for exploring low-dimensional magnetism and spintronic phenomena. The Mermin-Wagner theorem states that long-range correlations in reduced dimensions are stabilized and controlled by magnetic anisotropy. In this study, we meticulously create and control the in-plane easy-axis magnetic anisotropy within two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPSe3 via a novel method involving topography and therefore strain control by using a micro-patterned substrate. By transposing the MnPSe3 thin flakes onto a substrate patterned with micro-scale grooves, we introduce local uniaxial strain pattern, which not only locks the spin direction to the strain direction but also replicates the groove pattern in the spin orientation distribution. Our approach generates spin orientations that correspond to the substrate patterns, therefore having the potential to significantly advance spintronic devices by offering a unique method for manipulating and designing spin textures in easy-plane magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The meeting of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing is already a reality; quantum machine learning (QML) promises the design of better regression models. In this work, we extend our previous studies of materials discovery using classical active learning (AL), which showed remarkable economy of data, to explore the use of quantum algorithms within the AL framework (QAL) as implemented in the MLChem4D and QMLMaterials codes. The proposed QAL uses quantum support vector regressor (QSVR) or a quantum Gaussian process regressor (QGPR) with various quantum kernels and different feature maps. Data sets include perovskite properties (piezoelectric coefficient, band gap, energy storage) and the structure optimization of a doped nanoparticle (3Al@Si11) chosen to compare with classical AL results. Our results revealed that the QAL method improved the searches in most cases, but not all, seemingly correlated with the roughness of the data. QAL has the potential of finding optimum solutions, within chemical space, in materials science and elsewhere in chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Reactions in solution require "contact" between the reagents. We can predict the rate at which reagents come into "contact" (at least in dilute conditions), but if the initial collision does not lead to reaction, what happens then? The collision rates in solution-phase reactions are generally described (explicitly or implicitly) with the Smoluchowski equation. Unfortunately, that model describes coagulations in gases, not reactions in solutions. The model is memory-less, i.e., collisions are treated as random processes, unaware of each other in space and time. The reality is that unreactive collisions create memory: particles (even molecules) "remember" they just collided, i.e, the probability of collision depends on how far back in time their prior collision happened. As we show here, this purely geometric and statistical fact is valid as long as their size is larger than the Kuhn length of their Brownian motion in solution. Under these conditions, particles in solution form, even in the absence of attractive interactions, relatively long-lived "clusters" kept together by the statistical unlikeliness of separating. We show here through Brownian dynamics simulations that, as a result of this memory, the collision rates and the lifetimes of these clusters, differently from what predicted by Smoluchowski's model, are proportional to the ratio between the radius of the colliders and the Kuhn length of their path in solution, with a coefficient close to unity!</description>

      <title>Near-Isotropic Sub-{\AA}ngstrom 3D Resolution Phase Contrast Imaging Achieved by End-to-End Ptychographic Electron Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional atomic resolution imaging using transmission electron microscopes is a unique capability that requires challenging experiments. Linear electron tomography methods are limited by the missing wedge effect, requiring a high tilt range. Multislice ptychography can achieve deep sub-{\AA}ngstrom resolution in the transverse direction, but the depth resolution is limited to 2 to 3 nanometers. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an end-to-end approach to reconstructing the electrostatic potential volume of the sample directly from the 4D-STEM datasets. End-to-end multi-slice ptychographic tomography recovers several slices at each tomography tilt angle and compensates for the missing wedge effect. The algorithm is initially tested in simulation with a Pt@$\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ core-shell nanoparticle, where both heavy and light atoms are recovered in 3D from an unaligned 4D-STEM tilt series with a restricted tilt range of 90 degrees. We also demonstrate the algorithm experimentally, recovering a Te nanoparticle with sub-{\AA}ngstrom resolution.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on broadband absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question of the optimal broadband absorption of waves in an open, dissipative system. We develop a general framework for absorption induced by multiple overlapping resonances, based on quasi-normal modes and radiative and non-radiative decay rates. Upper bounds on broadband absorption in a slab of thickness $d$ take the simple form: $A= 1-\exp(-F \alpha d)$, where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient and $F$ the path enhancement factor. We apply these results to sunlight absorption in photovoltaics and answer the long-standing debate on the best light-trapping strategy in solar cells. For angle-independent absorption, we derive the isotropic scattering upper bound $F = 4 n^2$ ($n$ the refractive index), extending the well-know Yablonovitch limit beyond the ray optics and weak absorption regimes. For angle-restricted illumination, we show that $F$ can be further increased up to $8 \pi n^2 / \sqrt{3}$ using multi-resonant absorption induced by periodical patterning. These results have a general scope in the field of wave physics and open new opportunities to maximize absorption, detection, and attenuation of electromagnetic or mechanical waves in ultrathin devices.</description>

      <title>Attosecond transient grating spectroscopy with near-infrared grating pulses and an extreme ultraviolet diffracted probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient grating spectroscopy has become a mainstay among metal and semiconductor characterization techniques. Here we extend the technique towards the shortest achievable timescales by using tabletop high-harmonic generation of attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses that diffract from transient gratings generated with 500-1000 nm sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) pulses. We demonstrate the power of attosecond transient grating spectroscopy (ATGS) by investigating the ultrafast photoexcited dynamics in an Sb semimetal thin film. ATGS provides an element-specific, background-free signal, unfettered by spectral congestion, in contrast to transient absorption spectroscopy. With the ATGS measurements in Sb polycrystalline thin films, we observe the generation of coherent phonons and investigate the lattice and carrier dynamics. Among the latter processes, we extract carrier thermalization, hot carrier cooling, and electron-hole recombination, which are on the order of 20 fs, 50 fs, and 2 ps, timescales, respectively. Furthermore, simultaneous collection of transient absorption and transient grating data allows us to extract the total complex dielectric constant in the sample dynamics, including the real-valued refractive index, from which we are also able to investigate carrier-phonon interactions and longer-lived phonon dynamics. The outlined experimental technique expands the capabilities of transient grating spectroscopy and attosecond spectroscopies by providing a wealth of information concerning carrier and lattice dynamics with an element-selective technique, at the shortest achievable timescales.</description>

      <title>Collective optical properties of moir\'e excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU RI-HF Energies and Analytic Gradients -- Towards High Throughput \textit{Ab Initio} Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an optimized algorithm and implementation for calculating resolution-of-the-identity Hartree-Fock (RI-HF) energies and analytic gradients using multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is especially designed for high throughput \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations of small and medium size molecules (10-100 atoms). Key innovations of this work include the exploitation of multi-GPU parallelism and a workload balancing scheme that efficiently distributes computational tasks among GPUs. Our implementation also employs techniques for symmetry utilization, integral screening and leveraging sparsity to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Computational results show that the implementation achieves significant performance improvements, including over $3\times$ speedups in single GPU AIMD throughput compared to previous GPU-accelerated RI-HF and traditional HF methods. Furthermore, utilizing multiple GPUs can provide super-linear speedup when the additional aggregate GPU memory allows for the storage of decompressed three-center integrals. Additionally, we report strong scaling efficiencies for systems up to 1000 basis functions and demonstrate practical applications through extensive performance benchmarks on up to quadruple-$\zeta$ primary basis sets, achieving floating-point performance of up to 47\% of the theoretical peak on a 4$\times$A100 GPU node.</description>

      <title>Domain-Wall Ferroelectric Polarons in a two-dimensional Rotor Lattice Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of ferroelectric domain-wall polarons in a minimal two-dimensional lattice model of electrons interacting with rotating dipoles. Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions, causing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The rotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability in the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking process. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric polarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Gapped quantum spin liquid in a triangular-lattice Ising-type antiferromagnet PrMgAl11O19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search of quantum spin liquid (QSLs), spin-1/2 triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets (TLHAFs) have always been viewed as fertile soils. Despite the true magnetically-ordered ground state, anisotropy has been considered to play a significant role in stabilizing a QSL state. However, the nature and ground state of the most anisotropic case, the triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet (TLIAF), remains elusive and controversial. Here, we report specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements on a newly-discovered Ising-type QSL candidate PrMgAl11O19. At zero field, the magnetic specific heat shows a quadratic temperature dependence. On the contrary, no direct positive magnetic contribution to thermal conductivity was detected, ruling out the presence of mobile gapless fermionic excitations. Further analysis of phonon thermal conductivity reveals that the phonons are strongly scattered by thermally-activated magnetic excitations out of a gap, which exhibits a linear dependence with magnetic field. These results demonstrate that the spin-1/2 TLIAF PrMgAl11O19 has a gapped Z2 QSL ground state.</description>

Abstract: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is trained to reproduce the evolution of the spinodal decomposition process in three dimensions as described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A specialized, physics-inspired architecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted evolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration schemes. The method can closely reproduce the evolution of microstructures not represented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs. Extremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the theoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, despite the training set containing only relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution. Quantitative accordance with the decay rate of the Free energy is also demonstrated up to late coarsening stages, providing an example of a data-driven, physically consistent and high-accuracy Machine Learning method for the long timescale simulation of materials.</description>

      <title>Fermi-surface diagnosis for $s$-wave-like topological superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical prediction of topological superconductivity is key to their discovery. Recently, it is proved that in 199 out of 230 space groups, topological superconductivity coexists with an $s$-wave-like pairing symmetry, raising the hope of finding more candidates for this exotic phase. However, a comprehensive and efficient method for diagnosing topological superconductivity in realistic materials remains elusive. Here, we derive Fermi-surface formulas for gapped and gapless topological phases of time-reversal symmetric superconductors with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries in all layer and space groups, applicable to thin-film and bulk materials. Our diagnosis uses only the sign of the pairing and the Fermi velocity at several Fermi points, and yields complete (partial) diagnosis for gapped topological superconductivity in 159 (40) out of the 199 space groups. This provides a fundamental basis for the first-principles prediction of new topological superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically reexamine nearly uniform electron models with weak crystalline potentials. In particular, we theorize the modulation of the plane-wave branches at linear regions where multiple Bragg planes intersect. Any such linear intersections involve three or more plane-wave branches diffracted by the periodic potential. Small inter-branch interactions can yield various crossing and anticrossing singularities with promised breakdown of the quadratic approximation, extending alongside the intersection lines. Most of the intersections run in low-symmetric paths in the Brillouin zone and therefore we cannot completely characterize their electronic states with standard band structure plotting methods. The present theory reveals a general mechanism in nearly uniform systems to induce the Dirac nodal lines and van-Hove singularities with broken quadratic band approximation in three dimensions, which may host a variety of anomalous low-energy electronic properties. We apply the theory to a recently discovered high temperature superconductor H$_{3}$S to interpret the enigmatic density-of-state (DOS) peaking therein. The results show how and {\it why there} the continuous saddle points--the source of the peaked DOS--emerge, as well as reveal the companion Dirac nodal lines hidden in the conduction bands.</description>

      <title>Accounting for localized deformation: a simple computation of true stress in micropillar compression experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compression experiments are widely used to study the mechanical properties of materials at micro- and nanoscale. However, the conventional engineering stress measurement method used in these experiments neglects to account for the alterations in the material's shape during loading. This can lead to inaccurate stress values and potentially misleading conclusions about the material's mechanical behavior especially in the case of localized deformation. To address this issue, we present a method for calculating true stress in cases of localized plastic deformation commonly encountered in experimental settings: (i) a single band and (ii) two bands oriented in arbitrary directions with respect to the vertical axis of the pillar (either in the same or opposite directions). Our simple analytic formulas can be applied to homogeneous and isotropic materials and crystals, requiring only standard data (displacement-force curve, aspect ratio, shear band angle and elastic strain limit) obtained from experimental results and eliminating the need for finite element computations. Our approach provides a more precise interpretation of experimental results and can serve as a valuable and simple tool in material design and characterization.</description>

      <title>Polarization evolution equation for the exchange-strictionally formed II-type multiferroic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiferroics are the materials, where single cell of a magnetically order crystal forms an electric dipole moment. We derive equation for the evolution of the macroscopic density of the electric dipole moment (polarization of the system). The derivation is made within the "quantum hydrodynamic" method, which allows to derive equations for the evolution of the macroscopic functions of the quantum systems starting with the microscopic description. In this work we do not consider the microscopic level of individual electrons and ions, but we start our analysis from the combination of ions in cells of the crystal. We present an effective Hamiltonian for the evolution of such intermediate scale objects. We also apply the equation for the electric dipole moment of the single cell, which is recontracted in the corresponding operator. Using this operator and the wave function of combination of ions in the cell, we define the macroscopic density of the electric dipole moment. Finally, we apply the nonstationary Schrodinger equation with the chosen Hamiltonian in order to derive equation evolution of the polarization. The derivation is made for the dipole formed by the exchange-striction mechanism in the II-type multiferroic materials. The interaction caused term in the polarization evolution equation is found to be proportional to the fourth space derivative of mixed product (triple scalar product) of three spin density vectors. Conditions are discussed for the regime, where interaction appears in a smaller order on the space derivatives.</description>

Abstract: A static peridynamic (proposed by Silling, see J. Mech. Phys. Solids 2000; 48:175--209) composite materials (CMs) of the random and periodic structures are considered. In the framework of the second background of micromechanics (also called computational analytical micromechanics, CAM), one proved that local micromechanics (LM) and peridynamic micromechanics (PM) are formally similar to each other for CM of both random and periodic structures. It allows straightforward generalization of LM methods to their PM counterparts. It turns out that a plurality of micromechanics phenomena [e.g. statistically homogeneous and inhomogeneous media, inhomogeneous loading (inhomogeneous body force is included), nonlinear and nonlocal constitutive laws of phases, and coupled physical phenomena] can be analyzed by one universal tool (called CAM), which is sufficiently flexible and based on physically clear hypotheses that can be modified and improved if necessary (up to abandonment of these hypotheses) in the framework of a unique scheme for analyses of a wide class of mentioned problems. The schemes of these approaches are considered in the current paper.</description>

Abstract: In-situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) provides sub-Angstrom spatiotemporal information on nanoscale chemical transformations. However, the high-energy electron probe can significantly affect the surrounding medium's chemistry and induce side reactions within the area of interest. Radiolysis, or the dissociation of molecules under electron beam irradiation, has become an increasingly important consideration in in-situ nanomaterials characterization. While numerous studies have explored this phenomenon in liquid-cell TEM, there are no reported extensions to gas phase TEM thus far. Herein, we present a generalized computational model to elucidate radiation chemistry in both gas and liquid E-TEM. Our model reveals that gas phase E-TEM produces radiolytic species with lower reactivity than in the liquid phase. However, these radiolysis species can accumulate to levels that interfere with desired reactions, especially at higher pressures. We verify our model by studying the radiation-promoted oxidation of aluminum nanocubes and the disproportionation of carbon monoxide, where we find increasing the electron beam dose rate increases the rate of AlOx production and deposited carbon, respectively. Additionally, we propose guidelines to control the production of radiolysis species within these closed-cell in-situ nanoreactors. Taken together, these findings should pave the way for nanoscale control of chemical reactions in E-TEM.</description>

Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient and reliable method that enables initialization and readout of spin states through spin-photon interface. In general, high quantum efficiency and large spin-dependent photoluminescence contrast are desirable for reliable quantum information readout. However, reliable prediction of the ODMR contrast from first-principles requires accurate description of complex spin polarization mechanisms of spin defects. These mechanisms often include multiple radiative and nonradiative processes in particular intersystem crossing (ISC)among multiple excited electronic states. In this work we present our implementation of the first-principles ODMR contrast, by solving kinetic master equation with calculated rates from \textit{ab initio} electronic structure methods then benchmark the implementation on the case of the negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We show the importance of correct description of multi-reference electronic states and pseudo Jahn-Teller effect for quantitatively, even qualitatively correct prediction of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the rate of ISC. We present the complete calculation of SOC for different ISC processes that align with both group theory and experimental observations. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive picture of excitation and relaxation dynamics, including previously unexplored internal conversion processes. We show good agreement between our first-principles calculations and the experimental ODMR contrast under magnetic field. We then demonstrate reliable predictions of magnetic field direction, pump power, and microwave frequency dependency, as important parameters for ODMR experiments. Our work provides a predictive computational platform for spin polarization and optical readout of solid-state quantum defects from first principles.</description>

      <title>A phonon-driven mechanism for an emergent and reversible chirality in crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate through first-principles calculations applied to the K$_{3}$NiO$_{2}$ crystal that a structural phase transition from an achiral to a chiral phase can be mediated by a degenerate soft phonon mode and controlled by pressure and epitaxial strain. Breaking such degeneracy with an electric field generates a competition between enantiomorphic, polar, and orthorhombic displacements. Originated by the interaction between spontaneous chiral and induced polar and axial modes, an optimal parameter window for converting the handedness of the system into its opposite kind is observed.</description>

      <title>A defect-chemistry-informed phase-field model of grain growth in oxide electroceramics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dopants can significantly affect the properties of oxide ceramics through their impact on the property-determined microstructure characteristics such as grain boundary segregation, space charge layer formation in the grain boundary vicinity, and the resultant microstructure features like bimodality due to abnormal grain growth. To support rational oxide ceramics design, we propose a multiphysics-based and defect-chemistry-informed phase-field grain growth model to simulate the microstructure evolution of oxide ceramics. It fully respects the thermodynamics of charged point defects (oxygen vacancies and dopants) in both the grain interior and boundaries and considers the competing kinetics of defect diffusion and grain boundary movement. The proposed phase-field model is benchmarked against well-known simplified bicrystal models, including the Mott-Schottky and Gouy-Chapman models. Various simulation results are presented to reveal the impacts of defect formation energy differences between the grain interior and the grain boundary core on the key microstructural aspects. In particular, simulation results confirm that the solute drag effect alone can lead to bimodal grain size distribution, without any contribution from grain misorientation and other anisotropy. Interestingly, abnormal grain growth simulations demonstrate that grain boundary potentials can vary substantially: grain boundaries of larger grains tend to have lower potentials than those of smaller grains. Such heterogeneous grain boundary potential distribution may inspire a new material optimization strategy through microstructure design. This study provides a comprehensive framework for defect-chemistry-consistent investigations of microstructure evolution in polycrystalline oxide ceramics, offering fundamental insights into in-situ processes during critical manufacturing stages.</description>

      <title>Implementing Reactivity in Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Harmonic Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.14418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of chemical reactions and mechanical properties including failure from atoms to the micrometer scale remains a longstanding challenge in chemistry and materials science. Bottlenecks include computational feasibility, reliability, and cost. We introduce a method for reactive molecular dynamics simulations using a clean replacement of non-reactive classical harmonic bond potentials with reactive, energy-conserving Morse potentials, called the Reactive INTERFACE Force Field (IFF-R). IFF-R is compatible with force fields for organic and inorganic compounds such as IFF, CHARMM, PCFF, OPLS-AA, and AMBER. Bond dissociation is enabled by three interpretable Morse parameters per bond type and zero energy upon disconnect. Use cases for bond breaking in molecules, failure of polymers, carbon nanostructures, proteins, composite materials, and metals are shown. The simulation of bond forming reactions was included via template-based methods. IFF-R maintains the accuracy of the corresponding non-reactive force fields and is about 30 times faster than prior reactive simulation methods.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Emergence and Growth Dynamics of Wetting-induced Phase Separation on Soft Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid droplets on soft solids, such as soft polymeric gels, can induce substantial surface deformations, leading to the formation of wetting ridges at contact points. While these contact ridges have been shown to govern the rich surface mechanics on compliant substrates, the inherently divergent characteristics of contact points and the multiphase nature of soft reticulated gels pose great challenges for continuum mechanical theories in modeling soft wetting phenomena. In this study, we report in-situ experimental characterizations of the emergence and growth dynamics of the wetting-induced phase separation. The measurements demonstrate how the migration of free chains prevents the stress singularities at contact points. Based on the Onsager variational principle, we present a phenomenological model that effectively captures the extraction process of free chains, including a crossover from a short-term diffusive state to a long-term equilibrium state. By comparing model predictions with experimental results for varied crosslinking densities, we reveal how the intrinsic material parameters of soft gels dictate phase separation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interaction between U-shaped amyloid beta fibril and semiconducting silicon nitride monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by some recent works showing the ability of semiconducting monolayers to disintegrate the structures of biological fibrils, we have applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in both classical and quantum regimes to investigate whether semiconducting Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has the same ability on interaction with U-shaped amyloid beta (A$\beta$) fibril. In agreement with the literature, we found that disintegration began from the last chain (E) due to the rather strong interaction between the monolayer and the fibril residues numbered from 17 to 28 on the very chain, also engaging the next chain (D) over time. As a result, the $\beta$-sheet-rich content of chain E considerably decreases on interaction with the monolayer, turning into other secondary-structure types including turn and coil, in accordance with experimental findings. Results endorse the view that semiconducting Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has the potential of destabilizing the structure and conformation of U-shaped amyloid beta fibrils.</description>

      <title>Quantum valley Hall states in low-buckled counterparts of graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With low-buckled structure for each layer in graphene bilayer system, there breaks inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) for one stacking when both A and B sublattices in top layer are aligned with those in bottom layer. In consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there opens nontrivial topological gap in each monolayer system to achieve quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE). As long as time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) is preserved the gapless edge states is robust in each individual layer even for the bilayer absent of PT symmetry. Based on this platform and through tight-binding (TB) model calculations we find it becomes a typical system that can exhibit quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) when introduced a layer-resolved Rashba SOC that leads to band inversion at each K valley in the hexagonal Brillion zone (BZ). The topological transition comes from that the valley Chern number Cv = CK - CK' switches from 0 to 2, which characterizes the nontrivial QVHE phase transited from two coupled Z2 topological insulators. We also point that the layer-resolved Rashba SOC can be introduced equivalently by twisting two van der Waals touched layers. And through TB calculations, it is shown that the K bands inverts in its corresponding mini BZ when the two layers twisted by a small angle. Our findings advance potential applications for the devices design in topological valleytronics and twistronics.</description>

      <title>True random number generation using 1T' molybdenum ditelluride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: True random numbers are essential for scientific research and various engineering problems. Their generation, however, depends on a reliable entropy source. Here, we present true random number generation using the conductance noise probed from structurally metastable 1T' MoTe2 prepared via electrochemical exfoliation. The noise, fitting a Poisson process, is a robust entropy source capable of remaining stable even at 15 K. Noise spectral density and statistical time-lag suggest the noise originates from the random polarization of the ferroelectric dipoles in 1T' MoTe2. Using a simple circuit, the noise allows true random number generation, enabling their use as the seed for high-throughput secure random number generation over 1 Mbit/s, appealing for applications such as cryptography where secure data protection has now become severe. Particularly, we demonstrate safeguarding key biometric information in neural networks using the random numbers, proving a critical data privacy measure in big data and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>AC conductivity and magnetic dichroism of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magneto-optical properties of two-dimensional nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals in the presence of antiferromagnetic order. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor of two-dimensional CuMnAs, a prototype antiferromagnetic Dirac material, as a function of light frequency. From the finite-frequency conductivity tensor, we derive the dynamic dielectric function and magnetic linear dichroism, demonstrating how they are influenced by the orientation of the N{\'e}el order parameter. Adjusting the N{\'e}el vector changes both the sign and amplitude of the system's magneto-optical response. We propose that magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy is a powerful technique for determining the orientation of the N{\'e}el vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have demonstrated that multi-phonon scattering processes substantially influence the thermal conductivity of materials, posing significant computational challenges for classical simulations as the complexity of phonon modes escalates. This study examines the potential of quantum simulations to address these challenges, utilizing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era (NISQ) quantum computational capabilities and quantum error mitigation techniques to optimize thermal conductivity calculations. Employing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we simulate phonon-phonon contributions based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). Our methodology involves mapping multi-phonon scattering systems to fermionic spin operators, necessitating the creation of a customized ansatz to balance circuit accuracy and depth. We construct the system within Fock space using bosonic operators and transform the Hamiltonian into the sum of Pauli operators suitable for quantum computation. By addressing the impact of depolarization and non-unitary noise effects, we benchmark the noise influence and implement error mitigation strategies to develop a more efficient model for quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>CASTRO -- Efficient constrained sampling method for material and chemical experimental design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of multicomponent material composition space requires significant time and financial investments, necessitating efficient use of resources for statistically relevant compositions. This article introduces a novel methodology, implemented in the open-source CASTRO (ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd) software package, to overcome equality-mixture constraints and ensure comprehensive design space coverage. Our approach leverages Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU) using a divide-and-conquer strategy to manage high-dimensional problems effectively. By incorporating previous experimental knowledge within a limited budget, our method strategically recommends a feasible number of experiments to explore the design space. We validate our methodology with two examples: a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional mixture constraints, yielding specific component distributions. Our constrained sequential LHS or LHSMDU approach enables thorough design space exploration, proving robustness for experimental design. This research not only advances material science but also offers promising solutions for efficiency challenges in pharmaceuticals and chemicals. CASTRO and the case studies are available for free download on GitHub.</description>
