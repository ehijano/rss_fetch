      <title>Music102: An $D_{12}$-equivariant transformer for chord progression accompaniment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Music102, an advanced model built upon the Music101 prototype, aimed at enhancing chord progression accompaniment through a D12-equivariant transformer. Inspired by group theory and symbolic music structures, Music102 leverages musical symmetry--such as transposition and reflection operations--integrating these properties into the transformer architecture. By encoding prior music knowledge, the model maintains equivariance across both melody and chord sequences. The POP909 dataset was employed to train and evaluate Music102, revealing significant improvements over Music101 in both weighted loss and exact accuracy metrics, despite using fewer parameters. This work showcases the adaptability of self-attention mechanisms and layer normalization to the discrete musical domain, addressing challenges in computational music analysis. With its stable and flexible neural framework, Music102 sets the stage for further exploration in equivariant music generation and computational composition tools, bridging mathematical theory with practical music performance.</description>

      <title>Unified Microphone Conversion: Many-to-Many Device Mapping via Feature-wise Linear Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce Unified Microphone Conversion, a unified generative framework to enhance the resilience of sound event classification systems against device variability. Building on the limitations of previous works, we condition the generator network with frequency response information to achieve many-to-many device mapping. This approach overcomes the inherent limitation of CycleGAN, requiring separate models for each device pair. Our framework leverages the strengths of CycleGAN for unpaired training to simulate device characteristics in audio recordings and significantly extends its scalability by integrating frequency response related information via Feature-wise Linear Modulation. The experiment results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 2.6% and reducing variability by 0.8% in macro-average F1 score.</description>

      <title>Human Action Recognition without Human</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.07876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to evaluate "human action recognition without human". Motion representation is frequently discussed in human action recognition. We have examined several sophisticated options, such as dense trajectories (DT) and the two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN). However, some features from the background could be too strong, as shown in some recent studies on human action recognition. Therefore, we considered whether a background sequence alone can classify human actions in current large-scale action datasets (e.g., UCF101). In this paper, we propose a novel concept for human action analysis that is named "human action recognition without human". An experiment clearly shows the effect of a background sequence for understanding an action label.</description>

      <title>Taming Data and Transformers for Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating ambient sounds is a challenging task due to data scarcity and often insufficient caption quality, making it difficult to employ large-scale generative models for the task. In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing two new models. First, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality and efficient automatic audio captioning model. By using a compact audio representation and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of 83.2, marking a 3.2% improvement from the best available captioning model at four times faster inference speed. Second, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. Using AutoCap to generate caption clips from existing audio datasets, we demonstrate the benefits of data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to state-of-the-art audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of 4.7% in FAD score, 22.7% in IS, and 13.5% in CLAP score, indicating significantly improved quality of generated audio compared to previous works. Moreover, we propose an efficient and scalable pipeline for collecting audio datasets, enabling us to compile 57M ambient audio clips, forming AutoReCap-XL, the largest available audio-text dataset, at 90 times the scale of existing ones. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</description>
