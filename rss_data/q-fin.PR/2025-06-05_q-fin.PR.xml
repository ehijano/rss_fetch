      <title>The Surprising Irrelevance of Total-Value-Locked on Cryptocurrency Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common assumption in cryptocurrency markets is a positive relationship between total-value-locked (TVL) and cryptocurrency returns. To test this hypothesis we examine whether the returns of TVL-sorted portfolios can be explained by common cryptocurrency factors. We find evidence that portfolios formed on TVL exhibit returns that are linear functions of aggregate crypto market returns, that is they can be replicated with appropriate weights on the crypto market portfolio. Thus, strategies based on TVL can be priced with standard asset pricing tools. This result holds true both for total TVL and a simple TVL measure that removes a number of ways TVL may be overstated.</description>

      <title>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</description>
