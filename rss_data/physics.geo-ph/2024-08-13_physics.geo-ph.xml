      <title>DCMSA: Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism Based on Deformable Convolution For Seismic Data Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dealing with seismic data, diffusion models often face challenges in adequately capturing local features and expressing spatial relationships. This limitation makes it difficult for diffusion models to remove noise from complex structures effectively. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel convolutional attention mechanism Multi-head Self-attention mechanism based on Deformable convolution (DCMSA) achieving efficient fusion of diffusion models with convolutional attention. The implementation of DCMSA is as follows: First, we integrate DCMSA into the UNet architecture to enhance the network's capability in recognizing and processing complex seismic data. Next, the diffusion model utilizes the UNet enhanced with DCMSA to process noisy data. The results indicate that this method addresses the shortcomings of diffusion models in capturing local features and expressing spatial relationships effectively, proving superior to traditional diffusion models and standard neural networks in noise suppression and preserving meaningful seismic data information.</description>

      <title>Approaches for enhancing extrapolability in process-based and data-driven models in hydrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of process-based and data-driven hydrological models is crucial in modern hydrological research, especially for predicting key water cycle variables such as runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture. These models provide a scientific basis for water resource management, flood forecasting, and ecological protection. Process-based models simulate the physical mechanisms of watershed hydrological processes, while data-driven models leverage large datasets and advanced machine learning algorithms. This paper reviewed and compared methods for assessing and enhancing the extrapolability of both model types, discussing their prospects and limitations. Key strategies include the use of leave-one-out cross-validation and similarity-based methods to evaluate model performance in ungauged regions. Deep learning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation techniques are also promising in their potential to improve model predictions in data-sparse and extreme conditions. Interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous algorithmic advancements are also important to strengthen the global applicability and reliability of hydrological models.</description>

      <title>Surface elevation errors in finite element Stokes models for glacier evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary data which determine the evolution of glaciation are the bedrock elevation and the surface mass balance. From this data, which we assume is defined over a fixed land region, the glacier's geometry solves a free-boundary problem which balances the surface velocity from the Stokes flow with the surface mass balance. A surface elevation function for this problem is admissible if it is above the bedrock topography, equivalently if the ice thickness is nonnegative. For an implicit time step, this free-boundary problem can be posed in weak form as a variational inequality. After some preparatory theory for the glaciological Stokes problem, we conjecture that the continuous-space, implicit time step problem for the surface elevation is well-posed. This conjecture is supported both by physical arguments and numerical evidence. We then prove a general theorem which bounds the error made by a finite element approximation of a nonlinear variational inequality in a Banach space. The bound is a sum of error terms of different types which are special to variational inequalities. In the case of the implicit-step glacier problem these terms are of three types: errors from discretizing the bed elevation, errors from numerically solving for the Stokes velocity, and finally an expected quasi-optimal finite element error in the surface elevation itself.</description>

      <title>A three-layer model for the dam-break flow of particulate suspensions driven by sedimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a system of Saint-Venant-type equations to model laboratory experiments of dam-break particle-laden flows. We explore homogeneous and non-cohesive liquid-solid suspensions of monodispersed glass beads that propagate as single-phase flows, forming a progressively growing deposit of particles at the bottom of a smooth channel and creating a thin layer of pure liquid at the surface. The novelty of this model is twofold. First, we fully characterize the first-order behavior of these flows (mean velocity, runout distances and deposits geometry) through the sole sedimentation process of the grains, thus avoiding the use of any artificial friction to stop the flow. The model remains very simple and turns out to be effective despite the complex nature of interactions involved in these phenomena. Secondly, the sedimentation dynamics of the grains is observed to not being mainly affected by the flow, but remains comparable to that measured in static suspensions. The mathematical model is validated by comparing the experimental kinematics and deposit profiles with the simulations. The results highlight that this simplified model is sufficient to describe the general features of these flows as well as their deposit morphology, provided that the settling rate is adjusted starting from a critical value of the Reynolds number where the flow agitation begins to significantly delay the mean sedimentation velocity.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties too large to predict tipping times of major Earth system components from historical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One way to warn of forthcoming critical transitions in Earth system components is using observations to detect declining system stability. It has also been suggested to extrapolate such stability changes into the future and predict tipping times. Here, we argue that the involved uncertainties are too high to robustly predict tipping times. We raise concerns regarding (i) the modeling assumptions underlying any extrapolation of historical results into the future, (ii) the representativeness of individual Earth system component time series, and (iii) the impact of uncertainties and preprocessing of used observational datasets, with focus on nonstationary observational coverage and gap filling. We explore these uncertainties in general and specifically for the example of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. We argue that even under the assumption that a given Earth system component has an approaching tipping point, the uncertainties are too large to reliably estimate tipping times by extrapolating historical information.</description>

      <title>The Physics-Informed Neural Network Gravity Model: Generation III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning and the advent of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) have shown high potential in their ability to solve complex differential equations. One example is the use of PINNs to solve the gravity field modeling problem -- learning convenient representations of the gravitational potential from position and acceleration data. These PINN gravity models, or PINN-GMs, have demonstrated advantages in model compactness, robustness to noise, and sample efficiency when compared to popular alternatives; however, further investigation has revealed various failure modes for these and other machine learning gravity models which this manuscript aims to address. Specifically, this paper introduces the third generation Physics-Informed Neural Network Gravity Model (PINN-GM-III) which includes design changes that solve the problems of feature divergence, bias towards low-altitude samples, numerical instability, and extrapolation error. Six evaluation metrics are proposed to expose these past pitfalls and illustrate the PINN-GM-III's robustness to them. This study concludes by evaluating the PINN-GM-III modeling accuracy on a heterogeneous density asteroid, and comparing its performance to other analytic and machine learning gravity models.</description>
