      <title>Automating Sensor Characterization with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Particle Identification in Helium-Based Drift Chambers Using Cluster Counting Insights from Beam Test Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle identification in gaseous detectors traditionally relies on energy loss measurements (dE/dx); however, uncertainties in total energy deposition limit its resolution. The cluster counting technique (dN/dx) offers an alternative approach by exploiting the Poisson-distributed nature of primary ionization, providing a statistically robust method for mass determination. Simulation studies with Garfield++ and Geant4 indicate that dN/dx can achieve twice the resolution of dE/dx in helium-based drift chambers. However, experimental implementation is challenging due to signal overlap in the time domain, complicating the identification of electron peaks and ionization clusters. This paper presents novel algorithms and modern computational techniques to address these challenges, facilitating accurate cluster recognition in experimental data. The effectiveness of these algorithms is validated through four beam tests conducted at CERN, utilizing various helium gas mixtures, gas gains, and wire orientations relative to ionizing tracks. The experiments employ a muon beam (1 GeV/c to 180 GeV/c) with drift tubes of different sizes and sense wire diameters. The analysis explores the Poisson nature of cluster formation, evaluates the performance of different clustering algorithms, and examines the dependence of counting efficiency on the beam particle impact parameter. Furthermore, a comparative study of the resolution achieved using dN/dx and dE/dx is presented.</description>

      <title>Background stability and annual modulation test using PICOLON ultra-pure NaI(Tl) detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter observation claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. NaI(Tl) crystals with radiopurity comparable to DAMA/LIBRA's are essential for adequate verification. Existing experiments using NaI(Tl) target have been hampered by the high radioactivity concentration of NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON experiment conducts an independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using highest purity NaI(Tl) crystals. In 2020, the NaI(Tl) crystal (Ingot#85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The DAMA/LIBRA group has stressed that verifying their signal requires high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals with long-term stability. Based on a six-month measurement, we have confirmed the long-term stability of its radiopurity. This stability provides a significant advantage for future efforts to adequately verify the DAMA/LIBRA result using NaI(Tl) crystal. In this paper, we present the background stability of purity in the Ingot#94 NaI(Tl) detector, which was produced using the Ingot#85 purification method, along with the first annual modulation search conducted by the PICOLON experiment.</description>

      <title>X-ray and neural network based in-situ identification of the melt pool during the additive manufacturing of a stainless steel part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser Metal Deposition with Powder (LMDp) is an additive manufacturing technique used for repairing metal components or producing parts with intricate geometries. However, a comprehensive understanding of the melt pool dynamics, which significantly influences the final properties of LMDp-fabricated parts, remains limited. Non-destructive testing is highly valuable for conducting in-situ controls during manufacturing. X-ray imaging offers the ability to penetrate metallic parts and detect defects such as porosity. In the context of additive manufacturing, X-rays can be employed to visualize the shape of the melt pool during the fabrication process. The contrast between the liquid and solid phases, due to their density differences, should be observable in the radioscopy images. The experimental setup required to perform such a test on an industrial additive manufacturing installation consists of a movable X-ray source that produces polychromatic beams, a detector, and extensive lead shielding to ensure X-ray safety. In-situ observations of the melt pool were conducted during the deposition of ten successive layers of stainless steel 316L (SS316L). The polychromatic nature of the X-ray beam, however, rendered traditional image analysis methods ineffective for detecting contrast variations. To address this challenge, neural networks trained on simulated data (thermal and X-ray) were employed, providing a solution to identify the melt pool in low-contrast radioscopic images. The architecture inspired by VGG16 demonstrated promising results, confirming the potential for in-situ non-destructive testing using X-ray imaging in industrial additive manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>How to image single isolated atoms by using coherent low-energy electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent low-energy electrons have been demonstrated as a practical tool for imaging individual macromolecules and two-dimensional (2D) crystals. Low-energy electrons exhibit unique properties: low radiation damage to biological molecules and high sensitivity to the local potentials. In this study, we outline the conditions at which single isolated charge-free atoms can be imaged by low-energy electron holography. A single atom produces an interference pattern consisting of concentric fringes of finite diameter and of very weak intensity. The diffraction angle theta, determined as the first minimum of the concentric rings interference pattern, exhibits similar dependency on the source-to-sample distance zs as sin(theta) ~ 0.3/sqrt(zs) for electrons of different energies (50, 100 and 200 eV) and scattered off different elements (Li, C, and Cs). The results are compared to the recently reported experimental holograms of alkali atoms intercalated into bilayer graphene and adsorbed on top of graphene.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy low-noise electrical measurements in a closed-cycle pulse-tube cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A shift of paradigm to obtain (sub-)Kelvin environment is currently on-going with the democratization of cryogen-free cryocoolers, boosted by their easy-to-use and continuous operation without the need of liquid helium whose cost and scarcity globally increase. Thanks to their large sample space and cooling power, they can host a superconducting magnet and are an adapted platform for quantum technologies, material science, low temperature detectors and even medical fields. The drawback is that this type of system is inherently based on gas compression that induces a certain level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, which can potentially prevent the determination of low amplitude signals or spoil their stability. In this paper we demonstrate that pulse-tube based cryocoolers can be used for electrical precision measurements, using a commercial cryomagnetic system combined with our home-made a coaxial cryoprobe. In particular, parts-per-billion level of measurement uncertainties in resistance determination, based on quantum Hall resistance standards, is achievable at the level of state-of-the-art measurements involving conventional cryostats based on liquid helium. We performed an extensive characterization of the cryomagnetic system to determine the level of vibrations and electromagnetic perturbations, and revealed that although the magnetic field has a drastic effect on the noise level, only marginal interplays on the measurement are observed as long as the working frequencies of the instrumentation are not in the vicinity of the ones of the perturbations. The set of characterization measurements presented here are easily implementable in laboratories, which can help to determine the vibrations and electromagnetic pollution generated by any cryocooler.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new and comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs). HBARs demonstrate several very sharp resonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency range. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses significant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models the unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate (a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and critically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which imparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use of fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and sets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical device, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband datasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously fitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1 GHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling coefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by leveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be easily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes, multiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting measured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various perturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be useful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and sensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>A minimalist self-differencing gating scheme for dead-time-free single-photon avalanche diodes at high repetition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gated quenched SPAD detectors are widely used in quantum communication and quantum computing setups employing high-repetition-rate lasers. Here, we present a novel scheme for high-repetition-rate (100 MHz) sine-wave gated SPADs, based on the self-differencing technique, which significantly simplifies previous designs while offering additional advantages. These include straightforward implementation, more precise control of the SPAD biasing, and an improved SNR. We implemented this approach using an InGaAs photodiode and characterized it experimentally with 100 MHz attenuated laser pulses, measuring quantum efficiency, dark count rate, and afterpulsing behavior. Importantly, we demonstrate that the detector recovers full quantum efficiency in less than one pulse-repetition period after a detection event, enabling continuous operation at 100 MHz, which, in principle, could reach the GHz regime.</description>

      <title>An exploratory study of a tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator based on water and p-dioxane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tellurium-loaded liquid scintillators are critical for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. However, conventional organic scintillators are constrained by the limited solubility of organic tellurium compounds, whereas water-based scintillators are likely constrained by the destabilization of surfactants caused by inorganic tellurium compounds. In this work, a surfactant-free water-containing route is explored, in which an aqueous tellurium solution is introduced into a water-miscible organic scintillator comprising p-dioxane, naphthalene, and PPO. The phase behavior of this system is mapped to delineate homogeneous-mixture domains and to estimate practical upper bounds on tellurium loading. Optical properties are characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The scintillation light yield is obtained with a relative method that compares to a reference LAB-PPO scintillator. The measurements demonstrate scintillation quenching induced by water and by tellurium compounds. These results provide benchmarks for water-containing and surfactant-free formulations and support the development of high-loading liquid scintillators for future detector design.</description>

      <title>Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the convergence properties of a collection of iterative electron ptychography methods, under low electron doses ($&lt;$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$) and gives particular attention to the impact of the user-defined update strengths. We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result.</description>

      <title>Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.</description>

      <title>Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</description>
