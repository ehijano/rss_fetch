      <title>Microservice Vulnerability Analysis: A Literature Review with Empirical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microservice architectures are revolutionizing both small businesses and large corporations, igniting a new era of innovation with their exceptional advantages in maintainability, reusability, and scalability. However, these benefits come with significant security challenges, as the increased complexity of service interactions, expanded attack surfaces, and intricate dependency management introduce a new array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While security concerns are mounting, there is a lack of comprehensive research that integrates a review of existing knowledge with empirical analysis of microservice vulnerabilities. This study aims to fill this gap by gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing existing literature on security vulnerabilities associated with microservice architectures. Through a thorough examination of 62 studies, we identify, analyze, and report 126 security vulnerabilities inherent in microservice architectures. This comprehensive analysis enables us to (i) propose a taxonomy that categorizes microservice vulnerabilities based on the distinctive features of microservice architectures; (ii) conduct an empirical analysis by performing vulnerability scans on four diverse microservice benchmark applications using three different scanning tools to validate our taxonomy; and (iii) map our taxonomy vulnerabilities with empirically identified vulnerabilities, providing an in-depth vulnerability analysis at microservice, application, and scanning tool levels. Our study offers crucial guidelines for practitioners and researchers to advance both the state-of-the-practice and the state-of-the-art in securing microservice architectures.</description>

      <title>EdgeShield: A Universal and Efficient Edge Computing Framework for Robust AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of adversarial attacks on Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has created a need for innovative security measures. However, the current methods of defending against these attacks often come with a high computing cost and require back-end processing, making real-time defense challenging. Fortunately, there have been remarkable advancements in edge-computing, which make it easier to deploy neural networks on edge devices. Building upon these advancements, we propose an edge framework design to enable universal and efficient detection of adversarial attacks. This framework incorporates an attention-based adversarial detection methodology and a lightweight detection network formation, making it suitable for a wide range of neural networks and can be deployed on edge devices. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted evaluations on five neural networks. The results indicate an impressive 97.43% F-score can be achieved, demonstrating the framework's proficiency in detecting adversarial attacks. Moreover, our proposed framework also exhibits significantly reduced computing complexity and cost in comparison to previous detection methods. This aspect is particularly beneficial as it ensures that the defense mechanism can be efficiently implemented in real-time on-edge devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's contemporary digital landscape, chatbots have become indispensable tools across various sectors, streamlining customer service, providing personal assistance, automating routine tasks, and offering health advice. However, their potential remains underexplored in the realm of network security, particularly for intrusion detection. To bridge this gap, we propose an architecture chatbot specifically designed to enhance security within edge networks specifically for intrusion detection. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this chatbot will monitor network traffic to identify and mitigate potential intrusions. By securing the network environment using an edge network managed by a Raspberry Pi module and ensuring ethical user consent promoting transparency and trust, this innovative solution aims to safeguard sensitive data and maintain a secure workplace, thereby addressing the growing need for robust network security measures in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Network Intrusion Detection using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing tasks, particularly as chat agents. However, their applicability to threat detection problems remains unclear. This paper examines the feasibility of employing LLMs as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), despite their high computational requirements, primarily for the sake of explainability. Furthermore, considerable resources have been invested in developing LLMs, and they may offer utility for NIDS. Current state-of-the-art NIDS rely on artificial benchmarking datasets, resulting in skewed performance when applied to real-world networking environments. Therefore, we compare the GPT-4 and LLama3 models against traditional architectures and transformer-based models to assess their ability to detect malicious NetFlows without depending on artificially skewed datasets, but solely on their vast pre-trained acquired knowledge. Our results reveal that, although LLMs struggle with precise attack detection, they hold significant potential for a path towards explainable NIDS. Our preliminary exploration shows that LLMs are unfit for the detection of Malicious NetFlows. Most promisingly, however, these exhibit significant potential as complementary agents in NIDS, particularly in providing explanations and aiding in threat response when integrated with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling capabilities.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy to Clear: Elucidating the Threat Hunter Cognitive Process and Cognitive Support Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With security threats increasing in frequency and severity, it is critical that we consider the important role of threat hunters. These highly-trained security professionals learn to see, identify, and intercept security threats. Many recent works and existing tools in cybersecurity are focused on automating the threat hunting process, often overlooking the critical human element. Our study shifts this paradigm by emphasizing a human-centered approach to understanding the lived experiences of threat hunters. By observing threat hunters during hunting sessions and analyzing the rich insights they provide, we seek to advance the understanding of their cognitive processes and the tool support they need. Through an in-depth observational study of threat hunters, we introduce a model of how they build and refine their mental models during threat hunting sessions. We also present 23 themes that provide a foundation to better understand threat hunter needs and five actionable design propositions to enhance the tools that support them. Through these contributions, our work enriches the theoretical understanding of threat hunting and provides practical insights for designing more effective, human-centered cybersecurity tools.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Encryption Scheme Based on Quasigroup Using Chained Mode of Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel construction for a symmetric encryption scheme, referred as SEBQ which is based on the structure of quasigroup. We utilize concepts of chaining like mode of operation and present a block cipher with in-built properties. We prove that SEBQ shows resistance against chosen plaintext attack (CPA) and by applying unbalanced Feistel transformation [19], it achieves security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA). Subsequently, we conduct an assessment of the randomness of the proposed scheme by running the NIST test suite and we analyze the impact of the initial vector, secret key and plaintext on ciphertext through an avalanche effect analysis. We also compare the results with existing schemes based on quasigroups [11,46]. Moreover, we analyze the computational complexity in terms of number of operations needed for encryption and decryption process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), automotive ethernet has emerged as a critical technology for in-vehicle networks (IVNs), superseding traditional protocols like the CAN due to its superior bandwidth and data transmission capabilities. This study explores the detection of camera interference attacks (CIA) within an automotive ethernet-driven environment using a novel GRU-based IDS. Leveraging a sliding-window data preprocessing technique, our IDS effectively analyzes packet length sequences to differentiate between normal and anomalous data transmissions. Experimental evaluations conducted on a commercial car equipped with H.264 encoding and fragmentation unit-A (FU-A) demonstrated high detection accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.9982 and a true positive rate of 0.99 with a window size of 255.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution Networks -- Key Management: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure communication makes the widespread use of telecommunication networks and services possible. With the constant progress of computing and mathematics, new cryptographic methods are being diligently developed. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technology that provides an Information-Theoretically Secure (ITS) solution to the secret-key agreement problem between two remote parties. QKD networks based on trusted repeaters are built to provide service to a larger number of parties at arbitrary distances. They function as an add-on technology to traditional networks, generating, managing, distributing, and supplying ITS cryptographic keys. Since key resources are limited, integrating QKD network services into critical infrastructures necessitates effective key management. As a result, this paper provides a comprehensive review of QKD network key management approaches. They are analyzed to facilitate the identification of potential strategies and accelerate the future development of QKD networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ongoing discourse surrounding integrating QKD networks as a service for critical infrastructures, key storage design often receives insufficient attention. Nonetheless, it bears crucial significance as it profoundly impacts the efficiency of QKD network services, thereby shaping its suitability for diverse applications. In this article, we analyze the effectiveness of key storage designs developed through practical testbeds and propose a novel key storage design to increase the effectiveness of key creation and supply. All key storage designs underwent analysis using network simulation tools, and the findings demonstrate that the novel key storage design surpasses existing approaches in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring RAG-based Vulnerability Augmentation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting vulnerabilities is a crucial task for maintaining the integrity, availability, and security of software systems. Utilizing DL-based models for vulnerability detection has become commonplace in recent years. However, such deep learning-based vulnerability detectors (DLVD) suffer from a shortage of sizable datasets to train effectively. Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the shortage of data, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires designing a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Hence, the work on generating vulnerable code samples has been limited and previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Lately, large language models (LLMs) are being used for solving various code generation and comprehension tasks and have shown inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). In this study, we explore three different strategies to augment vulnerabilities both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our proposed approach on three vulnerability datasets and three DLVD models, using two LLMs. Our results show that our injection-based clustering-enhanced RAG method beats the baseline setting (NoAug), Vulgen, and VGX (two SOTA methods), and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 30.80\%, 27.48\%, 27.93\%, and 15.41\% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84\%, 54.10\%, 69.90\%, and 40.93\% with 15K generated vulnerable samples. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility for large-scale data augmentation by generating 1K samples at as cheap as US$ 1.88.</description>

      <title>FDI: Attack Neural Code Generation Systems through User Feedback Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural code generation systems have recently attracted increasing attention to improve developer productivity and speed up software development. Typically, these systems maintain a pre-trained neural model and make it available to general users as a service (e.g., through remote APIs) and incorporate a feedback mechanism to extensively collect and utilize the users' reaction to the generated code, i.e., user feedback. However, the security implications of such feedback have not yet been explored. With a systematic study of current feedback mechanisms, we find that feedback makes these systems vulnerable to feedback data injection (FDI) attacks. We discuss the methodology of FDI attacks and present a pre-attack profiling strategy to infer the attack constraints of a targeted system in the black-box setting. We demonstrate two proof-of-concept examples utilizing the FDI attack surface to implement prompt injection attacks and backdoor attacks on practical neural code generation systems. The attacker may stealthily manipulate a neural code generation system to generate code with vulnerabilities, attack payload, and malicious and spam messages. Our findings reveal the security implications of feedback mechanisms in neural code generation systems, paving the way for increasing their security.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Visual Information: A Reconstruction Attack Against Adversarial Visual Information Hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of adversarial-example-based image encryption by executing data reconstruction (DR) attacks on encrypted images. A representative image encryption method is the adversarial visual information hiding (AVIH), which uses type-I adversarial example training to protect gallery datasets used in image recognition tasks. In the AVIH method, the type-I adversarial example approach creates images that appear completely different but are still recognized by machines as the original ones. Additionally, the AVIH method can restore encrypted images to their original forms using a predefined private key generative model. For the best security, assigning a unique key to each image is recommended; however, storage limitations may necessitate some images sharing the same key model. This raises a crucial security question for AVIH: How many images can safely share the same key model without being compromised by a DR attack? To address this question, we introduce a dual-strategy DR attack against the AVIH encryption method by incorporating (1) generative-adversarial loss and (2) augmented identity loss, which prevent DR from overfitting -- an issue akin to that in machine learning. Our numerical results validate this approach through image recognition and re-identification benchmarks, demonstrating that our strategy can significantly enhance the quality of reconstructed images, thereby requiring fewer key-sharing encrypted images. Our source code to reproduce our results will be available soon.</description>

      <title>Constructing Adversarial Examples for Vertical Federated Learning: Optimal Client Corruption through Multi-Armed Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL), where each participating client holds a subset of data features, has found numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT systems. However, adversarial attacks, particularly through the injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the security of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities through developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a practical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset of clients. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an online optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of adversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern selection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the formulated CPS problem and a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the adversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption. The key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum reward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of competitive arms, on which the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly reduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively large as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the regret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently revealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate, under various datasets of popular VFL tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.07309v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies that has grabbed the attention of researchers from academia and industry. The idea behind Internet of things is the interconnection of internet enabled things or devices to each other and to humans, to achieve some common goals. In near future IoT is expected to be seamlessly integrated into our environment and human will be wholly solely dependent on this technology for comfort and easy life style. Any security compromise of the system will directly affect human life. Therefore security and privacy of this technology is foremost important issue to resolve. In this paper we present a thorough study of security problems in IoT and classify possible cyberattacks on each layer of IoT architecture. We also discuss challenges to traditional security solutions such as cryptographic solutions, authentication mechanisms and key management in IoT. Device authentication and access controls is an essential area of IoT security, which is not surveyed so far. We spent our efforts to bring the state of the art device authentication and access control techniques on a single paper.</description>

      <title>Albatross: An optimistic consensus algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.01589v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The consensus protocol is a critical component of distributed ledgers and blockchains. Achieving consensus over a decentralized network poses challenges to transaction finality and performance. Currently, the highest-performing consensus algorithms are speculative BFT algorithms, which, however, compromise on the transaction finality guarantees offered by their non-speculative counterparts.
  In this paper, we introduce Albatross, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain consensus algorithm that aims to combine the best of both worlds. At its heart, Albatross is a high-performing, speculative BFT algorithm that offers strong probabilistic finality. We complement this by periodically guaranteeing finality through the Tendermint protocol. We prove our protocol to be secure under standard BFT assumptions and analyze its performance both on a theoretical and practical level. For that, we provide an open-source Rust implementation of Albatross. Our real-world measurements support that our protocol has a performance close to the theoretical maximum for single-chain Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.</description>

Abstract: Smart contracts have played a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchains and Decentralized Applications (DApps). As DApps continue to gain widespread adoption, multiple smart contract languages have been and are being made available to developers, each with its distinctive features, strengths, and weaknesses. In this paper, we examine the smart contract languages used in major blockchain platforms, with the goal of providing a comprehensive assessment of their main properties. Our analysis targets the programming languages rather than the underlying architecture: as a result, while we do consider the interplay between language design and blockchain model, our main focus remains on language-specific features such as usability, programming style, safety and security. To conduct our assessment, we propose an original benchmark which encompasses a wide, yet manageable, spectrum of key use cases that cut across all the smart contract languages under examination.</description>

      <title>DREAM: Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation in Malware Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based malware classifiers face significant challenges due to concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has primarily focused on detecting drift samples, relying on expert-led analysis and labeling for model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To address these limitations, we introduce DREAM, a novel system designed to surpass the capabilities of existing drift detectors and to establish an explanatory drift adaptation process. DREAM enhances drift detection through model sensitivity and data autonomy. The detector, trained in a semi-supervised approach, proactively captures malware behavior concepts through classifier feedback. During testing, it utilizes samples generated by the detector itself, eliminating reliance on extensive training data. For drift adaptation, DREAM enlarges human intervention, enabling revisions of malware labels and concept explanations embedded within the detector's latent space. To ensure a comprehensive response to concept drift, it facilitates a coordinated update process for both the classifier and the detector. Our evaluation shows that DREAM can effectively improve the drift detection accuracy and reduce the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers.</description>

      <title>Improving the Privacy Loss Under User-Level DP Composition for Fixed Estimation Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the private release of statistics of several disjoint subsets of a datasets. In particular, we consider the $\epsilon$-user-level differentially private release of sample means and variances of sample values in disjoint subsets of a dataset, in a potentially sequential manner. Traditional analysis of the privacy loss under user-level privacy due to the composition of queries to the disjoint subsets necessitates a privacy loss degradation by the total number of disjoint subsets. Our main contribution is an iterative algorithm, based on suppressing user contributions, which seeks to reduce the overall privacy loss degradation under a canonical Laplace mechanism, while not increasing the worst estimation error among the subsets. Important components of this analysis are our exact, analytical characterizations of the sensitivities and the worst-case bias errors of estimators of the sample mean and variance, which are obtained by clipping or suppressing user contributions. We test the performance of our algorithm on real-world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate improvements in the privacy loss degradation factor, for fixed estimation error. We also show improvements in the worst-case error across subsets, via a natural optimization procedure, for fixed numbers of users contributing to each subset.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Security Benefits and Overheads of Emerging Industry Solutions to DRAM Read Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first rigorous security, performance, energy, and cost analyses of the state-of-the-art on-DRAM-die read disturbance mitigation method, Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC), described in JEDEC DDR5 specification's April 2024 update. Unlike prior state-of-the-art that advises the memory controller to periodically issue refresh management (RFM) commands, which provides the DRAM chip with time to perform refreshes, PRAC introduces a new back-off signal. PRAC's back-off signal propagates from the DRAM chip to the memory controller and forces the memory controller to 1) stop serving requests and 2) issue RFM commands. As a result, RFM commands are issued when needed as opposed to periodically, reducing RFM's overheads. We analyze PRAC in four steps. First, we define an adversarial access pattern that represents the worst-case for PRAC's security. Second, we investigate PRAC's configurations and security implications. Our analyses show that PRAC can be configured for secure operation as long as no bitflip occurs before accessing a memory location 10 times. Third, we evaluate the performance impact of PRAC and compare it against prior works using Ramulator 2.0. Our analysis shows that while PRAC incurs less than 13% performance overhead for today's DRAM chips, its performance overheads can reach up to 94% for future DRAM chips that are more vulnerable to read disturbance bitflips. Fourth, we define an availability adversarial access pattern that exacerbates PRAC's performance overhead to perform a memory performance attack, demonstrating that such an adversarial pattern can hog up to 94% of DRAM throughput and degrade system throughput by up to 95%. We discuss PRAC's implications on future systems and foreshadow future research directions. To aid future research, we open-source our implementations and scripts at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator2.</description>

      <title>The Use of Large Language Models (LLM) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in Cybercrime Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from cybercrime forums, which contain extensive information and key discussions about emerging cyber threats. However, to date, the level of accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for such critical tasks has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study assesses the accuracy of an LLM system built on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model [7] to extract CTI information. To do so, a random sample of 500 daily conversations from three cybercrime forums, XSS, Exploit_in, and RAMP, was extracted, and the LLM system was instructed to summarize the conversations and code 10 key CTI variables, such as whether a large organization and/or a critical infrastructure is being targeted. Then, two coders reviewed each conversation and evaluated whether the information extracted by the LLM was accurate. The LLM system performed strikingly well, with an average accuracy score of 98%. Various ways to enhance the model were uncovered, such as the need to help the LLM distinguish between stories and past events, as well as being careful with verb tenses in prompts. Nevertheless, the results of this study highlight the efficiency and relevance of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence.</description>

      <title>Duwak: Dual Watermarks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLM) are increasingly used for text generation tasks, it is critical to audit their usages, govern their applications, and mitigate their potential harms. Existing watermark techniques are shown effective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable patterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics. However, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of tokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against post-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity. We theoretically explain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate Duwak extensively on Llama2 under various post-editing attacks, against four state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them. Our results show that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at the lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than existing approaches, especially under post paraphrasing.</description>

      <title>Perturb-and-Project: Differentially Private Similarities and Marginals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the input perturbations framework for differential privacy where noise is added to the input $A\in \mathcal{S}$ and the result is then projected back to the space of admissible datasets $\mathcal{S}$. Through this framework, we first design novel efficient algorithms to privately release pair-wise cosine similarities. Second, we derive a novel algorithm to compute $k$-way marginal queries over $n$ features. Prior work could achieve comparable guarantees only for $k$ even. Furthermore, we extend our results to $t$-sparse datasets, where our efficient algorithms yields novel, stronger guarantees whenever $t\le n^{5/6}/\log n\,.$ Finally, we provide a theoretical perspective on why \textit{fast} input perturbation algorithms works well in practice. The key technical ingredients behind our results are tight sum-of-squares certificates upper bounding the Gaussian complexity of sets of solutions.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.
  This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.
  This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024. Our analyses identify pathways to migrate current applications to be quantum-resistant.</description>
