      <title>Planet Hunters NGTS: New Planet Candidates from a Citizen Science Search of the Next Generation Transit Survey Public Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from the first two years of the Planet Hunters NGTS citizen science project, which searches for transiting planet candidates in data from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) by enlisting the help of members of the general public. Over 8,000 registered volunteers reviewed 138,198 light curves from the NGTS Public Data Releases 1 and 2. We utilize a user weighting scheme to combine the classifications of multiple users to identify the most promising planet candidates not initially discovered by the NGTS team. We highlight the five most interesting planet candidates detected through this search, which are all candidate short-period giant planets. This includes the TIC-165227846 system that, if confirmed, would be the lowest-mass star to host a close-in giant planet. We assess the detection efficiency of the project by determining the number of confirmed planets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) successfully recovered by this search and find that 74% of confirmed planets and 63% of TOIs detected by NGTS are recovered by the Planet Hunters NGTS project. The identification of new planet candidates shows that the citizen science approach can provide a complementary method to the detection of exoplanets with ground-based surveys such as NGTS.</description>

      <title>Host Stars and How Their Compositions Influence Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has become a common practice within the exoplanet field to say that "to know the star is to know the planet." The properties of the host star have a strong, direct influence on the interior and surface conditions of the orbiting planet and oftentimes measurements of planetary properties are made relative to the star's properties. Not only are observational measurements of the star necessary to determine even the most basic aspects of the planet (such as mass and radius), but the stellar environment influences how the planet evolves. Therefore, in this chapter, we begin by discussing the basics of stars, providing an overview of stellar formation, structure, photon and particle emissions, and evolution. Next, we go over the possible ways to determine the age of a star. We then outline how different kinds of stars are distributed within the Milky Way galaxy. Afterwards, we explain how to measure the composition of stars and the underlying math inherent to those observations, including caveats that are important when using the data for research applications. Finally, we explain the underlying physics and observations that enable stellar composition to be used as a proxy for planetary composition. In addition, given that this chapter focuses more on astronomy/astrophysics and uses a variety of important terms that may not be familiar to all readers, we have defined many terms either within the text or as a footnote for better interdisciplinary comprehension.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets are formed inside disks around young stars. The gas, dust, and ice in these natal disks are the building materials of planets, and therefore their compositions fundamentally shape the final chemical compositions of planets. In this review, we summarize current observations of molecular lines in protoplanetary disks, from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. We discuss the basic types of chemical reactions in disks and the current development of chemical modeling. In particular, we highlight the progress made in understanding snowline locations, abundances of main carriers of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, and complex organic molecules in disks. Finally, we discuss efforts to trace planet formation history by combining the understanding of disk chemistry and planet formation processes.</description>

      <title>Meteorites and Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteorites are a remarkable resource. They capture the imagination of people worldwide with their spectacular entry through Earth's atmosphere as fireballs, and their exotic character of being pieces of other worlds. Scientifically, they are critical to interpreting the early stages of formation of the Solar System, as well as the geological evolution of asteroids, the Moon, and Mars, and they are vital to understanding planetary formation processes. With the burgeoning exploration of extrasolar planetary systems, knowledge of the fundamental process of planetary growth from protoplanetary disks has taken on a new significance. Meteorites provide essential and detailed insight into the formation of planetary systems, although we must bear in mind that they only represent one reference point (our own Solar System) in what is clearly a wide spectrum of possible chemical and physical parameters governing the diverse realm of extrasolar planets. This chapter summarises the nature of our meteorite collections, and the ways in which meteorites contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of our own Solar System, with broader implications for planetary systems in general.</description>

      <title>The chemistry of extra-solar materials from white dwarf planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf planetary systems provide a unique way to measure the bulk composition of exoplanetary material. Extrasolar asteroids/comets/moons which have survived the evolution of their host star can end up in the atmosphere of the white dwarf. Asteroids and boulders appear to be the most common pollutants, where we use the term "asteroids" to refer to the parent body that is polluting the atmosphere. The presence of the planetary material is detected via absorption lines of heavy elements. White dwarfs with these absorption features are called "polluted" white dwarfs. Polluted white dwarfs were expected to be rare objects because white dwarfs have high surface gravities, therefore, these heavy elements will settle out of the white dwarf's atmospheres in a short amount of time (Paquette et al. 1986). However, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys found that 25-50% of white dwarfs are polluted (Zuckerman et al. 2003, 2010; Koester et al. 2014). The mechanism responsible for making a polluted white dwarf must be common and efficient. There is strong theoretical and observational evidence that white dwarfs are accreting from planetary material. There are different mechanisms that can deliver exoplanetary material into the Roche lobe of the white dwarf. Debris disks, transits from disintegrating bodies, and intact planets have all been detected around white dwarfs (e.g., Jura et al. 2007; Vanderburg et al. 2015, 2020). This chapter will describe how the chemical autopsies are conducted, and what is learnt about exoplanetary material from polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Mineralogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter begins with some basic concepts regarding the structure and mineralogy of rocky planets, how to read and construct ternary diagrams, and why partial melting occurs when plate tectonics is operative. Partial melting is a key concept in that it governs crust and core formation, which in turn control mineralogy. These sections are for astronomers, or geologists new to the study of igneous petrology. From there, computational approaches for estimating planetary mineral assemblages will be introduced. These quantitative methods are simple, consonant with the level of information currently available on exoplanet compositions, and while largely intended for mineralogists, should be accessible to non-specialists as well. Such methods are followed by a study of error when plotting mineral abundances in ternary diagrams, for mineralogists and petrologists who construct such diagrams. The chapter concludes with caveats, and the ways in which exoplanets might surprise us.</description>

      <title>From stars to diverse mantles, melts, crusts and atmospheres of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review is focused on describing the logic by which we make predictions of exoplanetary compositions and mineralogies, and how these processes could lead to compositional diversity among rocky exoplanets. We use these predictions to determine the sensitivity of present-day and future observations to detecting compositional differences between rocky exoplanets and the four terrestrial planets. First, we review data on stellar abundances and infer how changes in composition may manifest themselves in the expected bulk compositions of rocky exoplanets (section 2). Converting this information in mass-radius relationships requires calculation of the stable mineral assemblages at a given temperature-pressure-composition (T-P-X), an exercise we describe in section 3. Should the planet be hot enough to engender partial melting of the mantle, then these liquids are likely to rise to the surface and erupt to form planetary crusts; the possible compositional and mineralogical variability of which we examine in section 4. Finally, the expected spectroscopic responses of such crusts are examined in section 5.</description>

      <title>Some Tectonic Concepts Relevant to the Study of Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We'll examine plate tectonics on Earth -- its features and forces -- and examine some concepts that may allow astronomers to ask useful questions regarding numeric models that putatively predict tectonic activity. But exo-planetologists should be aware that geologists are still attempting to understand: why does Earth operates as it does, and so much differently than its neighbors? Has it always operated this way and have other planets of the inner Solar System ever mimicked Earth's behavior in their past? These problems are unsolved, though some interesting speculative notions have emerged. Studies by Foley et al. et al. (2012) and Weller and Lenardic (2018), for example, attempt to distill the essential planetary properties that may influence if not dictate possible tectonic states, while Yin et al. (2016) propose a model of planetary tectonic surface features that appears remarkably precise. These studies yield some compelling expedients for analyses of planetary objects both within and outside our Solar System.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary magnetic fields are important indicators of planetary processes and evolution, from a planet's outer core to its surface (if it possesses one) to its atmosphere and near-space environment. Magnetic fields are most directly measured in situ, and determining whether distant planetary objects possess magnetic fields can be challenging. At present we have no unambiguous measurements of magnetic fields on exoplanets. Nevertheless, it would be surprising if at least some exoplanets did not generate a magnetic field, like many planetary bodies in the solar system. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of exoplanetary magnetic fields and their consequences. In the next section we review the current understanding of planetary dynamo generation as it applies to solar system objects and discuss the implications for exoplanetary magnetic field generation. Following this, we describe seven methods for determining the existence and strength of an exoplanetary magnetic field and discuss the near-term prospects for each method. We close by highlighting four main consequences of exoplanetary magnetic fields for a planet and its evolution.</description>

      <title>Transiting Exoplanet Atmospheres in the Era of JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of exoplanet atmospheric characterization has recently made considerable advances with the advent of high-resolution spectroscopy from large ground-based telescopes and the commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We have entered an era in which atmospheric compositions, aerosol properties, thermal structures, mass loss, and three-dimensional effects can be reliably constrained. While the challenges of remote sensing techniques imply that individual exoplanet atmospheres will likely never be characterized to the degree of detail that is possible for solar system bodies, exoplanets present an exciting opportunity to characterize a diverse array of worlds with properties that are not represented in our solar system. This review article summarizes the current state of exoplanet atmospheric studies for transiting planets. We focus on how observational results inform our understanding of exoplanet properties and ultimately address broad questions about planetary formation, evolution, and diversity. This review is meant to provide an overview of the exoplanet atmospheres field for planetary- and geo-scientists without astronomy backgrounds, and exoplanet specialists, alike. We give special attention to the first year of JWST data and recent results in high-resolution spectroscopy that have not been summarized by previous review articles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter reviews proposed exoplanet biosignatures, including their biological origins, observable features, atmospheric sinks, and potentially confounding abiotic sources. Emphasis is placed on material published since past comprehensive reviews while providing a foundational understanding of each named biosignature. Topics include possible gaseous biosignatures (e.g., O$_2$, O$_3$, CH$_4$, N$_2$O, DMS, CH$_3$Cl, C$_5$H$_8$, NH$_3$, PH$_3$), surface biosignatures (e.g., vegetation red edge, other pigment features, polarization signatures), and temporal biosignatures (e.g., atmospheric seasonality). Potential frameworks for assessing remote biosignatures are described. Text and table summaries provide references to relevant original research articles.</description>

      <title>The early Earth as an analogue for exoplanetary biogeochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet Earth has evolved from an entirely anoxic planet with possibly a different tectonic regime to the oxygenated world with horizontal plate tectonics that we know today. For most of this time, Earth has been inhabited by a purely microbial biosphere albeit with seemingly increasing complexity over time. A rich record of this geobiological evolution over most of Earth's history provides insights into the remote detectability of microbial life under a variety of planetary conditions. We leverage Earth's geobiological record with the aim of a) illustrating the current state of knowledge and key knowledge gaps about the early Earth as a reference point in exoplanet science research; b) compiling biotic and abiotic mechanisms that controlled the evolution of the atmosphere over time; and c) reviewing current constraints on the detectability of Earth's early biosphere with state-of-the-art telescope technology. We highlight that life may have originated on a planet with a different tectonic regime and strong hydrothermal activity, and under these conditions, biogenic CH$_4$ gas was perhaps the most detectable atmospheric biosignature. Oxygenic photosynthesis, which is responsible for essentially all O$_2$ gas in the modern atmosphere, appears to have emerged concurrently with the establishment of modern plate tectonics and the continental crust, but O$_2$ accumulation to modern levels only occurred late in Earth's history, perhaps tied to the rise of land plants. Nutrient limitation in anoxic oceans, promoted by hydrothermal Fe = fluxes, may have limited biological productivity and O$_2$ production. N$_2$O is an alternative biosignature that was perhaps significant on the redox-stratified Proterozoic Earth. We conclude that the detectability of atmospheric biosignatures on Earth was not only dependent on biological evolution but also strongly controlled by the evolving tectonic context.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Geology: What can we learn from current and future observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly 30 years after the discovery of the first exoplanet around a main sequence star, thousands of planets have now been confirmed. These discoveries have completely revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems, revealing types of planets that do not exist in our solar system but are common in extrasolar systems, and a wide range of system architectures. Our solar system is clearly not the default for planetary systems. The community is now moving beyond basic characterization of exoplanets (mass, radius, and orbits) towards a deeper characterization of their atmospheres and even surfaces. With improved observational capabilities there is potential to now probe the geology of rocky exoplanets; this raises the possibility of an analogous revolution in our understanding of rocky planet evolution. However, characterizing the geology or geological processes occurring on rocky exoplanets is a major challenge, even with next generation telescopes. This chapter reviews what we may be able to accomplish with these efforts in the near-term and long-term. In the near-term, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing which rocky planets lose versus retain their atmospheres. This chapter discusses the implications of such discoveries, including how even planets with no or minimal atmospheres can still provide constraints on surface geology and long-term geological evolution. Longer-term possibilities are then reviewed, including whether the hypothesis of climate stabilization by the carbonate-silicate cycle can be tested by next generation telescopes. New modeling strategies sweeping through ranges of possibly evolutionary scenarios will be needed to use the current and future observations to constrain rocky exoplanet geology and evolution.</description>

      <title>Pwyll and Manann\'an Craters as a Laboratory for Constraining Irradiation Timescales on Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine high spatial resolution Galileo/NIMS observations of the young (~1 My - 20 My) impact features, Pwyll and Manann\'{a}n craters, on Europa's trailing hemisphere in an effort to constrain irradiation timescales. We characterize their composition using a linear spectral modeling analysis and find that both craters and their ejecta are depleted in hydrated sulfuric acid relative to nearby older terrain. This suggests that the radiolytic sulfur cycle has not yet had enough time to build up an equilibrium concentration of H2SO4, and places a strong lower limit of the age of the craters on the equilibrium timescale of the radiolytic sulfur cycle on Europa's trailing hemisphere. Additionally, we find that the dark and red material seen in the craters and proximal ejecta of Pwyll and Manann\'{a}n show the spectroscopic signature of hydrated, presumably endogenic salts. This suggests that the irradiation-induced darkening and redenning of endogenic salts thought to occur on Europa's trailing hemisphere has already happened at Pwyll and Manann\'{a}n, thereby placing an upper limit on the timescale by which salts are irradiation reddened.</description>

      <title>A New Parameterization for Finding Solutions for Microlensing Exoplanet Light Curves</title>

Abstract: The gravitational microlensing method of discovering exoplanets and multi-star systems can produce degenerate solutions, some of which require in-depth analysis to uncover. We propose a new parameter space that can be used to sample potential solutions more efficiently and is more robust at finding all degenerate solutions. We identified two new parameters, k and h, that can be sampled in place of the mass ratios and separations of the systems under analysis to identify degenerate solutions. The parameter k is related to the size of the central caustic, $\Delta\xi_c$, while h is related to the distance of a point along the k contour from log(s)=0, where s is the projected planet-host separation. In this work, we present the characteristics of these parameters and the tests we conducted to prove their efficacy.</description>

      <title>A Population Analysis of 20 Exoplanets Observed from the Optical of the Near-infrared Wavelengths with HST: Evidence for Widespread Stellar Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a population study of 20 exoplanets, ranging from Neptune-like to inflated hot-Jupiter planets, observed during transit with the STIS and WFC3 instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. To obtain spectral information from the near-UV to the near-infrared, we reanalysed sixteen WFC3 and over fifty STIS archival data sets with our dedicated HST pipeline. We also include twenty-four WFC3 data sets previously reduced with the same software. Across our target sample we observe significant divergence among multiple observations conducted with the same STIS grating at various epochs, whilst we do not detect variations in the WFC3 data sets. These results are suggestive of stellar contamination, which we have investigated further using known Bayesian tools and other tailored metrics, facilitating a more objective assessment of stellar activity intensity within each system. Our findings reveal that stellar activity contaminates up to half of the studied exoplanet atmospheres, albeit at varying extents. Accounting for stellar activity can significantly alter planetary atmospheric parameters like molecular abundances (up to 6 orders of magnitude) and temperature (up to 145 %), contrasting with the results of analyses that neglect activity. Our results emphasise the importance of considering the effects of stellar contamination in exoplanet transit studies; this issue is particularly true for data sets obtained with facilities that do not cover the optical and/or UV spectral range where the activity is expected to be more impactful but also more easily detectable. Our results also provide a catalogue of potentially active stars for further investigation and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Planet formation -- observational constraints, physical processes, and compositional patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of planet formation as a field of study is not only to provide the understanding of how planets come into existence. It is also an interdisciplinary bridge which links astronomy to geology and mineralogy. Recent observations of young stars accompanied by their protoplanetary disks (Manara et al. 2022) provide direct insights into the conditions at which planets are forming. These astronomical observations can be taken as initial conditions for the models of planet formation. In this chapter, we first give an brief overview of key observational constraints for planet formation theory derived from both the solar system and from the exoplanet population. We then review physical mechanisms governing planetary system formation and discuss how they can be put together to form global planet formation models. Finally, we discuss how the compositional links from protoplanetary disks to planetary atmospheres put novel constraints on planet formation theory. In particular, we are currently gaining insights into the composition of the inner, planet-forming region within the disks thanks to observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (Grant et al. 2023; Perotti et al. 2023). The task for planet formation modelling is then to link these observational properties and compositional content to the physical properties, and also the elementary inventory of meteorites, the Moon, Earth, and the other planets. If successful, this global approach can provide useful constraints for geological studies.</description>

      <title>CAI formation in the early Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest dated solid materials in the solar system, found as light-coloured crystalline ingredients in meteorites. Their formation time is commonly associated with age zero of the Solar System. Yet, the physical and chemical processes that once led to the formation of these sub-millimetre to centimetre-sized mineral particles in the early solar nebula are still a matter of debate. This paper proposes a pathway to form such inclusions during the earliest phases of disc evolution. We combine 1D viscous disc evolutionary models with 2D radiative transfer, equilibrium condensation, and new dust opacity calculations. We show that the viscous heating associated with the high accretion rates in the earliest evolutionary phases causes the midplane inside of about 0.5 au to heat up to limiting temperatures of about 1500-1700 K, but no further. These high temperatures force all refractory material components of the inherited interstellar dust grains to sublimate - except for a few Al-Ca-Ti oxides such as Al2O3, Ca2Al2SiO7, and CaTiO3. Once the Mg-Fe silicates are gone, the dust becomes more transparent and the heat is more efficiently transported to the disc surface, which prevents any further warm-up. This thermostat mechanism keeps these minerals above their annealing temperature for hundreds of thousands of years, which creates large, pure and crystalline particles. These particles are dragged out by the viscously spreading disc. Beyond about 0.5 au, the silicates re-condense on the Ca-Al-rich particles, adding an amorphous silicate matrix. We estimate that this mechanism to produce CAIs works during the first 50000 years of disc evolution. These particles then continue to move outward and populate the entire disc up to radii of about 50 au, before, eventually, the accretion rate subsides, the disc cools, and the particles start to drift inwards.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent model for dust settling and the vertical shear instability in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of dust particles in protoplanetary disks affects dust evolution and planetesimal formation processes. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate hydrodynamic mechanisms that can generate turbulence in the outer disk region and affect dust diffusion. Turbulence driven by the VSI has a predominant vertical motion that can prevent dust settling. On the other hand, the dust distribution controls the spatial distribution of the gas cooling rate, thereby affecting the strength of VSI-driven turbulence. Here, we present a semi-analytic model that determines the vertical dust distribution and the strength of VSI-driven turbulence in a self-consistent manner. The model uses an empirical formula for the vertical diffusion coefficient in VSI-driven turbulence obtained from our recent hydrodynamical simulations. The formula returns the vertical diffusion coefficient as a function of the vertical profile of the cooling rate, which is determined by the vertical dust distribution. We use this model to search for an equilibrium vertical dust profile where settling balances with turbulent diffusion for a given maximum grain size. We find that if the grains are sufficiently small, there exists a stable equilibrium dust distribution where VSI-driven turbulence is sustained at a level of alpha_z ~ 10^{-3}, where alpha_z is the dimensionless vertical diffusion coefficient. However, as the maximum grain size increases, the equilibrium solution vanishes because the VSI can no longer stop the settling of the grains. This runaway settling may explain highly settled dust rings found in the outer part of some protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Thermal baroclinic instabilities in accretion disks I: Combined dispersion relation for Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke Instability and Convective Overstability in disks around young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability (GSF) and the convective overstability (COS) in the context of baroclinic thermal instabilities in rotating disks around young stars. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a global extension of the GSF that affects geometrically thin disks but follows the same stability criterion. The COS, on the other hand, also possesses a twin for stellar interiors, specifically, Shibahashi's vibrational stability of rotating stars. We derive a combined dispersion relation for GSF and COS with arbitrary cooling times for local perturbations and determine a new stability criterion beyond the Solberg-H{\o}iland\ criterion. The paper shows that in extension to the stability criterion for the vertically unstratified case ($N^2_R &gt; 0$), one also needs a barotropic disk structure to ensure stability towards COS modes. We demonstrate that a baroclinic disk atmosphere always has a buoyantly unstable direction, although not necessarily in the radial nor vertical direction. The paper predicts that for cooling times longer than the critical cooling time for VSI, GSF modes will always be accompanied by COS modes of similar growth rate. The numerical companion paper II tests the predictions of growth rates from this paper.</description>

      <title>Parts-per-billion Trace Element Detection in Anhydrous Minerals by Micro-scale Quantitative NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) composing Earth's and planetary rocks incorporate microscopic amounts of volatiles. However, volatile distribution in NAMs and their effect on physical properties of rocks remain controversial. Thus, constraining trace volatile concentrations in NAMs is tantamount to our understanding of the evolution of rocky planets and planetesimals. Here, we present a novel approach of trace-element quantification using micro-scale Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This approach employs the principle of enhanced mass-sensitivity in NMR microcoils formerly used in \textit{in-situ} high pressure experiments. We were able to demonstrate that this method is in excellent agreement with standard methods across their respective detection capabilities. We show that by simultaneous detection of internal reference nuclei, the quantification sensitivity can be substantially increased, leading to quantifiable trace volatile element amounts of about $50$ wt-ppb measured in a micro-meter sized single anorthitic mineral grain, greatly enhancing detection capabilities of volatiles in geologically important systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, our understanding of magnetic fields in exoplanets remains limited compared to those within our solar system. Planets with magnetic fields emit radio signals primarily due to the Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability mechanism. In this study, we explore the feasibility of detecting radio emissions from exoplanets using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope. Utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we compile information on confirmed exoplanets and estimate their radio emissions using the RBL model. Our analysis reveals that three exoplanets- Qatar-4 b, TOI-1278 b, and WASP-173 A b- exhibit detectable radio signals suitable for observation with the SKA telescope.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates possibility of placing bounds on the parameters, arising from the non-commutative Snyder space-time model and Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) approach, by utilizing seismic data. We investigate the dependence of constraints on the type of realization used for the quantum phase space. Results indicate improved bounds compared to prior studies, with the model parameter $\beta_0$ constrained to be less than $5.2\times 10^{44}$ for certain choice of realizations. This approach demonstrates the potential for using Earth's empirical data to refine constraints on GUP parameters.</description>

      <title>Retrievals of Protoplanetary Disk Parameters using Thermochemical Models: I. Disk Gas Mass from Hydrogen Deuteride Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss statistical relationships between the mass of protoplanetary disks and the hydrogen deuteride (HD) line emission and the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) determined using 3000 ProDiMo disk models. The models have 15 free parameters describing disk physical properties, the central star, and the local radiation field. The sampling of physical parameters is done using a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate the probability density functions of observables as a function of physical parameters. We find that the HD fractional abundance is almost constant even though the UV flux varies by several orders of magnitude. Probing the statistical relation between the physical quantities and the HD flux, we find that low-mass (optically thin) disks display a tight correlation between the average disk gas temperature and HD line flux, while massive disks show no such correlation. We demonstrate that the central star luminosity, disk size, dust size distribution, and HD flux may be used to determine the disk gas mass to within a factor of three. We also find that the far-IR and sub-mm/mm SEDs and the HD flux may serve as strong constraints for determining the disk gas mass to within a factor of two. If the HD lines are fully spectrally resolved ($R\gtrsim 1.5\times10^6, \Delta v=0.2~\rm km\,s^{-1}$), the 56 $\mu$m and 112 $\mu$m HD line profiles alone may constrain the disk gas mass to within a factor of two.</description>

      <title>Dracula's Chivito: discovery of a large edge-on protoplanetary disk with Pan-STARRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a large edge-on protoplanetary disk associated with the infrared source IRAS 23077+6707. The disk's apparent size in the Pan-STARRS (PS1) images is ~11", making this one of the largest known disks on the sky. It is likely a young system, still surrounded by the envelope which is very faint but still visible in the PS1 images in the northern part (alternatively this structure could be filaments from the disk itself). We use the PS1 magnitudes and other available photometric data to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the disk. An optical spectrum indicates that the obscured star is hot, most likely late A. We adopt a distance of 300 pc for this object based on Gaia DR3 extinctions. We model the system using the HOCHUNK3D radiative transfer software and find that the system is consistent with a hot star of effective temperature 8000 K surrounded by a disk of size 1650 AU and mass 0.2 M_solar at inclination 82 degrees.</description>

      <title>Constraining stellar tidal quality factors from planet-induced stellar spin-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of tight star-planet systems is influenced by tidal interactions between the star and the planet, as was shown recently. The rate at which spins and orbits in such a system evolve depends on the stellar and planetary tidal dissipation efficiency. Here, we present a method to constrain the modified tidal quality factor $Q'_*$ of a planet-hosting star whose rotational evolution has been altered by its planet through angular momentum transfer from the planetary orbital motion to the rotation of the stellar convective zone. The altered rotation is estimated from an observed discrepancy of magnetic activity of the planet-hosting star and a coeval companion star, i.e. this method is applicable to star-planet systems with wide stellar companions. We give an example of the planet-hosting wide binary system HD189733 and find that the planet host's modified tidal quality factor is constrained to be $Q'_* \leq 2.33 \times 10^7$.</description>
