      <title>Normal forms of elements in the Weyl algebra and Dixmier Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of A. Joseph says that any nilpotent or semisimple element $z$ in the Weyl algebra $A_1$ over some algebracally closed field $K$ of characterstic 0 has a normal form up to the action of the automorphism group of $A_1$. It is shown in this note that the normal form corresponds to some unique pair of integers $(k,n)$ with $k\ge n\ge 0$, and will be called the Joseph norm form of $z$. Similar results for the symplectic Poisson algebra $S_1$ are obtained. The Dixmier conjecture can be reformulated as follows: For any nilpotent element $z\in A_1$ whose Joseph norm corresponds to $(k,n)$ with $k&gt;n\ge 1$, there exists no $w\in A_1$ with $ [z,w]=1$. It is known to hold true if $k$ and $n$ are coprime. In this note we show that the assertion also holds if $k$ or $n$ is prime. Analogous results for the Jacobian conjecture for $K[X,Y]$ are obtained.</description>

      <title>An open subset of the variety of $n$- dimensional algebras, classification and automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification, up to isomorphism, of algebras from a subset of the variety of $n$- dimensional algebras is presented. It is shown that the considered subset is an open dense subset of the variety of $n$- dimensional algebras in the case of algebraically closed basic field. It is shown that these algebras have only trivial automorphism.</description>

      <title>A classification of the division algebras that are isotopic to a cyclic Galois field extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify division algebras that are principal Albert isotopes of cyclic Galois field extensions of degree $n&gt;2$ up to isomorphisms. We achieve a "tight" classification when the cyclic Galois field extensions is cubic. The classification is "tight" in the sense that the list of algebras has features that make it easy to distinguish non-isomorphic ones. Rough classification results on regular algebras that are principal Albert isotopes of Galois $C_n$-algebras are obtained as well; the principal Albert isotopes of $C_3$-Galois algebras are again classified up to isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Leibniz algebras with an abelian subalgebra of codimension tw0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characterization of the finite-dimensional Leibniz algebras with an abelian subalgebra of codimension two over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p\neq2$ is given. In short, a finite-dimensional Leibniz algebra of dimension $n$ with an abelian subalgebra of codimension two is solvable and contains an abelian ideal of codimension at most two or it is a direct sum of a Lie one-dimensional solvable extension of the Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak{h}(\mathbb{F})$ and $\mathbb{F}^{n-4}$ or a direct sum of a $3$-dimensional simple Lie algebra and $\mathbb{F}^{n-3}$ or a Leibniz one-dimensional solvable extension of the algebra $\mathfrak{h}(\mathbb{F}) \oplus \mathbb{F}^{n-4}$.</description>

      <title>Computing component groups of stabilizers of nilpotent orbit representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of nilpotent orbits of simple Lie algebras has seen tremendous developments over the past decades. In this context an important role is played by the component group of the stabilizer of a nilpotent element. In this work, the aim is to show computational methods to obtain explicit generators of the component group of the centralizer of a nilpotent element in a simple Lie algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. In some cases such generators had already been determined by impressive hand calculations but these often use the specific form of the chosen representative and are thus not immediately applicable to different representatives of the same orbit. It is then interesting to show how to overcome this issue constructing specific algorithms: for the classical types there is a straightforward method that directly translates well-known theoretical constructions; for the exceptional types we devise a method using the double centralizer of an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple. In particular, it gives an independent construction of the component group, that does not depend on the prior knowledge of its isomorphism type. For our purposes, we needed to construct many algorithms which have been mainly implemented in the computational algebra system GAP.</description>

      <title>A Pride-Guba-Sapir exact sequence for the relation bimodule of an associative algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a presentation of a monoid $M$, combined work of Pride and of Guba and Sapir provides an exact sequence connecting the relation bimodule of the presentation (in the sense of Ivanov) with the first homology of the Squier complex of the presentation, which is naturally a $\mathbb ZM$-bimodule. This exact sequence was used by Kobayashi and Otto to prove the equivalence of Pride's finite homological type (FHT) property with the homological finiteness condition bi-$\mathrm{FP}_3$. Guba and Sapir used this exact sequence to describe the abelianization of a diagram group. We prove here a generalization of this exact sequence of bimodules for presentations of associative algebras. Our proof is more elementary than the original proof for the special case of monoids.</description>

      <title>Picard groups of quasi-Frobenius algebras and a question on Frobenius strongly graded algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our initial aim was to answer the question: does the Frobenius (symmetric) property transfers from a strongly graded algebra to its homogeneous component of trivial degree? Related to it, we investigate invertible bimodules and the Picard group of a finite dimensional quasi-Frobenius algebra $R$. We compute the Picard group, the automorphism group and the group of outer automorphisms of a $9$-dimensional quasi-Frobenius algebra which is not Frobenius, constructed by Nakayama. Using these results and a semitrivial extension construction, we give an example of a symmetric strongly graded algebra whose trivial homogeneous component is not even Frobenius. We investigate associativity of isomorphisms $R^*\ot_RR^*\simeq R$ for quasi-Frobenius algebras $R$, and we determine the order of the class of the invertible bimodule $H^*$ in the Picard group of a finite dimensional Hopf algebra $H$. As an application, we construct new examples of symmetric algebras.</description>

      <title>On von Neumann regularity of ample groupoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the question of when the algebra of an ample groupoid over a field is von Neumann regular and, more generally, when the algebra of a graded ample groupoid is graded von Neumann regular. For fields of characteristic $0$ we are able to provide a complete characterization. Over fields of positive characteristic, we merely have some sufficient and some necessary conditions for regularity. As applications we recover known results on regularity and graded regularity of Leavitt path algebras and inverse semigroups. We also prove a number of new results, in particular concerning graded regularity of algebras of Deaconu-Renault groupoids and Nekrashevych-Exel-Pardo algebras of self-similar groups.</description>
