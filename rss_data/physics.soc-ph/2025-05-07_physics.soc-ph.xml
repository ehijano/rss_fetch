      <title>A raised hand effect as a decision making process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will analyse a group of agents and their attitude to follow, or not, some rules. The model is based on some quantum-like ideas, and in particular on an Hamiltonian operator $H$ describing the dynamics of the agents, assuming they are driven by some mutual interactions and that they are subjected to an external source of "information" used by the agents to decide whether to obey or not these rules. We will discuss how the relative strengths of the parameters of $H$ determine this attitude and we will discuss in particular the role of the external information. We will also apply our general idea to a specific situation, involving drivers and pedestrians trying to cross a road.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Coordination Strategies for Underground Automated Vehicle Fleets in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficiency and safety outcomes of implementing different adaptive coordination models for automated vehicle (AV) fleets, managed by a centralized coordinator that dynamically responds to human-controlled vehicle behavior. The simulated scenarios replicate an underground mining environment characterized by narrow tunnels with limited connectivity. To address the unique challenges of such settings, we propose a novel metric - Path Overlap Density (POD) - to predict efficiency and potentially the safety performance of AV fleets. The study also explores the impact of map features on AV fleets performance. The results demonstrate that both AV fleet coordination strategies and underground tunnel network characteristics significantly influence overall system performance. While map features are critical for optimizing efficiency, adaptive coordination strategies are essential for ensuring safe operations.</description>

      <title>Floating Car Observers in Intelligent Transportation Systems: Detection Modeling and Temporal Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating Car Observers (FCOs) extend traditional Floating Car Data (FCD) by integrating onboard sensors to detect and localize other traffic participants, providing richer and more detailed traffic data. In this work, we explore various modeling approaches for FCO detections within microscopic traffic simulations to evaluate their potential for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. These approaches range from 2D raytracing to high-fidelity co-simulations that emulate real-world sensors and integrate 3D object detection algorithms to closely replicate FCO detections. Additionally, we introduce a neural network-based emulation technique that effectively approximates the results of high-fidelity co-simulations. This approach captures the unique characteristics of FCO detections while offering a fast and scalable solution for modeling. Using this emulation method, we investigate the impact of FCO data in a digital twin of a traffic network modeled in SUMO. Results demonstrate that even at a 20% penetration rate, FCOs using LiDAR-based detections can identify 65% of vehicles across various intersections and traffic demand scenarios. Further potential emerges when temporal insights are integrated, enabling the recovery of previously detected but currently unseen vehicles. By employing data-driven methods, we recover over 80% of these vehicles with minimal positional deviations. These findings underscore the potential of FCOs for ITS, particularly in enhancing traffic state estimation and monitoring under varying penetration rates and traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in AI-human interaction networks: statistics, computation, and probabilistic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing with their ability to generate human-like texts. However, a fundamental challenge remains in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving their emergent behaviors, particularly the randomness in their outputs. This paper investigates the application of spin glass theory as a mathematical framework to quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Moreover, we analyze how the interaction between the noise in LLMs and from social networks shape emergent collective behaviors of the system. By making connections between LLMs and spin glass models, we gain insights into the high-dimensional optimization landscapes of LLMs, the uncertainty in their outputs, and the role of noise in their learning process. We focus on LLMs' ability to replicate human-written flitzes, a form of flirtatious poems unique to Dartmouth College, used to invite peers or a potentially romantic partner to social events. Given flitzes' playful tone, personal references, and role in complex social networks, they represent a uniquely creative form of language, making them ideal for exploring how the temperature parameter in LLMs affects the creativity and verisimilitude of AI-generated content. To better understand where temperature affects model behavior, we look for temperature-based phase transitions through statistical analysis, computational methods, and simulation of our spin glass model. Our findings demonstrate that temperature not only governs randomness in LLM output, but also mediates deeper transitions in linguistic structure, perceived quality, and human-machine alignment. By connecting statistical physics with language generation, we provide a novel framework for understanding emergent behavior in LLMs and their interaction with complex social networks.</description>

      <title>Taskmaster Deconstructed: A Quantitative Look at Tension, Volatility, and Viewer Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taskmaster is a British television show that combines comedic performance with a formal scoring system. Despite the appearance of structured competition, it remains unclear whether scoring dynamics contribute meaningfully to audience engagement. We conducted a statistical analysis of 162 episodes across 18 series, using fifteen episode-level metrics to quantify rank volatility, point spread, lead changes, and winner dominance. None of these metrics showed a significant association with IMDb ratings, even after controlling for series effects. Long-term trends suggest that average points have increased over time, while volatility has slightly declined and rank spread has remained stable. These patterns indicate an attempt to enhance competitive visibility without altering the show's structural equilibrium. We also analyzed contestant rank trajectories and identified five recurring archetypes describing performance styles. These patterns suggest that viewer interest is shaped more by contestant behavior than by game mechanics.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Group Interactions on Climate-related Opinion Change in Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics models describe the evolution of behavioral changes within social networks and are essential for informing strategies aimed at fostering positive collective changes, such as climate action initiatives. When applied to social media interactions, these models typically represent social exchanges in a dyadic format to allow for a convenient encoding of interactions into a graph where edges represent the flow of information from one individual to another. However, this structural assumption fails to adequately reflect the nature of group discussions prevalent on many social media platforms. To address this limitation, we present a temporal hypergraph model that effectively captures the group dynamics inherent in conversational threads, and we apply it to discussions about climate change on Reddit. This model predicts temporal shifts in stance towards climate issues at the level of individual users. In contrast to traditional studies in opinion dynamics that typically rely on simulations or limited empirical validation, our approach is tested against a comprehensive ground truth estimated by a large language model at the level of individual user comments. Our findings demonstrate that using hypergraphs to model group interactions yields superior predictions of the microscopic dynamics of opinion formation, compared to state-of-the-art models based on dyadic interactions. Although our research contributes to the understanding of these complex social systems, significant challenges remain in capturing the nuances of how opinions are formed and evolve within online spaces.</description>

      <title>Predictive processing frameworks for perception can explain recent drone sightings in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We draw on the predictive processing theory of perception to explain why healthy, intelligent, honest, and psychologically normal people might easily misperceive lights in the sky as threatening or extraordinary objects, especially in the context of WEIRD (western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) societies. We argue that the uniquely sparse properties of skyborne and celestial stimuli make it difficult for an observer to update prior beliefs, which can be easily fit to observed lights. Moreover, we hypothesize that humans have likely evolved to perceive the sky and its perceived contents as deeply meaningful. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible role of generalized distrust in scientific institutions and ultimately argue for the importance of astronomy education for producing a society with prior beliefs that support veridical perception.</description>

      <title>Annealing Approximation in Master-Node Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters - R measuring right-oriented influence and L measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.</description>

      <title>Chess variation entropy and engine relevance for humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern chess engines significantly outperform human players and are essential for evaluating positions and move quality. These engines assign a numerical evaluation $E$ to positions, indicating an advantage for either white or black, but similar evaluations can mask varying levels of move complexity. While some move sequences are straightforward, others demand near-perfect play, limiting the practical value of these evaluations for most players. To quantify this problem, we use entropy to measure the complexity of the principal variation (the sequence of best moves). Variations with forced moves have low entropy, while those with multiple viable alternatives have high entropy. Our results show that, except for experts, most human players struggle with high-entropy variations, especially when $|E|&lt;100$ centipawns, which accounts for about $2/3$ of positions. This underscores the need for AI-generated evaluations to convey the complexity of underlying move sequences, as they often exceed typical human cognitive capabilities, reducing their practical utility.</description>

      <title>How do activity-end trip characteristics affect the choice for shared micromobility? A latent class choice modelling approach for train station egress trips in the Netherlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access/egress travel to train stations continues to pose a significant barrier to increasing the number of train travellers. Shared micromobility (SMM), including bicycles, e-bikes, steps and mopeds, is often cited as a prominent solution, especially for the activity-end of the trip chain. Using a stated preference survey, we analyse activity-end mode-choice preferences for SMM, walking and public transport (PT) among the Dutch population. By means of a latent class choice model, we uncover three user groups with respect to activity-end mode choice behaviour. The largest (58%) are Multimodal sharing enthusiast, who choose based on the trade-offs between various travel characteristics, while not having strong modal preferences. They are the most open, ready and able to use SMM. Sharing hesitant cyclists (16%) have a strong preference for cycling and while they are open to using SMM , they may not feel themselves ready, stating that use of SMM can be difficult and dangerous. Sharing-averse PT users (27%) are most likely to use PT and avoid SMM as they find it too difficult and dangerous to use. The high preference to walk for short egress distances reaffirms the need for transit-oriented development policies. For longer egress distances, PT should be the primary focus at stations in high-density areas with high demand, where high frequencies and dense networks are justified, while stations in lower demand areas are better served by SMM. Providing multiple SMM options would result mainly in competition for the same travellers.</description>

      <title>Degrees in Preferential Attachment Networks with an Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a preferential attachment model that incorporates an anomaly. Our goal is to understand the evolution of the network before and after the occurrence of the anomaly by studying the influence of the anomaly on the structural properties of the network. The anomaly is such that after its arrival it attracts newly added edges with fixed probability. We investigate the growth of degrees in the network, finding that the anomaly's degree increases almost linearly. We also provide a heuristic derivation for the exponent of the limiting degree distributions of ordinary vertices, and study the degree growth of the oldest vertex. We show that when the anomaly enters early, the degree distribution is altered significantly, while a late anomaly has minimal impact. Our analysis provides deeper insights into the evolution of preferential attachment networks with an anomalous vertex.</description>

      <title>Barrier induced stalemate-consensus transition of self-propelled participants subject to majority rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural or artificial barriers, such as the Himalayas, the Berlin Wall, or the Korean Demilitarized Zone, can significantly impede human migration. As a consequence, they may also hinder the dissemination of opinions within society, thereby contributing to divergent geopolitical landscapes and cultural developments. This raises a fundamental question: how do such barriers influence the opinion dynamics of mobile agents, such as human beings? In particular, can a barrier induce transitions in collective opinion states among spatially segregated groups? Here, we investigate the opinion dynamics governed by majority rule in a minimal model comprising self-propelled agents with binary opinions performing random walks within a closed space divided by a barrier. We focus on the conditions under which initially segregated clusters of agents with opposing opinions can reach consensus. Our results reveal the existence of a critical barrier size that marks a transition between stalemate and consensus states. Near this critical point, the relaxation time to reach consensus from an initial stalemate exhibits a power-law divergence. This barrier-induced stalemate-consensus transition in a simple agent-based model offers new insights into the role of physical or social barriers in shaping opinion dynamics and social structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model dynamically changing candidate positions in the face of a dynamic electorate. To formulate our equations, we use a space-time-continuous Hegselmann-Krause equation, which we solve using a particle method. We use the combined candidate-voter model to demonstrate the possibility of discontinuous jumps in candidate behavior as parameters of the model are varied. We also extend the analysis to a three candidate scenario. We observe that depending on the parameters, candidates do not always come or stay together at their dynamically evolving position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a structural variational resolution of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) pathologies. By deriving the Variational Kinematic Constraint (VKC) and the Variational Dynamics Constraint (VDC) from the particle's proper-time perspective, we show that self-induced variations are forbidden and dynamics arise solely from first-order proper-time variations of external fields. Consequently, self-force terms are excluded at the variational level, eliminating runaway solutions and non-causal behavior without regularization. Our framework further provides a first-principles derivation of minimal coupling and reveals gauge invariance as a necessary consequence of proper-time-based variational structure.</description>

      <title>Understanding everyday public transit travel habits: a measurement framework for the peakedness of departure time distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persuasive scholarship presents how individual daily travel habits implicate congestion, environmental pollution, and the travel experience. However, the empirical characteristics and dynamics of travel habits remain poorly understood. Quantifying both our individual travel habits and how these habits aggregate to form system-wide dynamics is of critical importance to enable the smart design of public transit systems that are better tailored to our daily mobility needs. We contribute to this need through the development and implementation of a new measurement framework capturing the 'peakedness' of users' departure time distributions. Departure time 'peakedness' reflects a user's tendency to repeatedly choose the same departure time for a given origin-destination trip, offering a clearer and more intuitive representation of regularity and habitual patterns compared to traditional metrics like standard deviation or entropy. Our framework demonstrates that system-wide departure time peakedness can be decomposed into individual users' departure time peakedness and the alignment of their peak times. This allows for a systematic analysis of both individual and collective behaviours. We apply our framework to departure time data from a 12-month period, encompassing 5,947,907 bus journeys made by 29,640 individuals across three urban networks within a large regional metropolis. Our findings reveal that departure time peakedness is more deeply tied to inherent, passenger-specific characteristics, such as passenger type, rather than external factors like weather or holidays. Additionally, individual-level departure time peakedness shows notable dynamics over time, indicating that habitual routines can evolve in the long term, while system-level peakedness exhibits remarkable long-term stability.</description>
