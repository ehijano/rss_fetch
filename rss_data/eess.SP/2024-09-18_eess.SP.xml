      <title>An Ultra-Low Power Wearable BMI System with Continual Learning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the progress in efficient embedded processing, there is an accelerating trend toward running machine learning models directly on wearable Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) to improve portability and privacy and maximize battery life. However, achieving low latency and high classification performance remains challenging due to the inherent variability of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals across sessions and the limited onboard resources. This work proposes a comprehensive BMI workflow based on a CNN-based Continual Learning (CL) framework, allowing the system to adapt to inter-session changes. The workflow is deployed on a wearable, parallel ultra-low power BMI platform (BioGAP). Our results based on two in-house datasets, Dataset A and Dataset B, show that the CL workflow improves average accuracy by up to 30.36% and 10.17%, respectively. Furthermore, when implementing the continual learning on a Parallel Ultra-Low Power (PULP) microcontroller (GAP9), it achieves an energy consumption as low as 0.45mJ per inference and an adaptation time of only 21.5ms, yielding around 25h of battery life with a small 100mAh, 3.7V battery on BioGAP. Our setup, coupled with the compact CNN model and on-device CL capabilities, meets users' needs for improved privacy, reduced latency, and enhanced inter-session performance, offering good promise for smart embedded real-world BMIs.</description>

      <title>On the normalized signal to noise ratio in covariance estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the Normalized Signal to Noise Ratio (NSNR) metric defined in the seminal paper by Reed, Mallett and Brennan on adaptive detection. The setting is detection of a target vector in additive correlated noise. NSNR is the ratio between the SNR of a linear detector which uses an estimated noise covariance and the SNR of clairvoyant detector based on the exact unknown covariance. It is not obvious how to evaluate NSNR since it is a function of the target vector. To close this gap, we consider the NSNR associated with the worst target. Using the Kantorovich Inequality, we provide a closed form solution for the worst case NSNR. Then, we prove that the classical Gaussian Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence bounds it. Numerical experiments with different true covariances and various estimates also suggest that the KL metric is more correlated with the NSNR metric than competing norm based metrics.</description>

      <title>Channel Correlation Matrix Extrapolation Based on Roughness Calibration of Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To estimate the channel correlation matrix (CCM) in areas where channel information cannot be collected in advance, this paper proposes a way to spatially extrapolate CCM based on the calibration of the surface roughness parameters of scatterers in the propagation scene. We calibrate the roughness parameters of scene scatters based on CCM data in some specific areas. From these calibrated roughness parameters, we are able to generate a good prediction of the CCM for any other area in the scene by performing ray tracing. Simulation results show that the channel extrapolation method proposed in this paper can effectively realize the extrapolation of the CCM between different areas in frequency domain, or even from one domain to another.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Graph Signal Estimation among Multiple Sub-Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an estimation method for time-varying graph signals among multiple sub-networks. In many sensor networks, signals observed are associated with nodes (i.e., sensors), and edges of the network represent the inter-node connectivity. For a large sensor network, measuring signal values at all nodes over time requires huge resources, particularly in terms of energy consumption. To alleviate the issue, we consider a scenario that a sub-network, i.e., cluster, from the whole network is extracted and an intra-cluster analysis is performed based on the statistics in the cluster. The statistics are then utilized to estimate signal values in another cluster. This leads to the requirement for transferring a set of parameters of the sub-network to the others, while the numbers of nodes in the clusters are typically different. In this paper, we propose a cooperative Kalman filter between two sub-networks. The proposed method alternately estimates signals in time between two sub-networks. We formulate a state-space model in the source cluster and transfer it to the target cluster on the basis of optimal transport. In the signal estimation experiments of synthetic and real-world signals, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Linear Jamming Bandits: Learning to Jam 5G-based Coded Communications Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study jamming of an OFDM-modulated signal which employs forward error correction coding. We extend this to leverage reinforcement learning with a contextual bandit to jam a 5G-based system implementing some aspects of the 5G protocol. This model introduces unreliable reward feedback in the form of ACK/NACK observations to the jammer to understand the effect of how imperfect observations of errors can affect the jammer's ability to learn. We gain insights into the convergence time of the jammer and its ability to jam a victim 5G waveform, as well as insights into the vulnerabilities of wireless communications for reinforcement learning-based jamming.</description>

      <title>NirvaWave: An Accurate and Efficient Near Field Wave Propagation Simulator for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended near-field range in future mm-Wave and sub-THz wireless networks demands a precise and efficient near-field channel simulator for understanding and optimizing wireless communications in this less-explored regime. This paper presents NirvaWave, a novel near-field channel simulator, built on scalar diffraction theory and Fourier principles, to provide precise wave propagation response in complex wireless mediums under custom user-defined transmitted EM signals. NirvaWave offers an interface for investigating novel near-field wavefronts, e.g., Airy beams, Bessel beams, and the interaction of mmWave and sub-THz signals with obstructions, reflectors, and scatterers. The simulation run-time in NirvaWave is orders of magnitude lower than its EM software counterparts that directly solve Maxwell Equations. Hence, NirvaWave enables a user-friendly interface for large-scale channel simulations required for developing new model-driven and data-driven techniques. We evaluated the performance of NirvaWave through direct comparison with EM simulation software. Finally, we have open-sourced the core codebase of NirvaWave in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/vahidyazdnian1378/NirvaWave).</description>

      <title>Meijer-G Function with Continued Product and Integer Exponent: Performance of Multi-Aperture UOWC System over EGG Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal transmission over underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) experiences the combined effect of oceanic turbulence and pointing errors statistically modeled using the sum of two Meijer-G functions. There is a research gap in the exact statistical analysis of multi-aperture UOWC systems that use selection combining diversity techniques to enhance performance compared to single-aperture systems. In this paper, we develop a general framework for the continued product and positive integer exponent for the sum of Meijer-G functions to analyze the exact statistical performance of the UOWC system in terms of multivariate Fox-H function for both independent and non-identically distributed (i.ni.d.) and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channels. We also approximate the performance of a multi-aperture UOWC system with i.i.d. channels using the single-variate Fox-H function. Using the generalized approach, we present analytical expressions for average bit-error rate (BER) and ergodic capacity for the considered system operating over exponential generalized gamma (EGG) oceanic turbulence combined with zero-boresight pointing errors. We also develop asymptotic expressions for the average BER at a high signal-to-noise (SNR) to capture insights into the system's performance. Our simulation findings confirm the accuracy of our derived expressions and illustrate the impact of turbulence parameters for i.ni.d. and i.i.d. models for the average BER and ergodic capacity, which may provide a better estimate for the efficient deployment of UOWC.</description>

      <title>Proximal Gradient Dynamics: Monotonicity, Exponential Convergence, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the proximal gradient dynamics. This recently-proposed continuous-time dynamics solves optimization problems whose cost functions are separable into a nonsmooth convex and a smooth component. First, we show that the cost function decreases monotonically along the trajectories of the proximal gradient dynamics. We then introduce a new condition that guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function to its optimal value, and show that this condition implies the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. We also show that the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function. Moreover, we extend these results to time-varying optimization problems, providing bounds for equilibrium tracking. Finally, we discuss applications of these findings, including the LASSO problem, quadratic optimization with polytopic constraints, and certain matrix based problems.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Neural Fields for Adaptive Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality with wide medical applications. Conventional PACT image reconstruction algorithms suffer from wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue, which leads to image degradation. Accounting for these effects improves image quality, but measuring the SOS distribution is experimentally expensive. An alternative approach is to perform joint reconstruction of the initial pressure image and SOS using only the PA signals. Existing joint reconstruction methods come with limitations: high computational cost, inability to directly recover SOS, and reliance on inaccurate simplifying assumptions. Implicit neural representation, or neural fields, is an emerging technique in computer vision to learn an efficient and continuous representation of physical fields with a coordinate-based neural network. In this work, we introduce NF-APACT, an efficient self-supervised framework utilizing neural fields to estimate the SOS in service of an accurate and robust multi-channel deconvolution. Our method removes SOS aberrations an order of magnitude faster and more accurately than existing methods. We demonstrate the success of our method on a novel numerical phantom as well as an experimentally collected phantom and in vivo data. Our code and numerical phantom are available at https://github.com/Lukeli0425/NF-APACT.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA 2.0: Ambiguity-Free Scattering Matrix Estimation by Terminating Inaccessible Ports With Tunable and Coupled Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently introduced the "Virtual VNA" concept which estimates the $N \times N$ scattering matrix characterizing an arbitrarily complex linear system with $N$ monomodal ports by inputting and outputting waves only via $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while terminating the $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ remaining ports with known tunable individual loads. However, vexing ambiguities about the signs of the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports remained. If only phase-insensitive measurements were used, an additional blockwise phase ambiguity ensued. Here, inspired by the emergence of "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" in wireless communications, we lift all ambiguities with at most $N_\mathrm{S}$ additional measurements involving a known multi-port load network. We experimentally validate our approach based on an 8-port chaotic cavity, using a simple coaxial cable as two-port load network. Endowed with the multi-port load network, the "Virtual VNA 2.0" is now able to estimate the entire scattering matrix without any ambiguity, even without ever measuring phase information explicitly. Potential applications include the characterization of antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Single-stage TTS with Masked Audio Token Modeling and Semantic Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio token modeling has become a powerful framework for speech synthesis, with two-stage approaches employing semantic tokens remaining prevalent. In this paper, we aim to simplify this process by introducing a semantic knowledge distillation method that enables high-quality speech generation in a single stage. Our proposed model improves speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity compared to a single-stage baseline. Although two-stage systems still lead in intelligibility, our model significantly narrows the gap while delivering comparable speech quality. These findings showcase the potential of single-stage models to achieve efficient, high-quality TTS with a more compact and streamlined architecture.</description>

      <title>Geometry Aware Meta-Learning Neural Network for Joint Phase and Precoder Optimization in RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided systems, the joint optimization of the precoder matrix at the base station and the phase shifts of the RIS elements involves significant complexity. In this paper, we propose a complex-valued, geometry aware meta-learning neural network that maximizes the weighted sum rate in a multi-user multiple input single output system. By leveraging the complex circle geometry for phase shifts and spherical geometry for the precoder, the optimization occurs on Riemannian manifolds, leading to faster convergence. We use a complex-valued neural network for phase shifts and an Euler inspired update for the precoder network. Our approach outperforms existing neural network-based algorithms, offering higher weighted sum rates, lower power consumption, and significantly faster convergence. Specifically, it converges faster by nearly 100 epochs, with a 0.7 bps improvement in weighted sum rate and a 1.8 dBm power gain when compared with existing work.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex UWA communication with a two-element transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a full-duplex (FD) underwater acoustic (UWA) communication system simultaneously transmitting and receiving acoustic signals in the same frequency bandwidth. To simplify the FD hardware, the system exploits a recently designed two-element transducer capable of simultaneously transmitting and receiving signals. The key challenge of implementing an FD system is to cancel the strong self-interference (SI) from the near-end transmitter. By using advanced adaptive filtering algorithms providing high accuracy channel estimates, a high level of SI cancellation can be achieved when the far-end signal is absent. However, the SI channel estimation performance is limited in FD scenarios since the far-end signal acts as an interference. In this paper, we propose an FD UWA communication system which alternates between the SI cancellation and far-end data demodulation. An adaptive Rake combiner with multipath interference cancellation is implemented to improve the demodulation performance in time-varying multipath channels. The performance of the FD UWA system is evaluated in lake experiments. The proposed adaptive Rake combiner with multipath interference cancellation significantly outperforms the conventional Rake combiner in all the experiments. With the new Rake combiner, the detection performance of the proposed FD UWA system is comparable with that of the half-duplex system.</description>

Abstract: This letter studies an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled non-line-of-sight (NLoS) target detection system, in which an active IRS equipped with active reflecting elements and sensors is strategically deployed to facilitate target detection in the NLoS region of the base station (BS) by processing echo signals through the BS-IRS-target-IRS link. First, we design an optimal detector based on the Neyman-Pearson (NP) theorem and derive the corresponding detection probability. Intriguingly, it is demonstrated that the optimal detector can exploit both the BS's transmit signal and the active IRS's reflection noise for more effective detection. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the active IRS to maximize the detection probability, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint at the BS, as well as the maximum amplification power and gain constraints at the active IRS. Finally, simulation results unveil that the proposed joint beamforming design significantly enhances the detection probability, with the active IRS outperforming its fully- and semi-passive counterparts in detection performance.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security over Fluid Antenna Systems: Secrecy Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05722</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in fluid antenna-aided communication systems under arbitrary correlated fading channels. In particular, it is considered that a single fixed-antenna transmitter aims to send confidential information to a legitimate receiver equipped with a planar fluid antenna system (FAS), while an eavesdropper, also taking advantage of a planar FAS, attempts to decode the desired message. For this scenario, we first present analytical expressions of the equivalent channel distributions at the legitimate user and eavesdropper by using copula, so that the obtained analytical results are valid for any arbitrarily correlated fading distributions. Then, with the help of Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, we derive compact analytical expressions for the average secrecy capacity (ASC), the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) for the FAS wiretap channel. Moreover, for exemplary purposes, we also obtain the compact expression of ASC, SOP, and SEE by utilizing the Gaussian copula under correlated Rayleigh fading channels as a special case. Eventually, numerical results indicate that applying the fluid antenna with only one activated port to PLS can guarantee more secure and reliable transmission, when compared to traditional antenna systems (TAS) exploiting maximal ratio combining (MRC) and antenna selection (AS) under selection combining (SC).</description>

      <title>3D-Speaker-Toolkit: An Open-Source Toolkit for Multimodal Speaker Verification and Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce 3D-Speaker-Toolkit, an open-source toolkit for multimodal speaker verification and diarization, designed for meeting the needs of academic researchers and industrial practitioners. The 3D-Speaker-Toolkit adeptly leverages the combined strengths of acoustic, semantic, and visual data, seamlessly fusing these modalities to offer robust speaker recognition capabilities. The acoustic module extracts speaker embeddings from acoustic features, employing both fully-supervised and self-supervised learning approaches. The semantic module leverages advanced language models to comprehend the substance and context of spoken language, thereby augmenting the system's proficiency in distinguishing speakers through linguistic patterns. The visual module applies image processing technologies to scrutinize facial features, which bolsters the precision of speaker diarization in multi-speaker environments. Collectively, these modules empower the 3D-Speaker-Toolkit to achieve substantially improved accuracy and reliability in speaker-related tasks. With 3D-Speaker-Toolkit, we establish a new benchmark for multimodal speaker analysis. The toolkit also includes a handful of open-source state-of-the-art models and a large-scale dataset containing over 10,000 speakers. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/modelscope/3D-Speaker.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and non-hyperuniformity of zeros of Gaussian Weyl-Heisenberg Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study zero sets of twisted stationary Gaussian random functions on the complex plane, i.e., Gaussian random functions that are stochastically invariant under the action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group. This model includes translation invariant Gaussian entire functions (GEFs), and also many other non-analytic examples, in which case winding numbers around zeros can be either positive or negative. We investigate zero statistics both when zeros are weighted with their winding numbers (charged zero set) and when they are not (uncharged zero set). We show that the variance of the charged zero statistic always grows linearly with the radius of the observation disk (hyperuniformity). Importantly, this holds for functions with possibly non-zero means and without assuming additional symmetries such as radiality. With respect to uncharged zero statistics, we provide an example for which the variance grows with the area of the observation disk (non-hyperuniformity). This is used to show that, while the zeros of GEFs are hyperuniform, the set of their critical points fails to be so. Our work contributes to recent developments in statistical signal processing, where the time-frequency profile of a non-stationary signal embedded into noise is revealed by performing a statistical test on the zeros of its spectrogram (``silent points''). We show that empirical spectrogram zero counts enjoy moderate deviation from their ensemble averages over large observation windows (something that was previously known only for pure noise). In contrast, we also show that spectogram maxima (``loud points") fail to enjoy a similar property. This gives the first formal evidence for the statistical superiority of silent points over the competing feature of loud points, a fact that has been noted by practitioners.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where each access point (AP) serves all the users with the aid of the RIS. We practically model the system by considering imperfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and employing imperfect successive interference cancellation at the users end. We first obtain the channel estimates using linear minimum mean square error approach considering the spatial correlation at the RIS and then derive a closed-form downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expression using the statistical CSI. We next formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the sum SE of the system. We first introduce a novel successive Quadratic Transform (successive-QT) algorithm to optimize the transmit power coefficients using the concept of block optimization along with quadratic transform and then use the particle swarm optimization technique to design the RIS phase shifts. Note that most of the existing works on RIS-aided cell-free systems are specific instances of the general scenario studied in this work. We numerically show that i) the RIS-assisted link is more advantageous at lower transmit power regions where the direct link between AP and user is weak, ii) NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access schemes in terms of SE, and iii) the proposed joint optimization framework significantly improves the sum SE of the system.</description>

      <title>Laugh Now Cry Later: Controlling Time-Varying Emotional States of Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People change their tones of voice, often accompanied by nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter and cries, to convey rich emotions. However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the capability to generate speech with rich emotions, including NVs. This paper introduces EmoCtrl-TTS, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS that can generate highly emotional speech with NVs for any speaker. EmoCtrl-TTS leverages arousal and valence values, as well as laughter embeddings, to condition the flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS. To achieve high-quality emotional speech generation, EmoCtrl-TTS is trained using more than 27,000 hours of expressive data curated based on pseudo-labeling. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that EmoCtrl-TTS excels in mimicking the emotions of audio prompts in speech-to-speech translation scenarios. We also show that EmoCtrl-TTS can capture emotion changes, express strong emotions, and generate various NVs in zero-shot TTS. See https://aka.ms/emoctrl-tts for demo samples.</description>

      <title>CalTag: Robust calibration of mmWave Radar and LiDAR using backscatter tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of automation in robotics necessitates the use of high-quality perception systems, often through the use of multiple sensors. A crucial aspect of a successfully deployed multi-sensor system is the calibration with a known object typically named fiducial. In this work, we propose a novel fiducial system for millimeter wave radars, termed as CalTag. CalTag addresses the limitations of traditional corner reflector-based calibration methods in extremely cluttered environments. CalTag leverages millimeter wave backscatter technology to achieve more reliable calibration than corner reflectors, enhancing the overall performance of multi-sensor perception systems. We compare the performance in several real-world environments and show the improvement achieved by using CalTag as the radar fiducial over a corner reflector.</description>
