      <title>Johnson's determinantal identity for contiguous minors of Toeplitz matrices, with an accretive extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ real Toeplitz matrix satisfying $A+A^{\top}=2\mathbb J_n$, where $\mathbb J_n$ is the all-ones matrix.If $A_r(i,j)$ denotes the $r\times r$ contiguous submatrix of $A$ consisting of rows $i,i+1,\dots,i+r-1$ and columns $j,j+1,\dots,j+r-1$, then for every $n\ge 2$ one has $$\det A_{n-1}(1,2)+\det A_{n-1}(2,1)=2\det A_{n-1}(1,1).$$ This confirms a conjecture of Charles R.~Johnson (2003). The proof combines a rank-one determinant expansion with Dodgson's condensation formula, and then invokes a polynomial-identity argument in the Toeplitz parameters: after obtaining an equality of squares in the integral domain $\mathbb{Z}[b_1,\dots,b_{n-1}]$, we factor it to deduce an identity up to sign and determine the sign by a suitable specialization.We also give an extension of the Bayat--Teimoori arithmetic--geometric mean identity: for every real accretive matrix $A$, one has the sharp inequality $$
  \sqrt{\det A_{n-1}(1,1)\ \det A_{n-1}(2,2)}
  \ \ge\
  \left|\frac{\det A_{n-1}(1,2)+\det A_{n-1}(2,1)}{2}\right|,$$ with equality whenever the symmetric part has rank one, i.e.\ $A+A^{\top}=\alpha\,ww^{\top}$ for some $\alpha\in\mathbb R$ and $w\in\mathbb R^n\setminus\{0\}$,recovering the Bayat--Teimoori equality as a special case.</description>

      <title>Approximation by linear sampling operators in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies approximation properties of linear sampling operators in general Banach lattices $X$. We obtain matching direct and inverse approximation estimates, convergence criteria, equivalence results involving special $K$-functionals and their realizations by sampling operators, as well as strong converse inequalities, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously established for sampling operators even in the classical spaces $L_p$. The results extend several classical theorems previously known mainly in $L_p$ and apply to all functions $f\in X$ for which the corresponding sampling operator is well defined, thereby substantially enlarging the class of functions that can be considered in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the non-homogeneous abstract linear Schr\"odinger and wave equations with zero initial conditions, defined by operators of strip-type and parabola-type in Banach spaces, respectively, and establish the well-posedness of classical solutions in appropriate vector-valued Sobolev-Slobodetskii spaces. We obtain analogous results for two extensions of these equations by replacing the previously mentioned boundedness properties of the associated operators with $R$-boundedness. As an application, we consider an abstract semilinear wave equation and establish the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to this problem for short times.</description>

      <title>Composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces of the polydisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study composition operators between weighted Bergman spaces of the polydisc induced by smooth symbols. We prove a general result of continuity which only involves the behaviour of the symbol on the polytorus. We deduce from this several consequences about the automatic continuity of the induced operator. We study in depth the case of the tridisc and exhibit several examples showing that a characterization of continuity using only derivatives seems impossible.</description>

      <title>Equivalences between certain properties of weighted Lipschitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a weighted Lipschitz operator $\omega\widehat{f}$, certain linear properties are equivalent. Specifically, we prove that compactness, strict singularity, and strict cosingularity are all equivalent to the property of not fixing any complemented copy of $\ell^1$. Then we generalize this result to operators between Lipschitz-free spaces that preserve finitely supported elements, a larger class of operators.</description>

      <title>Weak compactness in nice Musielak-Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two weak compactness criteria in Musielak-Orlicz spaces for $N$-functions satisfying the $\Delta_2$-condition. They extend criteria from And\^o for Orlicz spaces to this setting of non-symmetrical Banach function spaces. As consequences, we prove criteria for a sequence in a Musielak-Orlicz space to be weakly convergent, and show that Musielak-Orlicz spaces with the subsequence splitting property are weakly Banach-Saks. The study includes the case of Musielak-Orlicz sequence spaces.</description>

      <title>Applications of Reproducing Kernels in composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we illustrate the effectiveness of reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques in the study of composition operators. For weighted Hardy spaces on the unit disk, we characterize the composition operators whose adjoint is again a composition operator. Using reproducing kernel methods, we obtain a classification of bounded weighted composition operators acting between reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We also show that the reproducing kernel techniques yield simpler proofs of several known results, highlighting the role of reproducing kernels as a unifying structural tool in the analysis of composition operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized Foguel-Hankel Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a more general class of Foguel-Hankel operators, where the unilateral shift on $\ell^2(\mathbb{N}) $ is replaced by a general multiplication operator on the Hardy space $H^2$ . We prove that Peller's condition is sufficient for the operator to be power bounded, but in general it is not necessary. When the Hankel matrix is the Hilbert matrix, we prove that being similar to a contraction is equivalent to the (a priori) weaker Kreiss condition.</description>

      <title>Additive and multiplicative maps in norm on the positive cone of continuous function algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact Hausdorff spaces. We denote by $C_0^+(X)$ the positive cone of all real-valued continuous functions on $X$ vanishing at infinity. In this paper, we consider a bijection $T\colon C_0^+(X) \to C_0^+(Y)$ satisfying the following two norm conditions for all $f, g \in C_0^+(X)$: \[
  \|T(f+g)\| = \|T(f)+T(g)\|,\qquad
  \|T(f \cdot g)\| = \|T(f) \cdot T(g)\|. \] The main result of this paper is that such a map $T$ is a composition operator of the form $T(f) = f \circ \tau$, induced by a homeomorphism $\tau\colon Y \to X$.</description>

      <title>A topology on the Fremlin tensor product between locally solid vector lattices with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ and $F$ be locally solid vector lattices. We introduce a locally solid topology on the Fremlin tensor product $E\overline{\otimes}F$ and we denote it by $\tau_{E\overline{\otimes}F}$. It extends the Fremlin projective tensor product in the setting of Banach lattices. The main purpose of the paper is to determine conditions under which, the canonical bilinear mapping \[E\times F\to (E\overline{\otimes}F,\tau_{E\overline{\otimes}F}),\hspace{0.50cm} (x,y)\mapsto x\otimes y,\] is uniformly continuous when $E$ and $F$ are equipped with appropriate unbounded convergences whose associated topologies make the corresponding spaces locally solid vector lattices. By means of an inequality for tensor products in vector lattices and by exploiting the structure of the topology $\tau_{E\overline{\otimes}F}$, we show, in particular, that
  the Fremlin tensor product between Banach lattices preserves several important classes of unbounded convergences.</description>

      <title>On weak*-basic sequences in duals and biduals of spaces C(X) and Quojections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for infinite Tychonoff spaces X and Y the weak*-dual of Ck(X x Y) contains a basic sequence; moreover, the weak*-bidual of Ck(X) contains such a sequence as well. When X and Y are infinite compact spaces, we single out a concrete sequence ({\mu}n) of finitely supported signed measures on X x Y with quantitative small-rectangle estimates, and we prove that every subsequence of ({\mu}n) admits a further subsequence which is strongly normal and forms a weak*-basic sequence in the dual C(X x Y)* of the Banach space C(X x Y). We also study the weak*-basic sequence problem for Frechet locally convex spaces in the class of quojections, and prove that for every quojection E the bidual E** admits a weak*-basic sequence, while a long-standing open problem asks whether the dual of every infinite-dimensional Banach space admits a basic sequence in the weak*-topology. Several examples and open questions are included, in particular for spaces C(X) and for inductive limits of Frechet spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Nachbin proximity on a bounded archimedean $\ell$-algebra (bal-algebra), and show that Gelfand duality lifts to yield a dual equivalence between the category of uniformly complete bal-algebras equipped with a closed Nachbin proximity and that of Nachbin spaces (compact ordered spaces). The key ingredients of the proof include appropriate generalizations of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem and Dieudonn\'{e}'s lemma. We also develop an alternate approach by means of bounded archimedean $\ell$-semialgebras (sbal-algebras), from which we derive De Rudder--Hansoul duality.</description>

      <title>Center Manifolds and Normal Forms for Nonlinearly Periodically Forced DDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an effective framework for analysing bifurcations of equilibria in nonlinearly periodically forced delay differential equations. First, we establish the existence of a periodic smooth finite-dimensional center manifold near a nonhyperbolic equilibrium using the rigorous functional analytic framework of dual semigroups (sun-star calculus). Second, we construct a center manifold parametrization that allows us to describe the local dynamics on the center manifold near the equilibrium in terms of periodically forced normal forms. Third, we present a normalization method to derive explicit computational formulas for the critical normal form coefficients at a bifurcation of interest. In particular, we obtain such formulas for the periodically forced fold and nonresonant Hopf bifurcation. Several examples and indications from the literature confirm the validity and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Closing the gap around the essential minimum of height functions with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many common height functions, the explicit determination of the essential minimum is an open problem. We consider a classical method to obtain lower bounds that goes back at least to C.J. Smyth, and a method to obtain upper bounds based on the knowledge of the limit distribution of integral points. We use an infinite dimensional linear programming scheme to show that that both methods agree in the limit, by showing that the principle of strong duality holds in our situation. As a corollary we prove that the essential minimum can be attained by sequences of algebraic integers.
  Recent results by A. Smith and B. Orloski--N. Sardari, furnish a characterization of compactly supported measures that can be approximated by complete sets of conjugates of algebraic integers, in terms of infinitely many nonnegativity conditions. We establish an extension of this characterization to measures with non necessarily compact support. As an application of this result and of strong duality, we show that the essential minimum is a computable real number when the Green function used to define the height is computable. We systematically use potential theory for measures that can integrate functions with logarithmic growth.</description>

Abstract: We obtain an improved lower bound for the restricted reverse weak-type estimate of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $M$. This result is applied to the $\lambda$-median maximal operator $m_{\lambda}$ acting on a Banach function space $X$. We show that under certain assumptions on $X$, the boundedness properties of $m_{\lambda}$ and $M$ are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Remarks on well-posedness for linear elliptic equations via divergence-free transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of linear elliptic equations, focusing on the divergence-free transformation introduced in the author's recent work [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 548 (2025), 129425]. By comparing this approach with classical bilinear form methods, we demonstrate that while standard techniques encounter limitations in handling zero-order coefficients $c \in L^1(U)$, the divergence-free transformation successfully establishes well-posedness in this setting. Furthermore, utilizing the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem between the cases $c \in L^1(U)$ and $c \in L^{\frac{2d}{d+2}}(U)$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions under the assumption $c \in L^s(U)$ for $s \in [1, \frac{2d}{d+2}]$.</description>

Abstract: This paper assumes a robust stochastic model where a set $\mathcal{P}$ of probability measures replaces the single probability measure of dominated models. We introduce and study $\mathcal{P}$-sensitive functions defined on robust function spaces of random variables. We show that $\mathcal{P}$-sensitive functions are precisely those that admit a representation via so-called functional localization. The theory is applied to solving robust optimization problems, to convex risk measures, and to the study of no arbitrage in robust one-period financial models.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for non-trace class noise and applications to SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of stochastic PDEs with colored, non-trace class space-time noise, one frequently encounters Gaussian series of the form $$ \sum_{n\geq 1} \gamma_n \mu_n f_n, $$ where $(\gamma_n)_{n}$ is a sequence of standard independent Gaussian variables, $g$ is an $L^\eta(\mathcal{O})$ function, $(\mu_n)_{n}$ is a sequence of scalars, and $(f_n)_n$ is an orthonormal system in $L^2(\mathcal{O})$ where $\mathcal{O} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is an open set. In this manuscript, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the above sum to converge in Bessel potential spaces $H^{-s,q}(\mathcal{O})$. The latter can be interpreted as a Sobolev embedding for Gaussian series. Our main theorem is formulated using weighted sequence spaces that encode the $L^\infty$-growth of the orthonormal system $(f_n)_{n}$, a feature that is crucial for obtaining sharp estimates. We apply our results to the stochastic heat equation with additive non-trace class noise. In this case, our conditions capture the scaling relationship between the heat operator and the coloring of the noise.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of composition operators induced by odometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear dynamics of composition operators induced by measurable transformations on finite measure spaces, with particular emphasis on operators induced by odometers. Our first main result shows that, on a finite measure space, supercyclicity of a composition operator implies hypercyclicity. This phenomenon has no analogue in several classical settings and highlights a rigidity specific to the finite-measure context.
  We then focus on composition operators induced by odometers and show that many dynamical properties that are distinct for weighted backward shifts collapse in this setting. In particular, for such operators, supercyclicity, Li-Yorke chaos, hypercyclicity, weak mixing, and Devaney chaos are all equivalent.
  In contrast to this collapse, we show that the classical equivalence between Devaney chaos and the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion for weighted backward shifts fails for odometers. Specifically, we construct a mixing, chaotic, and distributionally chaotic composition operator that does not satisfy the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion. This combination of rigidity and separation demonstrates that the dynamical behavior of composition operators induced by odometers differs sharply from that of weighted backward shifts.</description>

      <title>Pureness and stable rank one for reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of certain group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove two results. First, we observe that discrete groups with property $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PHP}}$ in the sense of Ozawa give rise to completely selfless reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras, thereby extending a theorem of Ozawa from the untwisted to the twisted case. Second, we show that reduced (twisted) $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of some group extensions of the form finite-by-$G$, with $G$ having the property $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PHP}}$, have stable rank one and are pure, which implies strict comparison. Our results do not assume rapid decay, and extend a theorem of Raum-Thiel-Vilalta. Examples covered by our results include reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of all acylindrically hyperbolic groups and all lattices in ${\rm SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ for $n\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Non-negative polynomials on generalized elliptic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cone of non-negative polynomials on generalized elliptic curves. We show that the zero set of every extreme ray has dense real points. If a generalized elliptic curve is embedded via a complete linear system, then we show that the convex hull of its real points (taken inside any affine chart containing all real points) is a spectrahedron. On the way, we generalize a result by Geyer--Martens on 2-torsion points in the Picard group of smooth real curves (of arbitrary genus) to possibly singular and reducible ones.</description>

      <title>Large Coupling Convergence Beyond Definiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study convergence of operator families of the form $A_\beta = A + \beta B$ towards an effective operator defined on $\ker(B)$, as the coupling constant $\beta$ tends to infinity. Crucially, we focus on the setting where neither $A$ nor $B$ can be assumed to be positive- (or negative-) semi-definite. We are hence outside the classical form-theoretic framework, where results based on Kato's monotone convergence theorem would be applicable. Thus, instead of form methods, our approach builds on classical resolvent identities to study convergence of the family $\{A_\beta\}_{\beta}$. Our findings are that: (i) \emph{Strong} resolvent convergence holds (without further spectral assumptions) if $A + \beta B$ is self-adjoint and the compression of $A$ onto $\ker(B)$ is well behaved. (ii) Under the more detailed assumption that $0 \in \sigma(B)$ is isolated, \emph{norm} resolvent convergence can be established even if $A+\beta B$ is merely closed, provided the quasinilpotent part of $B$ at zero vanishes and certain conditions on the interplay of $A$ and $B$ are met. Importantly, if $B$ is not self-adjoint we find that the limit operator not only depends on $\ker(B)$ as a Hilbert space, but crucially also on the precise form of the Riesz projector at $0 \in \sigma(B)$ onto $\ker(B)$.</description>

      <title>Di-Graphs with tightly connected Clusters: Effective Graph Laplacians and Resolvent Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study Laplacians on graphs for which connectivity within certain subgraphs tends to infinity. Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from aggregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.</description>
