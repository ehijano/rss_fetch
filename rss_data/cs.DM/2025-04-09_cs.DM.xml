      <title>Broadcast via Mobile Agents in a Dynamic Network: Interplay of Graph Properties &amp; Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of \textsc{Broadcast}, introduced by Das, Giachoudis, Luccio, and Markou [OPODIS, 2020], where $k+1$ agents are initially placed on an $n$ node dynamic graph, where $1$ agent has a message that must be broadcast to the remaining $k$ ignorant agents. The original paper studied the relationship between the number of agents needed to solve the problem and the edge density of the graph. The paper presented strong evidence that edge density of a graph, or the number of redundant edges within the graph, may be the correct graph property to accurately differentiate whether $k= o(n)$ agents (low edge density) or $k = \Omega(n)$ agents (high edge density) are needed to solve the problem.
  In this paper, we show that surprisingly, edge density may not in fact be the correct differentiating property. The original paper presents graphs with edge density $1.1\overline{6}$ that require $\Omega(n)$ agents, however, we construct graphs with edge density $&gt; 1.1\overline{6}$ and develop an algorithm to solve the problem on those graphs using only $o(n)$ agents. We subsequently show that the relationship between edge density and number of agents is fairly weak by first constructing graphs with edge density tending to $1$ from above that require $\Omega(n/f(n))$ agents to solve, for any function $f(n) \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$. We then construct an infinite family of graphs with edge density $&lt; \rho$ requiring exactly $k$ ignorant agents to solve \textsc{Broadcast}, for any $k&gt;0$ and $\rho&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bounded Hop-Spanners for Geometric Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new results on $2$- and $3$-hop spanners for geometric intersection graphs. These include improved upper and lower bounds for $2$- and $3$-hop spanners for many geometric intersection graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For example, we show that the intersection graph of $n$ balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $2$-hop spanner of size $O^*\left(n^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2(2\lfloor d/2\rfloor +1)}}\right)$ and the intersection graph of $n$ fat axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $2$-hop spanner of size $O(n \log^{d+1}n)$.
  Furthermore, we show that the intersection graph of general semi-algebraic objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $3$-hop spanner of size $O^*\left(n^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2(2D-1)}}\right)$, where $D$ is a parameter associated with the description complexity of the objects. For such families (or more specifically, for tetrahedra in $\mathbb{R}^3$), we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\frac{4}{3}})$. For $3$-hop and axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we provide the upper bound $O(n \log ^{d-1}n)$ and lower bound $\Omega\left(n (\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})^{d-2}\right)$.</description>

      <title>A Method for Generating Connected Erdos-Renyi Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n, p)$. Our approach exploits a link between the distribution of exploration process trajectories and an inhomogeneous random walk. In contrast to existing methods, our approach guarantees the correct distribution under the connectivity condition and achieves $O(n^2)$ runtime in the sparse case $p = c/n$. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to uniformly generate connected graphs $G(n, m)$ via an acceptance-rejection procedure.</description>

      <title>Totally equimodular matrices: decomposition and triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Totally equimodular matrices generalize totally unimodular matrices and arise in the context of box-total dual integral polyhedra. This work further explores the parallels between these two classes and introduces foundational building blocks for constructing totally equimodular matrices. Consequently, we present a decomposition theorem for totally equimodular matrices of full row rank.
  Building on this decomposition theorem, we prove that simplicial cones whose generators form the rows of a totally equimodular matrix sa\-tisfy strong integrality decomposition properties. More precisely, we provide the Hilbert basis for these cones and construct regular unimodular Hilbert triangulations in most cases. We conjecture that cases not covered here do not exist.</description>

      <title>Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.</description>

      <title>Trail Trap: a variant of Partizan Edge Geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-player game played on undirected graphs called {\sc Trail Trap}, which is a variant of a game known as {\sc Partizan Edge Geography}. One player starts by choosing any edge and moving a token from one endpoint to the other; the other player then chooses a different edge and does the same. Alternating turns, each player moves their token along an unused edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex, until one player cannot move and loses. We present an algorithm to determine which player has a winning strategy when the graph is a tree and partially characterize the trees on which a given player wins. Additionally, we show that it is NP-hard to determine if Player~2 has a winning strategy on {\sc Trail Trap}, even for connected bipartite planar graphs with maximum degree $4$. We determine which player has a winning strategy for certain subclasses of complete bipartite graphs and grid graphs, and we propose several open problems for further study.</description>

      <title>An explicit condition for boundedly supermultiplicative subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study some properties of the growth rate of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$, that is, the language of words over the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ avoiding the set of forbidden factors $\mathcal{F}$. We first provide a sufficient condition on $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ for the growth of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ to be boundedly supermultiplicative. That is, there exist constants $C&gt;0$ and $\alpha\ge0$, such that for all $n$, the number of words of length $n$ in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ is between $\alpha^n$ and $C\alpha^n$. In some settings, our condition provides a way to compute $C$, which implies that $\alpha$, the growth rate of the language, is also computable whenever our condition holds.
  We also apply our technique to the specific setting of power-free words where the argument can be slightly refined to provide better bounds. Finally, we apply a similar idea to $\mathcal{F}$-free circular words and in particular we make progress toward a conjecture of Shur about the number of square-free circular words.</description>
