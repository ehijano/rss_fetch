      <title>Stratosphere Model Verification with Manufactured Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an exact solution for a stratosphere dynamical core formulated in geopotential/pressure coordinates with a time-evolving lower boundary supplied by the troposphere. Rather than constraining the stratospheric circulation via specified dynamics (``nudging'') to a reanalysis, we treat the tropopause as a moving geometric boundary. The stratospheric domain thus expands, contracts, and undulates in response to tropospheric variability while preserving familiar hybrid $\sigma$--$p$ structure and pressure-gradient calculations. The approach integrates naturally with arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian (ALE) updates and conservative remap to maintain positive layer thickness and tracer monotonicity. We outline the formulation, highlight analytical properties (well-posedness, energetics, wave propagation), and sketch a verification/validation path based on modified standard test cases and reanalysis-driven experiments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for re-analysis and calibration of extreme sea state events simulated with a spectral third-generation wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate hindcasting of extreme sea state events is essential for coastal engineering, risk assessment, and climate studies. However, the reliability of numerical wave models remains limited by uncertainties in physical parameterizations and model inputs. This study presents a novel calibration framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO), leveraging the Tree structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to efficiently estimate uncertain sink term parameters, specifically bottom friction dissipation, depth induced breaking, and wave dissipation from strong opposing currents, in the ANEMOC-3 hindcast wave model. The proposed method enables joint optimization of continuous parameters and discrete model structures, significantly reducing discrepancies between model outputs and observations. Applied to a one month period encompassing multiple intense storm events along the French Atlantic coast, the calibrated model demonstrates improved agreement with buoy measurements, achieving lower bias, RMSE, and scatter index relative to the default sea$-$state solver configuration. The results highlight the potential of BO to automate and enhance wave model calibration, offering a scalable and flexible approach applicable to a wide range of geophysical modeling problems. Future extensions include multi-objective optimization, uncertainty quantification, and integration of additional observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Turbulence is ineffective in causing raindrop growth in polluted clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosol-cloud interactions represent the largest uncertainty in climate-change assessment, and while cloud turbulence is considered crucial for droplet growth, its precise role remains unclear. Our laboratory-controlled studies show that turbulence does not always enhance collision and coalescence; instead, its influence emerges only when droplets have a sufficiently broad size distribution. The dissipative-scale droplet behaviour underscores the importance of improved parameterisations to accurately model cloud microphysics.</description>

      <title>A Topological Framework for Atmospheric River Interaction Using Framed Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are filamentary moisture pathways responsible for a large fraction of extreme precipitation and often occur as interacting filament bundles within the same synoptic regime. Existing diagnostics typically analyze ARs in isolation, despite the frequent coexistence and interaction of multiple filaments. We introduce a topological framework for AR analysis based on framed braids and framed braidoids, which encodes both the geometric interaction of AR centroids and the internal evolution of moisture transport.
  In this approach, AR filaments are represented as strands whose time-ordered crossings form braid words, while moisture-based framing captures internal intensification or weakening along each filament. Applying this framework to reanalysis-derived Atmospheric River track data, we construct braid and framed braid representations over sliding time windows and analyze a strongly interacting multi-filament AR episode in the North Pacific. The results show that braid-based indicators capture structural reorganizations and moisture intensification episodes that are not apparent from centroid geometry or IVT magnitude alone, offering a complementary structural perspective on atmospheric moisture transport.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Detection and Uncertainty Visualization of Atmospheric Blocking Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric blocking events are quasi-stationary high-pressure systems that disrupt the typical paths of polar and subtropical air currents, often producing prolonged extreme weather events such as summer heat waves or winter cold spells. Despite their critical role in shaping mid-latitude weather, accurately modeling and analyzing blocking events in long meteorological records remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we present an uncertainty visualization framework for detecting and characterizing atmospheric blocking events. First, we introduce a geometry-based detection and tracking method, evaluated on both pre-industrial climate model simulations (UKESM) and reanalysis data (ERA5), which represent historical Earth observations assimilated from satellite and station measurements onto regular numerical grids using weather models. Second, we propose a suite of uncertainty-aware summaries: contour boxplots that capture representative boundaries and their variability, frequency heatmaps that encode occurrences, and 3D temporal stacks that situate these patterns in time. Third, we demonstrate our framework in a case study of the 2003 European heatwave, mapping the spatiotemporal occurrences of blocking events using these summaries. Collectively, these uncertainty visualizations reveal where blocking events are most likely to occur and how their spatial footprints evolve over time. We envision our framework as a valuable tool for climate scientists and meteorologists: by analyzing how blocking frequency, duration, and intensity vary across regions and climate scenarios, it supports both the study of historical blocking events and the assessment of scenario-dependent climate risks associated with changes in extreme weather linked to blocking.</description>

      <title>An Analytical and AI-discovered Stable, Accurate, and Generalizable Subgrid-scale Closure for Geophysical Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.</description>
