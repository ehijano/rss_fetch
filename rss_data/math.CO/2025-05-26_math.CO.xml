      <title>On the distinguishing chromatic number in hereditary graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinguishing chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi_D(G)$, is the minimum number of colours in a proper vertex colouring of $G$ that is preserved by the identity automorphism only. Collins and Trenk proved that $\chi_D(G)\le 2\Delta(G)$ for any connected graph $G$, and the equality holds for complete balanced bipartite graphs $K_{p,p}$ and for $C_6$. In this paper, we show that the upper bound on $\chi_D(G)$ can be substantially reduced if we forbid some small graphs as induced subgraphs of $G$, that is, we study the distinguishing chromatic number in some hereditary graph classes.</description>

      <title>Uniform Tur\'an density -- palette classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17325v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os initiated the study of Tur\'an hypergraph problems with a uniformity condition on the distribution of edges, i.e., determining density thresholds for the existence of a hypergraph H in a host hypergraph with edges uniformly distributed. In particular, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os asked to determine the uniform Tur\'an densities of the hypergraphs $K_4^{(3)-}$ and $K_4^{(3)}$. After more than 30 years, the former was solved by Glebov, Kr\'al' and Volec [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349-366] and Reiher, R\"odl and Schacht [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139-1159], while the latter still remains open. In these two cases and several additional cases, the tight lower bounds are provided by a so-called palette construction.
  Lamaison [arXiv:2408.09643] has recently showed that the uniform Tur\'an density of a 3-uniform hypergraph H is equal to the supremum of the densities of palettes that H is not colorable with. We give a necessary and sufficient condition, which is easy to verify, on the existence of a 3-uniform hypergraph colorable by a set of palettes and not colorable by another given set of palettes. We also demonstrate how our result can be used to prove the existence of 3-uniform hypergraphs with specific values of the uniform Tur\'an density.</description>

      <title>S-packing chromatic critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing sequence of positive integers $S=(s_1,s_2,\ldots)$, the $S$-packing chromatic number of a graph $G$ is denoted by $\chi_S(G)$. In this paper, $\chi_S$-critical graphs are introduced as the graphs $G$ such that $\chi_S(H) &lt; \chi_S(G)$ for each proper subgraph $H$ of $G$. Several families of $\chi_S$-critical graphs are constructed, and $2$- and $3$-colorable $\chi_S$-critical graphs are presented for all packing sequences $S$, while $4$-colorable $\chi_S$-critical graphs are found for most of $S$. Cycles which are $\chi_S$-critical are characterized under different conditions. It is proved that for any graph $G$ and any edge $e \in E(G)$, the inequality $\chi_S(G - e) \ge \chi_S(G)/2$ holds. Moreover, in several important cases, this bound can be improved to $\chi_S(G - e) \ge (\chi_S(G)+1)/2$. The sharpness of the bounds is also discussed. Along the way an earlier result on $\chi_S$-vertex-critical graphs is supplemented.</description>

      <title>Partition of Sparse Multigraphs into a Forest and a Forest with Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following measure of sparsity of multigraphs refining the maximum average degree: For $a&gt;0$ and an arbitrary real $b$, a multigraph $H$ is \emph{$(a,b)$-sparse} if it is loopless and for every $A\subseteq V(H)$ with $|A|\geq 2$, the induced subgraph $H[A]$ has at most $a|A|+b$ edges. Forests are exactly $(1,-1)$-sparse multigraphs. It is known that the vertex set of any $(2,-1)$-sparse multigraph can be partitioned into two parts each of which induces a forest.
  For a given parameter $D$ we study for which pairs $(a,b)$ every $(a,b)$-sparse multigraph $G$ admits a vertex partition $(V_1, V_2)$ of $V(G)$ such that $G[V_1]$ and $G[V_2]$ are forests, and in addition either (i) $\Delta(G[V_1])\leq D$ or (ii) every component of $G[V_1]$ has at most $D$ edges. We find exact bounds on $a$ and $b$ for both types of problems (i) and (ii). We also consider problems of type (i) in the class of simple graphs and find exact bounds for all $D\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Independence numbers of the 2-token graphs of some join graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $2$-token graph $F_2(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose set of vertices consists of all the $2$-subsets of $V(G)$, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if their symmetric difference is an edge in $G$. Let $G$ be the join graph of $E_n$ and $H$, where $H$ is any graph. In this paper, we give a method to construct an independent set ${\mathcal I}'$ of $F_2(G)$ from an independent set ${\mathcal I}$ of $F_2(G)$ such that $|{\mathcal I}'| \geq |{\mathcal I}|$. As an application, we obtain the independence number of the $2$-token graphs of fan graphs $F_{n, m}$, wheel graphs $W_{n, m}$ and $E_n+K_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To each nodal hypersurface one can associate a binary linear code. Here we show that the binary linear code associated to sextics in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with the maximum number of $65$ nodes, as e.g. the Barth sextic, is unique. We also state possible candidates for codes that might be associated with a hypothetical septic attaining the currently best known upper bound for the maximum number of nodes.</description>

      <title>Cubic graphs of colouring defect 3 and conjectures of Berge and Alon-Tarsi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two measures of uncolourability of cubic graphs, their colouring defect and perfect matching index. The colouring defect of a cubic graph $G$ is the smallest number of edges left uncovered by three perfect matchings; the perfect matching index of $G$ is the smallest number of perfect matchings that together cover all edges of $G$. We provide a complete characterisation of cubic graphs with colouring defect $3$ whose perfect matching index is greater or equal to $5$. The result states that every such graph arises from the Petersen graph with a fixed $6$-cycle $C$ by substituting edges or vertices outside $C$ with suitable $3$-edge-colourable cubic graphs. Our research is motivated by two deep and long-standing conjectures, Berge's conjecture stating that five perfect matchings are enough to cover the edges of any bridgeless cubic graph and the shortest cycle cover conjecture of Alon and Tarsi suggesting that every bridgeless graph can have its edges covered with cycles of total length at most $7/5\cdot m$, where $m$ is the number of edges. We apply our characterisation to showing that every cubic graph with colouring defect $3$ admits a cycle cover of length at most $4/3\cdot m +1$, where $m$ is the number of edges, the bound being achieved by the graphs whose perfect matching index equals $5$. We further prove that every snark containing a $5$-cycle with an edge whose endvertices removed yield a $3$-edge-colourable graph has a cycle cover of length at most $4/3\cdot m+1$, as well.</description>

      <title>Paired domination in trees: A linear algorithm and asymptotic normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a paired dominating set if every vertex of $G$ is adjacent to a vertex in $S$ and the subgraph induced by $S$ contains a perfect matching (not necessarily as an induced subgraph). The paired domination number, $\gamma_{\mathrm{pr}}(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a paired dominating set of $G$. We present a linear algorithm for computing the paired domination number of a tree. As an application of our algorithm, we prove that the paired domination number is asymptotically normal in a random rooted tree of order $n$ generated by a conditioned Galton-Watson process as $n\to\infty$. In particular, we have found that the paired domination number of a random Cayley tree of order $n$, where each tree is equally likely, is asymptotically normal with expectation approaching $(0.5177\ldots)n$.</description>

      <title>Positive codegree thresholds for perfect matchings in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give, for each $k \geq 3$, the precise best possible minimum positive codegree condition for a perfect matching in a large $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $n$ vertices. Specifically we show that, if $n$ is sufficiently large and divisible by $k$, and $H$ has minimum positive codegree $\delta^+(H) \geq \frac{k-1}{k}n - (k-2)$ and no isolated vertices, then $H$ contains a perfect matching. For $k=3$ this was previously established by Halfpap and Magnan, who also gave bounds for $k \geq 4$ which were tight up to an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Finding d-Cuts in Claw-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Matching Cut problem is to decide if the vertex set of a connected graph can be partitioned into two non-empty sets $B$ and $R$ such that the edges between $B$ and $R$ form a matching, that is, every vertex in $B$ has at most one neighbour in $R$, and vice versa. If for some integer $d\geq 1$, we allow every neighbour in $B$ to have at most $d$ neighbours in $R$, and vice versa, we obtain the more general problem $d$-Cut. It is known that $d$-Cut is NP-complete for every $d\geq 1$. However, for claw-free graphs, it is only known that $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for $d=1$ and NP-complete for $d\geq 3$. We resolve the missing case $d=2$ by proving NP-completeness. This follows from our more general study, in which we also bound the maximum degree. That is, we prove that for every $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut, restricted to claw-free graphs of maximum degree $p$, is constant-time solvable if $p\leq 2d+1$ and NP-complete if $p\geq 2d+3$. Moreover, in the former case, we can find a $d$-cut in linear time. We also show how our positive results for claw-free graphs can be generalized to $S_{1^t,l}$-free graphs where $S_{1^t,l}$ is the graph obtained from a star on $t+2$ vertices by subdividing one of its edges exactly $l$ times.</description>

      <title>Advancing Uncertain Combinatorics through Graphization, Hyperization, and Uncertainization: Fuzzy, Neutrosophic, Soft, Rough, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To better handle real-world uncertainty, concepts such as fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, and soft sets have been introduced. For example, neutrosophic sets, which simultaneously represent truth, indeterminacy, and falsehood, have proven to be valuable tools for modeling uncertainty in complex systems. These set concepts are increasingly studied in graphized forms, and generalized graph concepts now encompass well-known structures such as hypergraphs and superhypergraphs. Furthermore, hyperconcepts and superhyperconcepts are being actively researched in areas beyond graph theory.
  Combinatorics, uncertain sets (including fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, soft sets, and plithogenic sets), uncertain graphs, and hyper and superhyper concepts are active areas of research with significant mathematical and practical implications. Recognizing their importance, this paper explores new graph and set concepts, as well as hyper and superhyper concepts, as detailed in the "Results" section of "The Structure of the Paper." Additionally, this work aims to consolidate recent findings, providing a survey-like resource to inform and engage readers.
  For instance, we extend several graph concepts by introducing Neutrosophic Oversets, Neutrosophic Undersets, Neutrosophic Offsets, and the Nonstandard Real Set. This paper defines a variety of concepts with the goal of inspiring new ideas and serving as a valuable resource for researchers in their academic pursuits.</description>

      <title>Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems work with taking maximization, minimization, and classical addition in their recursion algorithms. The associated value functions correspond to convex polyhedra in the max plus semiring. Existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning models, however, rely on softmax-normalized dot-product attention where the smooth exponential weighting blurs these sharp polyhedral structures and collapses when evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We introduce Tropical attention, a novel attention function that operates natively in the max-plus semiring of tropical geometry. We prove that Tropical attention can approximate tropical circuits of DP-type combinatorial algorithms. We then propose that using Tropical transformers enhances empirical OOD performance in both length generalization and value generalization, on algorithmic reasoning tasks, surpassing softmax baselines while remaining stable under adversarial attacks. We also present adversarial-attack generalization as a third axis for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that Tropical attention restores the sharp, scale-invariant reasoning absent from softmax.</description>

      <title>Polynomial progressions in the generalized twin primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By Maynard's theorem and the subsequent improvements by the Polymath Project, there exists a positive integer $b\leq 246$ such that there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p+b$ is also prime. Let $P_1,...,P_t\in \mathbb{Z}[y]$ with $P_1(0)=\cdots=P_t(0)=0$. We use the transference argument of Tao and Ziegler to prove there exist positive integers $x, y,$ and $b \leq 246 $ such that $x+P_1(y),x+P_2(y),...,x+P_t(y)$ and $x+P_1(y)+b,x+P_2(y)+b,...,x+P_t(y)+b$ are all prime. Our work is inspired by Pintz, who proved a similar result for the special case of arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a uniform approach to tackle problems about squarefree monomial ideals whose powers have good properties. We employ this approach to achieve a twofold goal: (i) recover and extend several well--known results in the literature, especially regarding Stanley--Reisner ideals of matroids, and (ii) provide short, elementary proofs for these results. Among them, we provide simple proofs of two celebrated results of Minh and Trung, Varbaro, and Terai and Trung elegantly characterizing the Cohen-Macaulay property, or even Serre's condition $(S_2)$, of symbolic and ordinary powers of squarefree monomial ideals in terms of their combinatorial (matroidal) structure. Our work relies on the interplay of several combinatorial and algebraic concepts, including dualities, polarizations, Serre's conditions, matroids, Hochster-Huneke graphs, vertex decomposability, and careful choices of monomial orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be any prime. We determine precisely those irreducible characters of symmetric groups which contain at most $p$ distinct linear constituents in their restriction to a Sylow $p$-subgroup, answering a question of Giannelli and Navarro. Moreover, we identify all of the linear constituents of such characters, and in the case $p = 2$ explicitly calculate a new class of Sylow branching coefficients for symmetric groups indexed by so-called almost hook partitions.</description>

      <title>On the geometric $k$-colored crossing number of $K_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the \emph{geometric $k$-colored crossing number} of complete graphs $\overline{\overline{\text{cr}}}_k(K_n)$, which is the smallest number of monochromatic crossings in any $k$-edge colored straight-line drawing of $K_n$.
  We substantially improve asymptotic upper bounds on $\overline{\overline{\text{cr}}}_k(K_n)$ for $k=2,\ldots, 10$ by developing a procedure for general $k$ that derives $k$-edge colored drawings of $K_n$ for arbitrarily large $n$ from initial drawings with a low number of monochromatic crossings.
  We obtain the latter by heuristic search, employing a \textsc{MAX-$k$-CUT}-formulation of a subproblem in the process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07467v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutations are usually enumerated by size, but new results can be found by enumerating them by inversions instead, in which case one must restrict one's attention to indecomposable permutations. In the style of the seminal paper by Simion and Schmidt, we investigate all combinations of permutation patterns of length at most 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the optimal parameters of additive quaternary codes of dimension $k\le 3$ have been determined there is some recent activity to settle the next case of dimension $k=3.5$. Here we complete dimension $k=3.5$ and give partial results for dimension $k=4$. We also solve the problem of the optimal parameters of additive quaternary codes of arbitrary dimension when assuming a sufficiently large minimum distance.</description>

      <title>10-list Recoloring of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a planar graph $G$ and a list-assignment $L$ with $|L(v)|=10$ for all $v\in V(G)$. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be $L$-colorings of $G$. A recoloring sequence from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ is a sequence of $L$-colorings, beginning with $\alpha$ and ending with $\beta$, such that each successive pair in the sequence differs in the color on a single vertex of $G$. We show that there exists a constant $C$ such that for all choices of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ there exists a recoloring sequence $\sigma$ from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ that recolors each vertex at most $C$ times. In particular, $\sigma$ has length at most $C|V(G)|$. This confirms a conjecture of Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Feghali. For our proof, we introduce a new technique for quickly showing that many configurations are reducible. We believe this method may be of independent interest and will have application to other problems in this area.</description>

      <title>A result for hemi-bundled cross-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called cross-intersecting if for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$, the intersection $F\cap G$ is non-empty. It is significant to determine the maximum sum of sizes of cross-intersecting families under the additional assumption that one of the two families is intersecting. Such a pair of families is said to be hemi-bundled. In particular, Frankl (2016) proved that for $k \geq 1, t\ge 0$ and $n \geq 2 k+t$, if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, in which $\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty and $(t+1)$-intersecting, then $|\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. This bound can be attained when $\mathcal{F}$ consists of a single set. In this paper, we generalize this result under the constraint $|\mathcal{F}| \geq r$ for every $r\leq n-k-t+1$. Moreover, we investigate the stability results of Katona's theorem for non-uniform families with the $s$-union property. Our result extends the stabilities established by Frankl (2017) and Li and Wu (2024). As applications, we revisit a recent result of Frankl and Wang (2024) as well as a result of Kupavskii (2018). Furthermore, we determine the extremal families in these two results.</description>

      <title>Identification of a monotone Boolean function with $k$ "reasons" as a combinatorial search problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the number of queries needed to identify a monotone Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$. A query consists of a 0-1-sequence, and the answer is the value of $f$ on that sequence. It is well-known that the number of queries needed is $\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}+\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1}$ in general. Here we study a variant where $f$ has $k$ ``reasons'' to be 1, i.e., its disjunctive normal form has $k$ conjunctions if the redundant conjunctions are deleted. This problem is equivalent to identifying an upfamily in $2^{[n]}$ that has exactly $k$ minimal members. We find the asymptotics on the number of queries needed for fixed $k$. We also study the non-adaptive version of the problem, where the queries are asked at the same time, and determine the exact number of queries for most values of $k$ and $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chorded cycle in a graph $G$ is a cycle on which two nonadjacent vertices are adjacent in the graph $G$. In 2010, Gao and Qiao independently proved a graph of order at least $4s$, in which the neighborhood union of any two nonadjacent vertices has at least $4s+1$ vertices, contains $s$ vertex-disjoint chorded cycles. In 2022, Gould raised a problem that asks whether increasing connectivity would improve the neighborhood union condition. In this paper, we solve the problem for $2$-connected graphs by
  proving that a $2$-connected graph of order at least $4s$, in which the neighborhood union of any two nonadjacent vertices has at least $4s$ vertices, contains $s$ vertex-disjoint chorded cycles.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms of unit distance graphs of layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $\varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, consider the metric spaces $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon]$ in the Euclidean plane named layers or strips. B. Baslaugh in 1998 found the minimal width $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ of a layer such that its unit distance graph contains a cycle of a given odd length $k$. The first of the main results of this paper is the fact that the unit distance graphs of two layers $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_1], \mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_2]$ are non-isomorphic for any different values $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2 \in (0,+\infty)$.
  We also get a multidimensional analogue of this theorem. For given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}, p \in (1,+\infty), \varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, we say that the metric space on $\mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]^m$ with the metric space distance generated by $l_p$-norm in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is a layer $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon)$. We show that the unit distance graphs of layers $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_1), L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_2)$ are non-isomorphic for $\varepsilon_1 \neq \varepsilon_2$.
  The third main result of this paper is the theorem that, for $n \geq 2, \varepsilon &gt; 0$, any automorphism $\phi$ of the unit distance graph of layer $L = L(n,1,2,\varepsilon) = \mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]$ is an isometry. This is related to the Beckman-Quarles theorem of 1953, which states that any unit-preserving mapping of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an isometry, and to the rational analogue of this theorem obtained by A. Sokolov in 2023.</description>

      <title>An improved quasi-isometry between graphs of bounded cliquewidth and graphs of bounded treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cliquewidth is a dense analogue of treewidth. It can be deduced from recent results by Hickingbotham [arXiv:2501.10840] and Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour [arXiv:2501.09839] that graphs of bounded cliquewidth are quasi-isometric to graphs of bounded treewidth. We improve on this by showing that graphs of cliquewidth $k$ admit a partition with `local, but dense' parts whose quotient has treewidth $k-1$. Specifically, each part is contained within the closed neighbourhood of some vertex. We use this to construct a $3$-quasi-isometry between graphs of cliquewidth $k$ and graphs of treewidth $k-1$. This is an improvement in both the quasi-isometry parameter and the treewidth. We also show that the bound on the treewidth is tight up to an additive constant.</description>

      <title>The strong hull property for affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjecture proposed by Gaetz and Gao asserts that the Cayley graph of any Coxeter group possesses the strong hull property. This conjecture has been proved for symmetric groups, hyperoctahedral groups, all right-angled Coxeter groups, and computationally verified for finite Coxeter groups of types $D_4$, $F_4$, $G_2$, and $H_3$. This paper investigates all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3, specifically those of affine types $\widetilde{A}_2$, $\widetilde{C}_2$, and $\widetilde{G}_2$. By employing key concepts from building theory, we develop novel techniques: first reducing and classifying the convex hull in their Cayley graphs into finitely many cases, then proving the strong hull conjecture for these cases through combinatorial computations. Notably, for the case of affine type $\widetilde{G}_2$, we streamline the proof strategy by reducing it to a corollary of results established for affine type $\widetilde{A}_2$. The reduction techniques developed in this study demonstrate potential for generalization. Their possible algebraic reformulation may not only provide new perspectives for further investigation of this conjecture but also offer methodological insights for algebraic combinatorics and geometric group theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group equivariant neural networks have proven effective in modelling a wide range of tasks where the data lives in a classical geometric space and exhibits well-defined group symmetries. However, these networks are not suitable for learning from data that lives in a non-commutative geometry, described formally by non-commutative $C^{*}$-algebras, since the $C^{*}$-algebra of continuous functions on a compact matrix group is commutative. To address this limitation, we derive the existence of a new type of equivariant neural network, called compact matrix quantum group equivariant neural networks, which encode symmetries that are described by compact matrix quantum groups. We characterise the weight matrices that appear in these neural networks for the easy compact matrix quantum groups, which are defined by set partitions. As a result, we obtain new characterisations of equivariant weight matrices for some compact matrix groups that have not appeared previously in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>The fundamental group and the magnitude-path spectral sequence of a directed graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental group of a directed graph admits a natural sequence of quotient groups called $r$-fundamental groups, and the $r$-fundamental groups can capture properties of a directed graph that the fundamental group cannot capture. The fundamental group of a directed graph is related to path homology through the Hurewicz theorem. The magnitude-path spectral sequence connects magnitude homology and path homology of a directed graph, and it may be thought of as a sequence of homology of a directed graph, including path homology. In this paper, we study relations of the $r$-fundamental groups and the magnitude-path spectral sequence through the Hurewicz theorem and the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating permutation equivariance into neural networks has proven to be useful in ensuring that models respect symmetries that exist in data. Symmetric tensors, which naturally appear in statistics, machine learning, and graph theory, are essential for many applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science, amongst others. However, existing research on permutation equivariant models has not explored symmetric tensors as inputs, and most prior work on learning from these tensors has focused on equivariance to Euclidean groups. In this paper, we present two different characterisations of all linear permutation equivariant functions between symmetric power spaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show on two tasks that these functions are highly data efficient compared to standard MLPs and have potential to generalise well to symmetric tensors of different sizes.</description>
