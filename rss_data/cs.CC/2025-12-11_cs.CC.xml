      <title>Derandomizing Isolation In Catalytic Logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A language is said to be in catalytic logspace if we can test membership using a deterministic logspace machine that has an additional read/write tape filled with arbitrary data whose contents have to be restored to their original value at the end of the computation. The model of catalytic computation was introduced by Buhrman et al [STOC2014].
  As our first result, we obtain a catalytic logspace algorithm for computing a minimum weight witness to a search problem, with small weights, provided the algorithm is given oracle access for the corresponding weighted decision problem. In particular, our reduction yields CL algorithms for the search versions of the following three problems: planar perfect matching, planar exact perfect matching and weighted arborescences in weighted digraphs.
  Our second set of results concern the significantly larger class CL^{NP}_{2-round}. We show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} contains SearchSAT and the complexity classes BPP, MA and ZPP^{NP[1]}. While SearchSAT is shown to be in CL^{NP}_{2-round} using the isolation lemma, the other three containments, while based on the compress-or-random technique, use the Nisan-Wigderson [JCSS 1994] based pseudo-random generator. These containments show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} resembles ZPP^NP more than P^{NP}, providing some weak evidence that CL is more like ZPP than P.
  For our third set of results we turn to isolation well inside catalytic classes. We consider the unambiguous catalytic class CUTISP[poly(n),logn,log^2n] and show that it contains reachability and therefore NL. This is a catalytic version of the result of van Melkebeek &amp; Prakriya [SIAM J. Comput. 2019]. Building on their result, we also show a tradeoff between workspace and catalytic space. Finally, we extend these catalytic upper bounds to LogCFL.</description>

      <title>Optimal certification of constant-local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of certifying local Hamiltonians from real-time access to their dynamics. Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$, matching the known $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy results for classes of countable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classes of countable graphs where every member does not contain a given finite graph as an induced subgraph -- denoted by $\mathsf{Free}(\mathcal{G})$ for a given finite graph $\mathcal{G}$. Our main results establish a structural dichotomy for such classes: If $\mathcal{G}$ is not an induced subgraph of $\mathcal{P}_4$, then $\mathsf{Free}(\mathcal{G})$ is on top under effective bi-interpretability, implying that the members of $\mathsf{Free}(\mathcal{G})$ exhibit the full range of structural and computational behaviors. In contrast, if $\mathcal{G}$ is an induced subgraph of $\mathcal{P}_4$, then $\mathsf{Free}(\mathcal{G})$ is structurally simple, as witnessed by the fact that every member satisfies the computable embeddability condition. This dichotomy is mirrored in the finite setting when one considers combinatorial and complexity-theoretic properties. Specifically, it is known that $\mathsf{Free}(\mathcal{G})^{fin}$ is complete for graph isomorphism and not a well-quasi-order under embeddability whenever $\mathcal{G}$ is not an induced subgraph of $\mathcal{P}_4$, while in all other cases $\mathsf{Free}(\mathcal{G})^{fin}$ forms a well-quasi-order and the isomorphism problem for $\mathsf{Free}(\mathcal{G})^{fin}$ is solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Colouring Graphs Without a Subdivided H-Graph: A Full Complexity Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Colouring on graphs that are $H$-subgraph-free for some fixed graph $H$, i.e., graphs that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided "H"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided "H"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut.</description>

      <title>Counting Small Induced Subgraphs: Hardness via Fourier Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed graph property $\Phi$ and integer $k \geq 1$, consider the problem of counting the induced $k$-vertex subgraphs satisfying $\Phi$ in an input graph $G$. This problem can be solved by brute-force in time $O(n^{k})$. Under ETH, we prove several lower bounds on the optimal exponent in this running time:
  If $\Phi$ is edge-monotone (i.e., closed under deleting edges), then ETH rules out $n^{o(k)}$ time algorithms for this problem. This strengthens a recent lower bound by D\"{o}ring, Marx and Wellnitz [STOC 2024]. Our result also holds for counting modulo fixed primes.
  If at most $(2-\varepsilon)^{\binom{k}{2}}$ graphs on $k$ vertices satisfy $\Phi$, for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, then ETH also rules out an exponent of $o(k)$. This holds even when the graphs in $\Phi$ have arbitrary individual weights, generalizing previous results for hereditary properties by Focke and Roth [SIAM J. Comput. 2024].
  If $\Phi$ is non-trivial and excludes $\beta_\Phi$ edge-densities, then the optimal exponent under ETH is $\Omega(\beta_\Phi)$. This holds even when the graphs in $\Phi$ have arbitrary individual weights, generalizing previous results by Roth, Schmitt and Wellnitz [SIAM J. Comput. 2024].
  In all cases, we also obtain $\mathsf{\#W[1]}$-hardness if $k$ is part of the input and considered as the parameter. We also obtain lower bounds on the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension. As opposed to the nontrivial techniques from combinatorics, group theory, and simplicial topology used before, our results follow from a relatively straightforward ``algebraization'' of the problem in terms of polynomials, combined with applications of simple algebraic facts, which can also be interpreted in terms of Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness for Search and Undecidability of PCSP Meta-Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an open question whether the search and decision versions of promise CSPs are equivalent. Most known algorithms for PCSPs solve only their \emph{decision} variant, and it is unknown whether they can be adapted to solve \emph{search} as well. The main approaches, called BLP, AIP and BLP+AIP, handle a PCSP by finding a solution to a relaxation of some integer program. We prove that rounding those solutions to a proper search certificate can be as hard as any problem in the class TFNP. In other words, these algorithms are ineffective for search. Building on the algebraic approach to PCSPs, we find sufficient conditions that imply ineffectiveness for search. Our tools are tailored to algorithms that are characterized by minions in a suitable way, and can also be used to prove undecidability results for meta-problems. This way, we show that the families of templates solvable via BLP, AIP, and BLP+AIP are undecidable.
  Using the same techniques we also analyze several algebraic conditions that are known to guarantee the tractability of finite-template CSPs. We prove that several meta-problems related to cyclic polymorphims and WNUs are undecidable for PCSPs. In particular, there is no algorithm deciding whether a finite PCSP template (1) admits cyclic a polymorphism, (2) admits a WNU.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Parameterised Complexity of Coverability in Vector Addition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the parameterised complexity of the classic coverability problem for vector addition systems (VAS): given a finite set of vectors $V \subseteq\mathbb{Z}^d$, an initial configuration $s\in\mathbb{N}^d$, and a target configuration $t\in\mathbb{N}^d$, decide whether starting from $s$, one can iteratively add vectors from $V$ to ultimately arrive at a configuration that is larger than or equal to $t$ on every coordinate, while not observing any negative value on any coordinate along the way. We consider two natural parameters for the problem: the dimension $d$ and the size of $V$, defined as the total bitsize of its encoding. We present several results charting the complexity of those two parameterisations, among which the highlight is that coverability for VAS parameterised by the dimension and with all the numbers in the input encoded in unary is complete for the class XNL under PL-reductions. We also discuss open problems in the topic, most notably the question about fixed-parameter tractability for the parameterisation by the size of $V$.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Barrier in Uniform Class Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a strong structural obstruction to Uniform Separation in constructive arithmetic. The mechanism is independent of semantic content; it emerges whenever two distinct evaluator predicates are sustained in parallel and inference remains uniformly representable in an extension of HA. Under these conditions, any putative Uniform Class Separation principle becomes a distinguished instance of a fixed point construction. The resulting limitation is stricter in scope than classical separation barriers (Baker; Rudich; Aaronson et al.) insofar as it constrains the logical form of uniform separation within HA, rather than limiting particular relativizing, naturalizing, or algebrizing techniques.</description>
