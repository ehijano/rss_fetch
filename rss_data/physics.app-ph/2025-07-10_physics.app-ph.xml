      <title>Theory of Dielectric Behavior in Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the properties of materials at microscopic scales are well described by fundamental quantum mechanical equations and electronic structure theories, the emergent behavior of mesoscopic or macroscopic composites is no longer governed solely by quantum effects. Instead, such systems are dominated by complex heterogeneous architectures and macroscopic interactions, presenting a classical many-body problem with unique complexities that remain less systematically understood than their quantum counterparts. In this work, we develop an operator-based theoretical framework to characterize these systems, using composite dielectric behavior as a paradigmatic example. By integrating effective medium theory with electromagnetic simulation techniques, we construct an operator that rigorously expresses the effective permittivity tensor as an exact functional. Global and local structure-property relationships can be established by analyzing the operator's structure through symmetric singular value decomposition and block operator matrix analysis, respectively. This framework bridges the gap between microscopic physics and macroscopic material behavior, offering a powerful approach for understanding diverse material properties and guiding the rational design of novel functional composites.</description>

      <title>Fully integrated automatic reusable microfluidic setup for immobilization, analysis and non-selective release of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microfluidic device that enables trapping, analysis, and on-demand release of individual microparticles through membrane deformation driven by pneumatic actuation. Inspired by Pachinko-style architectures, the system features an array of traps supported by a deformable PDMS membrane, actuated via pressure control in a pneumatic chamber bonded above. Unlike conventional rigid designs, our configuration enhances membrane flexibility using a wide elliptical cavity and suspended rectilinear flow guides. Device characterization was performed using confocal microscopy to measure membrane deformation under controlled negative pressure. The displacement profiles obtained were compared to several theoretical models, showing strong agreement with a thick-membrane approximation. Vertical membrane displacement exceeded 120 $\mu$m under -100 mbar, allowing release of 80 $\mu$m particles. We demonstrated rapid and repeatable particle trapping and release by applying coordinated fluidic and pneumatic pressures. The system was further integrated with a Python-based control interface using $\mu$Manager libraries, enabling automated sequences of particle trapping, imaging, and release. The protocol includes automated priming to eliminate air bubbles in the microchannels. This work introduces a robust and fully automated microfluidic platform capable of reversible microparticle immobilization. It is well suited for applications such as high-throughput screening, mechanobiology, or real-time imaging workflows that require precise control over individual object handling.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Vertical $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Schottky Diodes on Sapphire Using All-LPCVD Growth and Plasma-Free Ga-Assisted Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates quasi-vertical beta-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) fabricated on c-plane sapphire using an all-LPCVD, plasma-free process integrating epitaxial growth of high-quality beta-Ga2O3 and in-situ Ga-assisted etching. A 6.3 micron-thick (-201)-oriented beta-Ga2O3 layer was grown on c-sapphire with a 6-degree miscut, comprising a 3.15 micron moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer and a heavily doped (1e19 cm^-3) contact layer on a UID buffer. Mesa isolation used Ga-assisted LPCVD etching with 3.7 micron vertical profiles. SBDs showed excellent forward J-V behavior: 1.22 V turn-on, 1.29 ideality factor, and 0.83 eV barrier height. Minimum differential specific on-resistance was 8.6 mOhm*cm^2 with high current density (252 A/cm^2 at 5 V). C-V profiling revealed uniform doping at 2.1e17 cm^-3. J-V-T from 25 C to 250 C confirmed thermionic emission. Barrier height increased from 0.80 to 1.16 eV, and ideality factor from 1.31 to 1.42. Reverse leakage current remained low, increasing from ~5e-6 A/cm^2 to ~1e-4 A/cm^2; Ion/Ioff decreased from ~1e7 to 5e5. Breakdown voltages with moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer ranged between 59 and 100 V, with corresponding fields of 1.49 to 1.94 MV/cm. These results highlight the potential of LPCVD-grown and etched beta-Ga2O3 devices for high-performance power electronic applications.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Self-Powered Photoelectrochemical Detection Using Scalable InGaN/GaN Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectrochemical photodetectors (PEC-PDs) are promising owing to their simple, low-cost fabrication, self-powered operation, high photoresponse, and environmental sensitivity. In this work, we report for the first time the self-powered PEC photodetection characteristics of nanowire (NW) based green-emitting InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) PEC-PDs, fabricated via a scalable top-down approach.The device exhibits strong UV sensitivity with a peak at 365 nm and an extended response into the visible region.Notably, a high photoresponsivity of 330 mA/W was achieved at a lower illumination intensity of 0.7 mW/cm2. Furthermore, the photodetector demonstrates fast, stable, and reproducible performance across varying biases and illumination conditions. These results suggest that InGaN/GaN MQW nanowire-based PEC photodetectors hold strong promise for scalable, efficient, and stable self-powered optoelectronic applications</description>

      <title>Fast Forward and Inverse Thermal Modeling for Parameter Estimation of Multi-Layer composites -- Part I: Forward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents fast and accurate analytical methods for transient thermal modeling in multi-layer composites with an arbitrary number of layers. The proposed approach accounts for internal heat generation and non-homogeneities in the heat diffusion equation. The separation of variables (SOV) method is employed to decouple spatial and temporal components, enabling the determination of eigenvalues. The orthogonal expansion (OE) technique is then applied to compute Fourier coefficients using 'natural' orthogonality. An analytical solution for composites with constant heat sources is developed by combining the SOV method and OE technique. Additionally, a Green's function (GF) based approach is formulated to handle transient heat sources and other non-homogeneous conditions, including temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. The results demonstrate that the proposed method offers significantly faster computations compared to finite element (FE) methods, while maintaining high accuracy. This forward modeling approach serves as an efficient basis for inverse modeling, aimed at estimating unknown material properties and geometric deformations, which are explored in Part II of this study.</description>

      <title>Fast Forward and Inverse Thermal Modeling for Parameter Estimation of Multi-Layer Composites -- Part II: Inverse Modeling and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast inverse heat conduction model (IHCM) is developed for estimating unknown properties of multi-layer composites considering internal heat generation. This work builds on the validated analytical forward models presented in Part I. Transient temperature at a single point is used as input, with the objective function minimized through an interior-point optimization algorithm. The IHCM accurately estimates thermal properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, density, and heat transfer coefficient. It also identifies internal geometric variations and their locations, such as delamination caused by thermal expansion or mechanical motion. These predictions are validated through finite element (FE) simulations. Additionally, a sensorless strategy is introduced, providing a non-invasive inverse modeling approach. The feasibility, sensitivity and limitations of the proposed IHCM are evaluated across various scenarios. The results demonstrate strong potential for applications such as thermal performance monitoring, online defect detection, and real-time diagnostics in multi-layer composite systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of persistent photoconductivity in surface conducting hydrogenated diamond films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The p-type surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond (HD) has opened up new possibilities for the development of diamond-based electronic devices. However, the origin of the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) observed in surface-conducting HD remains unclear, an understanding that is crucial for advancing HD-based optoelectronic technologies. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism of PPC in surface-conducting HD films. A systematic analysis was performed by tuning the carrier density via partial oxygen termination using an ozonation process. With increasing O-termination, both the decay time and the recombination barrier of photoexcited electron-hole pairs were found to decrease significantly, from 232 to 5 seconds, and from ~ 150 to 54 meV, respectively. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that PPC in HD is influenced by random local potential fluctuations, which delay the recombination of photoexcited carriers. Furthermore, the observed PPC behavior is closely associated with percolative transport processes within the HD film. Importantly, the dependence of PPC on sheet carrier density is correlated with Coulomb interactions between the two-dimensional hole gas and the surface adsorbate layer. This study offers new insights into the PPC mechanism in surface-conducting HD films, contributing to the broader understanding necessary for the design of advanced diamond-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

For biosensing, nanophotonic platforms achieve unprecedented sensitivity in detecting biomolecules, pathogens, and pollutants, enabling real-time diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Medical applications leverage tailored light-matter interactions for precision photothermal therapy, image-guided surgery, and early disease detection. Furthermore, nanophotonics underpins next-generation optical neural networks and neuromorphic computing, offering ultra-fast, energy-efficient alternatives to von Neumann architectures. Despite rapid growth, challenges in scalability, fabrication costs, and material stability persist. Future advancements will rely on novel materials, AI-driven design optimization, and multidisciplinary approaches to enable scalable, low-cost deployment. This review summarizes recent progress and highlights future trends, including novel material systems, multidisciplinary approaches, and enhanced computational capabilities, to pave the way for transformative applications in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-assisted phase switching for crystal phase quantum dot fabrication in GaAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of several crystal phases within nanostructures of a single material presents both challenges and opportunities. While unintended phase mixing can degrade optoelectronic performances, deliberate control of polytypism enables novel heterostructures with unique quantum properties, crystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs). However, since tailoring the formation of CPQDs is difficult, applications remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-driven crystal phase switching in GaAs nanowires during vapor-liquid-solid growth, enabling precise control of crystal phases and creations of CPQDs with monolayer precision. Nanowires are epitaxially grown on custom-made silicon micro-substrates using chemical vapor deposition within an in-situ TEM. Real-time imaging reveals that the electric field switches instantaneously the crystal phase between zinc blende and wurtzite, creating atomically sharp interfaces. Numerical simulations are developed to investigate the impact of the electric field on the catalyst droplet geometry, which largely governs the crystal phase. This constitutes a key progress towards unlocking the potential of CPQDs.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Isotropic STED Nanoscopy using a Single Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) imaging requires an isotropic point spread function (PSF). However, the inherent missing aperture of a single objective lens results in an elongated, cigar-like PSF, which has rendered isotropic resolution in fluorescence microscopy seemingly insurmountable without a 4{\pi} configuration for decades. To address this long-standing challenge, we introduce ISO-STED (Isotropic Single-Objective STED) Nanoscopy, a novel approach that employs a single objective lens and a single depletion beam. By utilizing a hollow depletion focus, ISO-STED achieves an isotropic PSF without relying on a 4{\pi} configuration. This innovative design enables uniform fluorescence suppression in all directions, thereby yielding an isotropic 3D resolution of approximately 70 nm. Our work not only demonstrates the potential of ISO-STED Nanoscopy to provide a compact and versatile solution for isotropic 3D imaging in complex specimens but also paves the way for more accessible and practical applications in various research fields, including biomedical research and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Force sensing with a graphene nanomechanical resonator coupled to photonic crystal guided resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving optimal force sensitivity with nanomechanical resonators requires the ability to resolve their thermal vibrations. In two-dimensional resonators, this can be done by measuring the energy they absorb while vibrating in an optical standing wave formed between a light source and a mirror. However, the responsivity of this method -- the change in optical energy per unit displacement of the resonator -- is modest, fundamentally limited by the physics of propagating plane waves. We present simulations showing that replacing the mirror with a photonic crystal supporting guided resonances increases the responsivity of graphene resonators by an order of magnitude. The steep optical energy gradients enable efficient transduction of flexural vibrations using low optical power, thereby reducing heating. Furthermore, the presence of two guided resonances at different wavelengths allows thermal vibrations to be resolved with a high signal-to-noise ratio across a wide range of membrane positions in free space. Our approach provides a simple optical method for implementing ultrasensitive force detection using a graphene nanomechanical resonator.</description>

      <title>Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the convergence properties of a collection of iterative electron ptychography methods, under low electron doses ($&lt;$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$) and gives particular attention to the impact of the user-defined update strengths. We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result.</description>

      <title>Thickness-Dependent Spin Pumping in YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin pumping efficiency in YIG/YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ bilayers by measuring the thickness dependence of both the YIG and WTi layers using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. The deposition of a 5-nm WTi layer leads to enhanced Gilbert damping in thinner YIG films, indicating efficient spin current injection. From the spin pumping contribution to the damping of the YIG/WTi bilayer, we determine an effective spin mixing conductance of $ 3.3 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for the 5-nm WTi layer. Further measurements with varying WTi thickness reveal a non-monotonic dependence of spin mixing conductance, peaking at $ 4.2 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for a 3-nm WTi layer. This behavior is attributed to a structural phase transition from the high-spin--orbit $ \beta $-phase to the less efficient $ \alpha $-phase in thicker WTi layers. Furthermore, comparative analysis with YIG/W bilayers shows that Ti doping significantly reduces $ g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} $. These findings highlight the critical role of alloy composition and structural phase in tuning spin transport for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental Multiport-Network Parameter Estimation and Optimization for Multi-Bit RIS</title>

Abstract: Physics-consistent theoretical studies on RIS-parametrized wireless channels use models from multiport-network theory (MNT) to capture mutual-coupling (MC) effects. However, in practice, RIS design and radio environment are partially or completely unknown. We fill a research gap on how to estimate the MNT model parameters in such experimentally relevant scenarios. Our technique efficiently combines closed-form and gradient-descent steps, and it can be applied to multi-bit-programmable RIS elements. We discuss inevitable (but operationally irrelevant) parameter ambiguities. We experimentally validate our technique in an unknown rich-scattering environment parametrized by eight 6-bit-programmable RIS elements of unknown design. We experimentally evaluate the performance of RIS configurations optimized with the estimated MNT model and an MC-unaware cascaded model. While the models differ in accuracy by up to 17 dB, the end-to-end performance differences are small.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature mid-infrared detection using metasurface-absorber-integrated phononic crystal oscillator</title>

Abstract: Mid-infrared (MIR) detectors find extensive applications in chemical sensing, spectroscopy, communications, biomedical diagnosis and space explorations. Alternative to semiconductor MIR photodiodes and bolometers, mechanical-resonator-based MIR detectors show advantages in higher sensitivity and lower noise at room temperature, especially towards longer wavelength infrared. Here, we demonstrate uncooled room-temperature MIR detectors based on lithium niobate surface acoustic wave phononic crystal (PnC) resonators integrated with wavelength-and-polarization-selective metasurface absorber arrays. The detection is based on the resonant frequency shift induced by the local temperature change due to MIR absorptions. The PnC resonator is configured in an oscillating mode, enabling active readout and low frequency noise. Compared with detectors based on tethered thin-film mechanical resonators, our non-suspended, fully supported PnC resonators offer lower noise, faster thermal response, and robustness in both fabrication and practical applications. Our 1-GHz oscillator-based MIR detector shows a relative frequency deviation of $5.24 \times 10^{-10}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at an integration time of 50 ${\mu}$s, leading to an incident noise equivalent power of 197 pW/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ when input 6-${\mu}$m MIR light is modulated at 1.8 kHz, and a large dynamic range of 107 in incident MIR power. Our device architecture is compatible with the scalable manufacturing process and can be readily extended to a broader spectral range by tailoring the absorbing wavelengths of metasurface absorbers.</description>

      <title>Unlocking high coercivity at room temperature in phase modified MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.</description>
