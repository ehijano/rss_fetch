      <title>On the Bessel function and $n$-dimensional Hankel transform with Bicomplex arguments and coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce bicomplex Bessel function and analyze its region of convergence. Important properties of the bicomplex Bessel function, such as recurrence relations, integral representations, differential relations are explored. Moreover a differential equation satisfied by the bicomplex Bessel function is established. Furthermore, we investigate bicomplex holomorphicity and discuss its asymptotic behavior. Finally, we define $n$-dimensional bicomplex Hankel transformation by using bicomplex Bessel function and show that it is an isomorphism between two suitably defined function spaces. The application of the $n$-dimensional bicomplex Hankel transform has been effectively demonstrated by solving some partial differential equations. Additionally, a new extension of coherent states is built based on the use of the bicomplex Bessel function and demonstrate that these states fulfill the conditions of normalizability, continuity and the resolution of unity.</description>

      <title>On embedding theorems in analytic and harmonic function spaces of several complex variables in some domains in $C^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey we collect some recent advances concerning embedding theorems in analytic and harmonic function spaces of several complex variables in various domains in $C^n$. The paper is based mainly only on recent results in this research area of the first author, but some recent new interesting nice, results of other authors will also be added in this survey in addition. Some rather short, but valuable discussions of related to this area of research problems in analytic and harmonic function spaces of one and several complex variables will also be provided and in addition some open questions in this reseach area will also be discusssed shortly and posed by us. The paper contains also various rather short but valuable interesting comments concerning this research area of analytic and harmonic function spaces of one and several complex variables. Some sharp embedding results presented in this survey paper extend sharp embeddings in analytic function spaces obtained in higher dimension previously by J. Ortega, J. Fabrega, W. Cima, D. Luecking, M. Abate and many others in recent decades in the unit ball and bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains with the smooth boundary for onefunctional case to similar type analytic multyfunctional Bergman type function spaces. Same type multifunctional sharp extensions of some recent embedding results of one functional analytic function spaces of B. Sehba and D. Bekolle will be provided by us in this survey for unbounded domains namely for tubular domains over symmetric cones. In this paper we collect many new sharp embeddings obtained recently by first author though some one dimensional new sharp embeddings will be also mentioned shortly at the end of paper.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic functions with Nash real part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a holomorphic function, defined on an open subset $D$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$, is a complex Nash function if and only if its real part (or equivalently its imaginary part) is a real Nash function.</description>

      <title>Lines in the space of K\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence for weak geodesic lines in the (completed) space of K\"ahler metrics. We construct a wide range of weak geodesic lines on arbitrary projective K\"ahler manifolds that are not generated by holomorphic vector fields, thus disproving a folklore conjecture popularized by Berndtsson. Remarkably, some of these weak geodesic lines turn out to be smooth. In the case of Riemann surfaces, our results can be significantly sharpened. Finally, we investigate the validity of Euclid's fifth postulate for the space of K\"ahler metrics.</description>
