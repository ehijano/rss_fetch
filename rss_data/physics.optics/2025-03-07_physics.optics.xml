      <title>Chiral broadband High Harmonic Generation Source by Vectorial Time-Polarization-Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral (highly helical) extreme ultraviolet (XUV) sources are pivotal for investigating chiroptical phenomena on the ultrafast electronic timescale. Table-top, coherent High Harmonic Generation (HHG)-based sources are particularly well-suited for these studies. However, chiral materials, such as organic chiral molecules and solid-state magnetic materials, exhibit fine spectral features which necessitate broadband radiation for their complete interrogation. The generation of radiation that is both broadband and helical through HHG presents a seemingly paradoxical challenge: while chiral HHG emission requires at least two recollisions occurring along different directions in the polarization plane, the Floquet limit might already be reached with as few as three recollisions, resulting in a sparse spectrum characterized by pronounced discrete harmonic peaks. Here we propose a straightforward scheme that enables the interrogation of fine spectral features, in principle restricted only by the resolution of the XUV spectrometer, with chiral XUV light. Our method is based on using a vectorial two-color driver with close central-frequencies with slight symmetry breaking. It integrates the time-gating and polarization-gating techniques to generate a vectorial driver which induces well-controlled bursts of recollisions, occurring along different directions in the polarization plane. The method satisfies the dual requirements of an XUV source which is both broadband and helical. We perform polarization scan and demonstrate that the broadband XUV radiation exhibits rapid modulations in its spectral ellipticity, and fast alternation in its spectral helicities. The phase of modulations could be controlled by introducing a slight symmetry breaking. This allows us to control and modulate the XUV polarization state, which should enable the detection of chiroptical signals with enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Resolving polarization-dependent mode dynamics in multimode fibers with 2D single-photon detector arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring polarization dynamics in multimode fibers is critical for a range of applications, spanning from optical communication to sensing. Although the modal behavior of multimode fibers is well understood through interferometry and advanced detection techniques, most studies focus on a single polarization state of specific modes, leaving the spatial mode dynamics of the other polarization state unexplored. A variety of optical phenomena can arise during the transport of spatial modes in fibers, driven by stress-induced fiber deformations. These phenomena include changes in the effective refractive index of modes, modal dispersion, and polarization-dependent mode coupling. Observing such modal behavior typically requires complex systems, such as multi-axis interferometry. In this paper, we present quasi-real-time observation of spatial mode dynamics in a two-mode fiber using 2D single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays configured in a dual-axis setup under different fiber deformation conditions. By utilizing the time-resolved capabilities of the SPAD arrays, we capture the modal behavior of two spatial modes in the fiber during stress induced by uncontrolled deformations, enabling direct observation of spatial correlations of the modes. Additionally, we demonstrate dual-polarization mode dynamics under controlled fiber conformation, where the modal behavior remains stable within acceptable error limits. Our work opens new avenues for exploring polarization-dependent phenomena in both fundamental and applied optics, as well as in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-scale Cavities for Far-infrared Radiation via Acoustic Phonon Polariton Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface polaritons play a pivotal role in enabling and controlling strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale due to their ability to carry large momentum, thus confining light to deep subwavelength dimensions. These polaritons are supported by materials with negative real-part permittivity, such as surface-plasmon-polaritons in metals, and plasmons in graphene, for example. A promising class of materials that exhibit negative permittivity is that of polar dielectrics, which can support surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs). While SPhPs offer significantly lower losses compared to other surface polaritons, their potential has been underutilized due to their limited ability to carry large momentum. In this work, we demonstrate the experimental realization of acoustic surface-phonon-polaritons (APhPs) - a hybridized SPhPs mode that can carry large momentum. We achieve this by realizing phononic resonators in a system composed of nanometric-sized silver cubes deposited on a SiC polar dielectric. The nanocube creates a mirror image of the SPhP, forming the hybridized APhP mode. We find that the APhPs resonators can confine far-infrared radiation to extremely small mode volumes, which are almost a billion times smaller than their free-space mode-volume. Moreover, we show that owing to their inherently low losses, APhPs exhibit quality factors that are an order of magnitude greater than those of surface plasmons or graphene plasmons, surpassing values of 180. Finally, we demonstrate that the spectral response and intensity of the APhP resonators can be precisely controlled by adjusting the size and concentration of the nanocubes. Our method is general, scalable, and applicable to any polar dielectric across a broad spectrum of materials and wavelengths, opening the path for controlling and manipulating strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale in the long-wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Compact and fully functional high-frequency sine wave gating InGaAs/InP single-photon detector module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency sine wave gating (SWG) InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors (SPDs) are widely used for synchronous near-infrared single-photon detection. For practical use, the size of SPD is one of the most concerning features for system integration. Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the most compact and fully functional high-frequency SWG InGaAs/InP SPD. We develop a sine wave gating integrated circuit (SWGIC) using system-in-package technology that supports functions including large amplitude sine wave gate generation, coincidence gate generation, phase regulation, amplitude monitoring, and amplitude modulation. Moreover, we design and fabricate a high-performance multi-mode fiber coupled InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) with a compact butterfly package. Furthermore, we implement a monolithically integrated readout circuit (MIRC) to extract the weak avalanche signal from large capacitance response of SWG. Finally, the SWGIC, SPAD, MIRC, and the affiliated circuits are integrated into a single module with a size of 6 cm x 5.7 cm x 1.7 cm. After characterization, the SPD module exhibits a photon detection efficiency of 40%, a dark count rate of 9 kcps, and an afterpulse probability of 4.6% at an operation temperature of 238 K and a hold-off time of 160 ns. Our work provides a practical solution for applications necessitating highly integrated near-infrared single-photon detection.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Dirac-vortex topological photonic crystal fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) that trap and guide light using photonic bandgaps have revolutionized modern optics with enormous scientific innovations and technological applications spanning many disciplines. Recently, inspired by the discovery of topological phases of matter, Dirac-vortex topological PCFs have been theoretically proposed with intriguing topological properties and unprecedented opportunities in optical fiber communications. However, due to the substantial challenges of fabrication and characterization, experimental demonstration of Dirac-vortex topological PCFs has thus far remained elusive. Here, we report the experimental realization of a Dirac-vortex topological PCF using the standard stack-and-draw fabrication process with silica glass capillaries. Moreover, we experimentally observe that Dirac-vortex single-polarization single-mode bounds to and propagates along the fiber core in the full communication window (1260-1675nm). Our study pushes the research frontier of PCFs and provides a new avenue to enhance their performance and functionality further.</description>

      <title>Optical force and torque on a spinning dielectric sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical force can enable precise manipulations of small particles for various applications. It is well known that an isotropic lossless dielectric sphere is only subject to forward optical force under the illumination of an electromagnetic plane wave. By using rigorous full-wave simulations, we show that such a sphere can experience a lateral optical force and an optical torque besides the conventional longitudinal force, if it spins with a constant angular velocity. The emergence of the unusual optical force and torque is attributed to the breaking of mirror and cylindrical symmetries by the spinning motion. Using the multipole expansion in source representation, we illustrate how the spinning-induced effective bi-anisotropy generates the lateral force and torque on the sphere through the interference of electric and magnetic multipoles. We also uncover the effect of Sagnac frequency splitting on the optical force and torque. The results contribute to the understanding of the optical force and torque in moving media and can be applied to realize unconventional optical manipulations of small particles.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray imaging with coherence tomography in the water window spectral range using high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is used as a source for various imaging applications in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. It offers spatially coherent radiation and unique elemental contrast with the potential for attosecond time resolution. The unfavorable efficiency scaling to higher photon energies prevented the imaging application in the soft X-ray range so far. In this work we demonstrate the feasibility of using harmonics for imaging in the water window spectral region (284$\,$eV to 532$\,$eV). We achieve nondestructive depth profile imaging in a heterostructure by utilizing a broadband and noise-resistant technique called soft X-ray Coherence Tomography (SXCT) at a high-flux lab-scale HHG source. SXCT is derived from Optical Coherence Tomography, a Fourier based technique, that can use the full bandwidth of the source to reach an axial resolution of 12$\,$nm in this demonstration. The employed source covers the entire water window, with a photon flux exceeding 10$^\text{6}\,$photons/eV/s at a photon energy of 500$\,$eV. We show local cross sections of a sample consisting of Aluminium oxide and Platinum layers of varying thickness on a Zinc oxide substrate. We validate the findings with scanning and transmission electron microscopy after preparation with focused ion beam milling.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference and occupation control in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Twisted heterobilayer photonic crystal based on stacking and selective etching of 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic devices with moir\'e superlattice is currently attracting broad interest due to the unique periodicity and high efficiency control of photons. Till now, experimental investigations mainly focus on the single layer device, i.e., two or more layers of photonic crystal patterns are merged and etched in a single layer of material. By comparison, twisted photonic crystal with multilayer materials raises challenges in the nanofabrication technology, because the growth of upper layer material usually requires a smooth bottom layer without nanostructures. Hereby, we fabricate twisted heterobilayer photonic crystal in the graphite/Si$_3$N$_4$ heterostructure. We use dry transfer method to stack the graphite on top of bottom Si$_3$N$_4$ with pre-etched photonic crystal patterns. Selective dry etching recipes are used to etch two photonic crystal layers individually, which improves the quality and accuracy in alignment. The cavity photonic mode at the visible wavelength $\sim 700$ nm arsing from the moir\'e site is clearly observed in experiment. These results reveal the experimental diagram of heterobilayer nanophotonic devices and open the way to design flexibility and control of photons in new degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the paraxial beam model in the study of quantum vacuum signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared laser chaos lidar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos lidars detect targets through the cross-correlation between the back-scattered chaos signal from the target and the local reference one. Chaos lidars have excellent anti-jamming and anti-interference capabilities, owing to the random nature of chaotic oscillations. However, most chaos lidars operate in the near-infrared spectral regime, where the atmospheric attenuation is significant. Here we show a mid-infrared chaos lidar, which is suitable for long-reach ranging and imaging applications within the low-loss transmission window of the atmosphere. The proof-of-concept mid-infrared chaos lidar utilizes an interband cascade laser with optical feedback as the laser chaos source. Experimental results reveal that the chaos lidar achieves an accuracy better than 0.9 cm and a precision better than 0.3 cm for ranging distances up to 300 cm. In addition, it is found that a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of only 1 dB is required to sustain both sub-cm accuracy and sub-cm precision. This work paves the way for developing remote chaos lidar systems in the mid-infrared spectral regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs and their spectra of evenly spaced discrete laser lines are essential to modern time and frequency metrology. Recent advances in integrated photonic waveguides enable efficient nonlinear broadening of an initially narrowband frequency comb to multi-octave bandwidth. Here, we study the nonlinear dynamics in the generation of such ultra-broadband spectra where different harmonics of the comb can overlap. We show that a set of interleaved combs with different offset frequencies extending across the entire spectrum can emerge, which transform into a single evenly spaced ultra-broadband frequency comb when the initial comb is offset-free.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Nanophotonics for High-Dimensional Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nanophotonics merges the precision of nanoscale light manipulation with the capabilities of quantum technologies, offering a pathway for enhanced light-matter interaction and compact realization of quantum devices. Here, we show how a recently-demonstrated nonlinear nanophotonic process can be employed to selectively create photonic high-dimensional quantum states (qudits). We utilize the nonlinearity on the surface of the nanophotonic device to dress, through the polarization of the pump field, the near-field modes carrying angular momentum and their superpositions. We then use this approach for the realization of a multilevel quantum key distribution protocol, which doubles the key rate compared to standard schemes. This idea is an important step towards experimental realizations of quantum state generation and manipulation through nonlinearity within nanophotonic platforms, and enables new capabilities for on-chip quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: The significant growth of free-space optic communications and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is demanding gratings that emit highly collimated beams, i.e. with Rayleigh ranges of millimeters or even centimeters. Hence, weak-strength gratings, which radiate little amount of power per unit length, are needed. The main purpose of this work is to propose an efficient and accurate simulation tool to accelerate the design of weak-strength gratings required for these applications. To achieve this, we propose a simulator based on the classical perturbation method, which takes a circuit approach to the electromagnetic problem. Comparison with results obtained with a rigorous 2D full wave electromagnetic simulator (FEXEN) shows very good agreement with the advantage of decreasing simulation times by up to a factor $\times 16$</description>

      <title>Magnetic Permeability Time-varying Metamaterials at Microwave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate magnetic permeability time-varying metamaterials at GHz frequencies using ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni80Fe20; Py). We observe frequency up and down conversion of 4 GHz microwaves through the metamaterials, which is caused by the temporal modulation of permeability in the Py layer. Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials. The present study opens a door to microwave sources toward the 6th-generation mobile communication system, four-dimensional metamaterials with spatio-temporal modulation, and nonlinear spintronics.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh free-electron Kerr nonlinearity in all-semiconductor waveguides for all-optical nonlinear modulation of mid-infrared light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical waveguides, particularly those harnessing the optical Kerr effect, are promising for advancing next-generation photonic technologies. Despite the Kerr effect`s ultrafast response, its inherently weak nonlinearity has hindered practical applications. Here, we explore free-electron-induced Kerr nonlinearities in all-semiconductor waveguides, revealing that longitudinal bulk plasmons (inherently nonlocal excitations) can generate exceptionally strong Kerr nonlinearities. We specifically develop a nonlinear eigenmode analysis integrated with semiclassical hydrodynamic theory to compute the linear and nonlinear optical responses originating from the quantum behavior of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors. These waveguides achieve ultrahigh nonlinear coefficients exceeding 10$^7$ W$^{-1}$km$^{-1}$ and support long-propagating modes with propagation distances over 100 $\mu$m. Additionally, we confirm the robustness of the nonlinear response under realistic conditions by considering viscoelastic and nonlinear damping mechanisms. Finally, we implement our all-semiconductor waveguides in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, demonstrating efficient nonlinear modulation of the transmittance spectrum via the free-electron Kerr effect. This work evidences the transformative potential of free-electron nonlinearities in heavily doped semiconductors for photonic integrated circuits, paving the way for scalable on-chip nonlinear nanophotonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) provides a compelling approach to quantum information processing, with a short list of physical requirements; however, experimental implementations have faced significant challenges. Itinerant phonons in quantum acoustics, combined with superconducting qubits, offer a compelling alternative to the quantum optics approach. Here we demonstrate key advances in the ability to manipulate and measure acoustic phonon quantum states: First, we demonstrate deterministic phase control of itinerant one- and two-phonon qubit states, measured using an acoustic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We implement phonon phase control using the frequency-dependent scattering of phonon states from a superconducting transmon qubit. The acoustic interferometer used to measure the resulting phonon phase achieves a noise-floor-limited Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference visibility of 98.1%, representing a significant improvement over our previous demonstration. Additionally, we propose and implement a multi-phonon detection scheme that enables coherent conversion between itinerant one- and two-phonon Fock states and transmon qutrit states, transforming for example the Hong-Ou-Mandel two-phonon entangled output state $|02\rangle - |20\rangle$ into the entangled state of two transmons. The tight integration of quantum acoustics with superconducting circuits native to our implementation promises further advances, including deterministic phonon quantum gates with direct applications to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Classification of Fragile Topology Enabled by Matrix Homotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moire flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene have attracted considerable attention not only because of the emergence of correlated phases but also due to their nontrivial topology. Specifically, they exhibit a new class of topology that can be nullified by the addition of trivial bands, termed fragile topology, which suggests the need for an expansion of existing classification schemes. Here, we develop a Z2 energy-resolved topological marker for classifying fragile phases using a system's position-space description, enabling the direct classification of finite, disordered, and aperiodic materials. By translating the physical symmetries protecting the system's fragile topological phase into matrix symmetries of the system's Hamiltonian and position operators, we use matrix homotopy to construct our topological marker while simultaneously yielding a quantitative measure of topological robustness. We show our framework's effectiveness using a C2T-symmetric twisted bilayer graphene model and photonic crystal as a continuum example. We have found that fragile topology can persist both under strong disorder and in heterostructures lacking a bulk spectral gap, and even an example of disorder-induced re-entrant topology. Overall, the proposed scheme serves as an effective tool for elucidating aspects of fragile topology, offering guidance for potential applications across a variety of experimental platforms from topological photonics to correlated phases in materials.</description>

Abstract: The refraction of light by dispersion-free dielectric media can be modeled using well-localized macroscopic wave packets, enabling a description in terms of pseudo-particles. This approach is often used in thought experiments to illustrate aspects of the Abraham-Minkowski debate. This work uses the particle picture to show at an elementary level how different types of momenta come into play, and how light refraction can be explained at the level of particles. A special exactly solvable microscopic model is used to illustrate the interplay and tension between microscopic physics and the conventional effective-medium Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener tunneling among Floquet states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic fields not only induce electronic transitions but also fundamentally modify the quantum states of matter through strong light-matter interactions. As one established route, Floquet engineering provides a powerful framework to dress electronic states with time-periodic fields, giving rise to quasi-stationary Floquet states. With increasing field strength, non-perturbative responses of the dressed states emerge, yet their nonlinear dynamics remain challenging to interpret. In this work we explore the emergence of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions among Floquet states in Cu(111) under intense optical fields. At increasing field strength, we observe a transition from perturbative dressing to a regime where Floquet states undergo non-adiabatic tunneling, revealing a breakdown of adiabatic Floquet evolution. These insights are obtained through interferometrically time-resolved multi-photon photoemission spectroscopy, which serves as a sensitive probe of transient Floquet state dynamics. Numerical simulations and the theory of instantaneous Floquet states allow us to directly examine real-time excitation pathways in this non-perturbative photoemission regime. Our results establish a direct connection the onset of light-dressing of matter, non-perturbative ultrafast lightwave electronics, and high-optical-harmonic generation in the solids.</description>

Abstract: This paper constructs metalenses that separate homogeneous media with different refractive indices, refracting one domain into another while conserving a prescribed energy distribution. Using optimal transport theory, we design singlet and doublet metalenses for energy-conserving by refraction and employ multi-marginal optimal transport to create a refracting-reflecting metalens that preserves given energy distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a model for the paraxial propagation of vector beams. Of particular importance is the appearance of a new transverse momentum term proportional to the linear polarization angle gradient imparted to the beam during the beam preparation process. The model predicts that during propagation, this new momentum will be exchanged for classical transverse momentum, thereby causing the beam to accelerate. We observe the momentum exchange in experiment by designing the polarization profile in such a way as to cause the beam centroid to follow a parabolic path through free space.</description>

      <title>Quantum backreaction effect in optical solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical solitons classically are stationary solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We perform a quantum field theoretic treatment by quantising a linearised fluctuation field around the classical soliton solution which can be seen as providing a background spacetime for the field. The linearised fluctuation modifies the soliton background, which is often neglected, reminiscent of the nondepleted-pump approximation. Going beyond this approximation and by using a number-conserving Bogoliubov approach, we find unstable modes that grow as the soliton propagates. Eventually, these unstable modes induce a considerable (backreaction) effect in the soliton. We calculate the backreaction in the classical field fully analytically in the leading second order. The result is a quadratic local decrease of the soliton photon number in propagation due to the backreaction effect of the unstable mode. Provided the initial pulse is close to the classical soliton solution, the unstable mode contributions always become dominant. We also consider practical scenarios for observing this quantum-induced soliton distortion, in the spectral domain. The backreaction, which we expect to be present in bright and dark, discrete and continuous solitons and other nonlinear pulses plays an important role in future optical analogue gravity experiments, for soliton lasers, and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Disordered Optical Metasurfaces: Basics, Properties, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance. They present a particularly exciting opportunity in applications demanding large-scale implementation, such as sustainable renewable energy systems, as well as aesthetically vibrant coatings for luxury goods and architectural designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential absorption Lidar (DIAL) in the ultraviolet (UV) region is an effective approach for monitoring tropospheric ozone. 4H-SiC single-photon detectors (SPDs) are emergent devices for UV single-photon detection. Here, we demonstrate a 4H-SiC SPD-based ozone DIAL. We design and fabricate the 4H-SiC single-photon avalanche diode with a beveled mesa structure and optimized layer thickness. An active quenching circuit with a quenching time of 1.03 ns is developed to significantly mitigate the afterpulsing effect while enhancing the maximum count rate. After characterization, the SPD exhibits excellent performance with a photon detection efficiency of 16.6% at 266 nm, a dark count rate of 138 kcps, a maximum count rate of 13 Mcps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.7% at room temperature. Then, we apply two 4H-SiC SPDs in an ozone DIAL. The measured ozone concentrations at altitudes of 1-3.5 km agree well with the results of a commercial ozone DIAL. Our work provides an alternative solution for general UV Lidar applications.</description>

      <title>All-optical coherent control of chiral electronic transitions for highly enantioselective photochemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enantioselective photochemistry provides access to unique molecular structures and functions, with deep implications for fundamental science and industrial applications. Current methods for highly enantioselective photochemistry critically rely on chiral sensitisers, as circularly polarised light on its own yields vanishingly weak enantioselectivity. Here, we introduce a quantum control strategy to drive highly enantioselective electronic excitations in randomly oriented samples using a pulsed ($\sim$22 fs) IR laser and two of its harmonics, in the absence of intermediate resonances. Our approach addresses electronic transitions, does not require chiral sensitisers, or cold molecules, or long electronic coherence times, is relevant for liquid-phase samples, and remains effective over interaction regions extending across many laser wavelengths, even in the presence of dispersion. We show how, by 3D shaping the field's polarisation over the interaction region, we can achieve enantioselective coherent control over electronic population transfer. Our ab-initio simulations in the chiral molecule carvone yield a selectivity of $\sim$30 % in the populations of the first excited electronic state, three orders-of-magnitude higher than what is possible with circularly polarised light ($\sim$0.01 %). These results bring all-optical enantioselective photochemistry into the realm of practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Boson sampling is one of the leading protocols for demonstrating a quantum advantage, but the theory of how this protocol responds to noise is still incomplete. We extend the theory of classical simulation of boson sampling with partial distinguishability to the case where the degree of indistinguishability between photon pairs is different between different pairs.</description>

      <title>Efficient detection of entanglement by stimulated disentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard detection of entanglement relies on local measurements of the individual particles, evaluating their correlations in post-processing. For time-energy entangled photons, either times $(t_{1},t_{2})$ or energies $(E_{1},E_{2})$ are measured, but not both due to the mutual quantum uncertainty, providing only partial information of the entanglement. In principle, a global detector could recover the complete information of entanglement in a single shot if it could measure the combined correlated variables $(t_{1}-t_{2})$ and $(E_{1}+E_{2})$ without measuring the individual energies or times. Such a global measurement is possible using the reverse disentangling interaction, like sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level are exceedingly inefficient. We overcome this barrier by stimulating the nonlinear SFG interaction with a strong pump, thereby measuring both the energy-sum (SFG spectrum) and the time-difference (response to group delay/dispersion) simultaneously and efficiently. We generate bi-photons with extreme time-energy entanglement (octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty between time-difference and energy-sum of $\Delta(t_1-t_2)\Delta(E_1+E_2)\approx\!2\!\cdot\!10^{-13}h$, violating the classical bound by more than 12 orders of magnitude. The presented coherent SFG dramatically enhances the detection SNR compared to standard methods since it ideally rejects erroneous coincidences in both time and energy, paving the way for sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar) and more.</description>
