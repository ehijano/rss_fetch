      <title>FFT-based surrogate modeling of auxetic metamaterials with real-time prediction of effective elastic properties and swift inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auxetic structures, known for their negative Poisson's ratio, exhibit effective elastic properties heavily influenced by their underlying structural geometry and base material properties. While periodic homogenization of auxetic unit cells can be used to investigate these properties, it is computationally expensive and limits design space exploration and inverse analysis. In this paper, surrogate models are developed for the real-time prediction of the effective elastic properties of auxetic unit cells with orthogonal voids of different shapes. The unit cells feature orthogonal voids in four distinct shapes, including rectangular, diamond, oval, and peanut-shaped voids, each characterized by specific void diameters. The generated surrogate models accept geometric parameters and the elastic properties of the base material as inputs to predict the effective elastic constants in real-time. This rapid evaluation enables a practical inverse analysis framework for obtaining the optimal design parameters that yield the desired effective response. The fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach is adopted to efficiently generate data for developing the surrogate models, bypassing concerns about periodic mesh generation and boundary conditions typically associated with the finite element method (FEM). The performance of the generated surrogate models is rigorously examined through a train/test split methodology, a parametric study, and an inverse problem. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed, offering real-time prediction of the effective tangent stiffness and performing inverse analysis to determine optimal geometric parameters.</description>

      <title>Smart Home Cyber Insurance Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our homes are increasingly employing various kinds of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, leading to the notion of smart homes. While this trend brings convenience to our daily life, it also introduces cyber risks. To mitigate such risks, the demand for smart home cyber insurance has been growing rapidly. However, there are no studies on analyzing the competency of smart home cyber insurance policies offered by cyber insurance vendors (i.e., insurers), where `competency' means the insurer is profitable and smart home owners are not overly charged with premiums and/or deductibles. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for pricing smart home cyber insurance, which can be adopted by insurers in practice. Our case studies show, among other things, that insurers are over charging smart home owners in terms of premiums and deductibles.</description>

      <title>Efficient FGM optimization with a novel design space and DeepONet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript proposes an optimization framework to find the tailor-made functionally graded material (FGM) profiles for thermoelastic applications. This optimization framework consists of (1) a random profile generation scheme, (2) deep learning (DL) based surrogate models for the prediction of thermal and structural quantities, and (3) a genetic algorithm (GA). From the proposed random profile generation scheme, we strive for a generic design space that does not contain impractical designs, i.e., profiles with sharp gradations. We also show that the power law is a strict subset of the proposed design space. We use a dense neural network-based surrogate model for the prediction of maximum stress, while the deep neural operator DeepONet is used for the prediction of the thermal field. The point-wise effective prediction of the thermal field enables us to implement the constraint that the metallic content of the FGM remains within a specified limit. The integration of the profile generation scheme and DL-based surrogate models with GA provides us with an efficient optimization scheme. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Information Extraction for Event-Based Surveillance using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to epidemic surveillance, leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) for effective interpretation of unstructured big data sources, like the popular ProMED and WHO Disease Outbreak News. We explore several LLMs, evaluating their capabilities in extracting valuable epidemic information. We further enhance the capabilities of the LLMs using in-context learning, and test the performance of an ensemble model incorporating multiple open-source LLMs. The findings indicate that LLMs can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of epidemic modelling and forecasting, offering a promising tool for managing future pandemic events.</description>

      <title>An optimization-based coupling of reduced order models with efficient reduced adjoint basis generation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization-based coupling (OBC) is an attractive alternative to traditional Lagrange multiplier approaches in multiple modeling and simulation contexts. However, application of OBC to time-dependent problem has been hindered by the computational costs of finding the stationary points of the associated Lagrangian, which requires primal and adjoint solves. This issue can be mitigated by using OBC in conjunction with computationally efficient reduced order models (ROM). To demonstrate the potential of this combination, in this paper we develop an optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling for a transient advection-diffusion transmission problem. The main challenge in this formulation is the generation of adjoint snapshots and reduced bases for the adjoint systems required by the optimizer. One of the main contributions of the paper is a new technique for efficient adjoint snapshot collection for gradient-based optimizers in the context of optimization-based ROM-ROM couplings. We present numerical studies demonstrating the accuracy of the approach along with comparison between various approaches for selecting a reduced order basis for the adjoint systems, including decay of snapshot energy, iteration counts, and timings.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Collaboration of LLM based Agents for Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interactions between multiple agents within Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of programming and coding tasks. We utilize the AutoGen framework to facilitate communication among agents, evaluating different configurations based on the success rates from 40 random runs for each setup. The study focuses on developing a flexible automation framework for applying the Finite Element Method (FEM) to solve linear elastic problems. Our findings emphasize the importance of optimizing agent roles and clearly defining their responsibilities, rather than merely increasing the number of agents. Effective collaboration among agents is shown to be crucial for addressing general FEM challenges. This research demonstrates the potential of LLM multi-agent systems to enhance computational automation in simulation methodologies, paving the way for future advancements in engineering and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>STAResNet: a Network in Spacetime Algebra to solve Maxwell's PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce STAResNet, a ResNet architecture in Spacetime Algebra (STA) to solve Maxwell's partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, networks in Geometric Algebra (GA) have been demonstrated to be an asset for truly geometric machine learning. In \cite{brandstetter2022clifford}, GA networks have been employed for the first time to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrating an increased accuracy over real-valued networks. In this work we solve Maxwell's PDEs both in GA and STA employing the same ResNet architecture and dataset, to discuss the impact that the choice of the right algebra has on the accuracy of GA networks. Our study on STAResNet shows how the correct geometric embedding in Clifford Networks gives a mean square error (MSE), between ground truth and estimated fields, up to 2.6 times lower than than obtained with a standard Clifford ResNet with 6 times fewer trainable parameters. STAREsNet demonstrates consistently lower MSE and higher correlation regardless of scenario. The scenarios tested are: sampling period of the dataset; presence of obstacles with either seen or unseen configurations; the number of channels in the ResNet architecture; the number of rollout steps; whether the field is in 2D or 3D space. This demonstrates how choosing the right algebra in Clifford networks is a crucial factor for more compact, accurate, descriptive and better generalising pipelines.</description>

      <title>Reactzyme: A Benchmark for Enzyme-Reaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzymes, with their specific catalyzed reactions, are necessary for all aspects of life, enabling diverse biological processes and adaptations. Predicting enzyme functions is essential for understanding biological pathways, guiding drug development, enhancing bioproduct yields, and facilitating evolutionary studies. Addressing the inherent complexities, we introduce a new approach to annotating enzymes based on their catalyzed reactions. This method provides detailed insights into specific reactions and is adaptable to newly discovered reactions, diverging from traditional classifications by protein family or expert-derived reaction classes. We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze enzyme reaction datasets, delivering a much more refined view on the functionality of enzymes. Our evaluation leverages the largest enzyme-reaction dataset to date, derived from the SwissProt and Rhea databases with entries up to January 8, 2024. We frame the enzyme-reaction prediction as a retrieval problem, aiming to rank enzymes by their catalytic ability for specific reactions. With our model, we can recruit proteins for novel reactions and predict reactions in novel proteins, facilitating enzyme discovery and function annotation.</description>

      <title>Variable offsets and processing of implicit forms toward the adaptive synthesis and analysis of heterogeneous conforming microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of porous, lattice, or microstructure geometries has captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. Implicit forms, such as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) has captured a significant attention, recently, as tiles in lattices, partially because implicit forms have the potential for synthesizing with ease more complex topologies of tiles, compared to parametric forms. In this work, we show how variable offsets of implicit forms could be used in lattice design as well as lattice analysis, while graded wall and edge thicknesses could be fully controlled in the lattice and even vary within a single tile. As a result, (geometrically) heterogeneous lattices could be created and adapted to follow analysis results while maintaining continuity between adjacent tiles. We demonstrate this ability on several 3D models, including TPMS.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Network of Cardiovascular Diseases and Depression via Multipartite Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and depression exhibit significant comorbidity, which is highly predictive of poor clinical outcomes. Yet, the underlying biological pathways remain challenging to decipher, presumably due to the non-linear associations across multiple mechanisms. In this study, we introduced a multipartite projection method based on mutual information correlations to construct multilayer disease networks as a novel approach to explore such intricate relationships. We applied this method to a cross-sectional dataset from a wave of the Young Finns Study, which includes data on CVD and depression, along with related risk factors and two omics of biomarkers: metabolites and lipids. Rather than directly correlating CVD-related phenotypes and depressive symptoms, we extended the notion of bipartite networks to create a multipartite network, linking these phenotypes and symptoms to intermediate biological variables. Projecting from these intermediate variables results in a weighted multilayer network, where each link between CVD and depression variables is marked by its layer (i.e., metabolome or lipidome). Applying this projection method, we identified potential mediating biomarkers that connect CVD with depression. These biomarkers may therefore play significant roles in the biological pathways underlying CVD-depression comorbidity. Additionally, the network projection highlighted sex and BMI as key risk factors, or confounders, in this comorbidity. Our method is scalable to incorporate any number of omics layers and various disease phenotypes, offering a comprehensive, system-level perspective on the biological pathways contributing to comorbidity.</description>

      <title>UAMM: Price-oracle based Automated Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are pricing mechanisms utilized by decentralized exchanges (DEX). Traditional AMM approaches are constrained by pricing solely based on their own liquidity pool, without consideration of external markets or risk management for liquidity providers. In this paper, we propose a new approach known as UBET AMM (UAMM), which calculates prices by considering external market prices and the impermanent loss of the liquidity pool. Despite relying on external market prices, our method maintains the desired properties of a constant product curve when computing slippages. The key element of UAMM is determining the appropriate slippage amount based on the desired target balance, which encourages the liquidity pool to minimize impermanent loss. We demonstrate that our approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities when external market prices are efficient.</description>
