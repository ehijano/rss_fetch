      <title>Abundance Calculations of Neon Isotopes in the Predicted Lifetime of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elemental abundances of neon isotopes provide valuable insights into stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In this study, we calculate the abundances of the isotopes 18Ne, 19Ne, 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne across the five principal evolutionary phases of the Sun: hydrogen burning, lively old age, onset of rapid growth and red giant, helium burning and helium exhaustion. The calculations were carried out using the open-source nucnet-tools package, developed by the Webnucleo Group at Clemson University. Initial isotope abundances were adopted from standard proto-solar compositions. Their evolution was computed under static hydrostatic burning conditions, assuming constant temperature and density within each phase. The results show that the stable isotopes 20Ne and 22Ne remain dominant throughout the Sun's lifetime, whereas the short-lived isotopes 18Ne and 19Ne decay rapidly during or shortly after the hydrogen-burning phase. The predictions obtained for the helium burning and exhaustion phases provide quantitative neon-isotope abundances that are not extensively reported in the existing literature. These results offer valuable reference values for future studies of solar and stellar evolution, nucleosynthetic pathways, and isotopic modeling.</description>

      <title>The 2021 Hot-type Symbiotic Outburst of YY Herculis: An Optical Follow-up Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have followed up on the hot-type classical symbiotic outburst reported in YY Her using the Himalayan Chandra telescope. The outburst coincides with the secondary minima of the system. Approximately 12 similar brightening events have been reported between 1890 and 2020, with only the 1993 outburst being studied spectroscopically. In our study, we monitored the system from 2021 to 2023, covering $\sim$1.5 orbital cycles, providing an opportunity to understand the spectral evolution of the outburst over a complete orbital period of YY Her. We found that the temperature and luminosity estimations based on emission line fluxes exhibit orbital phase dependence. The values estimated at phase 0.5, corresponding to the secondary minimum, were the most reliable. The temperature of the hot component is $\approx 1.41 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}$, and the luminosity is $\approx 1020 \, L_{\odot}$ during the outburst, reduced to $\approx 1.3 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}$ and $\approx 830 \, L_{\odot}$ after one orbital cycle at phase 0.5. Temperature estimations during the outbursts suggest that YY Her exhibits both hot-type (2021) and cool-type (1993) behavior, similar to another symbiotic star, AG Dra. Using variations of the Ca II absorption lines, we confirmed the contribution of the ellipsoidal effect in secondary minima in the YY Her light curve.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of coronal dark halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18604v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At low coronal temperatures around or below 1 MK distinct areas in the surroundings of active regions (AR) show emission at a level significantly below the emission coming from the quiet Sun (QS). These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\leq$1 MK is $\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Solar Energetic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are produced in two fundamental ways: at magnetic reconnection sites in solar jets and at collisionless shock waves driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs). "Impulsive" SEP events, on open field lines from jets, have signature abundance enhancements of 3He and of increasingly heavy elements, and their outward streaming electrons drive type-III radio bursts. Similar acceleration for particles trapped on closed loops energizes solar flares. In contrast, fast, wide, CME-driven shocks accelerate seed ions from the ambient corona that grow resonant Alfven waves as they stream outward. These waves can scatter and trap lower-rigidity ions near the shock, limiting outflow, and flattening low-energy spectra upstream at the "streaming limit." Downstream, a spatially-uniform "reservoir" of SEPs is shed by the expanding shock between it and the Sun. These trapped invariant SEP spectra decrease in intensity adiabatically as the volume of the reservoir expands. Ions from the reservoir can seed further acceleration in multi-shock event and energetic proton precipitation can prolong solar gamma-ray emission. Shocks are often additionally seeded by residual impulsive ions which dominate the SEP heavy-ion abundances with their signature enhancements. As samples of the corona, SEP abundances also probe differences with the photosphere that depend upon the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements.</description>

      <title>Solar cycle irregularity study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been discovered that the time phases (time-varying delays) of the irregular periodicities observed in the Sunspot series, consisting of the approximate 27-day latitude-averaged plasma rotation and approximate 11-yr magnetic pole reversal, share a common pattern or cycle of irregularity. Because the method of measurement contains an unknown constant delay of no practical significance, the average of the measured cycle of delay is subtracted out, and the resultant cycle proceeds from zero delay to maximum delay, back to zero delay, then to maximum advance, and finally back to zero advance/delay. The period of this cycle is estimated to be 164 years, which does not allow for even one full repetition of the pattern in the 205-yr data record. So, it may or may not be a segment of an ongoing (pseudo) periodicity. Nevertheless, the fact that this cycle of irregularity in period is shared by two long-recognized genuine irregular periodicities tied to specific activity from two distinct solar phenomena suggests there is a common phenomenon affecting these periodicities. The physics-based link between the rotation speed of the interior of the Sun and the average over latitude of the rotation period of the surface plasma, approximately 27 days on average, suggests the possibility that there may be a single primary phenomenon that is responsible for irregularity of both rotation of the interior of the Sun and the period, approximately 11 yrs on average, of pole-reversal. This is consistent with recently reported (November 2025) results on hypothesized planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Fast reconnection in a coronal torn plasma sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tearing instability, also known as plasmoid instability, is an effective mechanism to speed up magnetic reconnection process, working in a wide range of magnetized plasma systems with different spatial scales, ionization degrees, and collisionality. However, due to observational limitations, observations of {plasma sheet} tearing and the resulting plasmoids are rather scarce. This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection.</description>

      <title>Variable Red Giants Exploration with MASTER Robotic Net: Main Algorithms and Study of Three Mira-type Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are discussing the capabilities of MASTER network of robotic telescopes to study variable red giant stars. We report the discovery and present archival light curves for three optical transients, connected with long period variable red giants, based on MASTER Robotic Net all-sky survey observations and archival MASTER light curves at Lomonosov database storage. We demonstrate transient detection frames and light curves for three Mira-type variables: MASTER OT $J083717.54-573411.1$, MASTER OT $J190436.33+192828.7$ and MASTER OT $J07010810-6818548$. Spectroscopically validated carbon star MASTER OT $J07010810-6818548$ shows mean magnitude growth but constant pulsation period which may indicate the presence of a long secondary period. As the result of MASTER wide-field images analysis at Lomonosov supercomputer data storage we present the 8-years historical light curves for all three objects with period calculations for all three Mira-type variables. We estimated fundamental astrophysical parameters for all three Mira-type variables: luminosities, radii, and zero age main sequence (ZAMS) masses.</description>

      <title>Long Photometric Cycles in Double Periodic Variables from Nodal Precession of a Tilted Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the long photometric cycles observed in double-periodic variables (DPVs) can arise from nodal precession of a tilted accretion disk driven by the tidal torque of the companion. Within a simple analytical framework, we derive testable relations linking the long-to-orbital period ratio to the binary mass ratio, the normalized disk size, and the disk tilt angle $\beta$, which itself can be inferred from the long-cycle amplitude, orbital inclination $i$, and disk luminosity fraction. The model naturally reproduces the two observed long-cycle light-curve morphologies -- sinusoidal and double-hump -- distinguished by the geometric criterion $i+\beta \le 90^\circ$ versus $i+\beta&gt;90^\circ$. Applying these relations to a sample of DPVs, we find that the inferred disk sizes are physically reasonable and consistent with independent light-curve modeling for a non-negligible subset of systems. Our results show that tidal nodal precession represents a viable and potentially important contributor to the long-period variability of DPVs and provide a quantitative framework for future observational and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cross-sectional Expansion on Coronal Emissions from a Radiatively Cooling Solar Flare Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop-aligned hydrodynamic modelings help better understand the thermodynamic evolution of flaring plasma confined in solar flare loops. Conventional loop modelings typically assume a uniform loop cross section. With a variation of the cross section taken into account, in this work we carry out both analytical and numerical modelings of the radiative cooling in a solar flare loop. It is found that a cross-sectional expansion with height can efficiently suppress the draining of loop material from the corona while not significantly affecting the decrease of loop temperature. Reflected to the loop energetics, the coronal part of the loop cools more dominantly by radiation, and more importantly, the loop radiative outputs are shifted toward lower temperatures. These findings pose important physical implications for extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase emissions discovered in some solar flares. The late-phase loops in these flares are believed to bear a more notable cross-sectional expansion owing to their longer lengths. Compared with the main-phase loops, the late-phase loops would emit more effectively at middle temperatures, which could, to a certain degree, mitigate the severe heating requirement for the production of a prominent warm coronal late-phase peak. In addition, the cross-sectional expansion also affects the shape of the emission lights curves, causing a sharper decay after the emission peak. Such an emission pattern has been validated with the observations of an EUV late-phase flare, and could serve as a potential diagnostic tool to judge the degree of loop cross-sectional expansion in an extended flare dataset.</description>

      <title>Observational Evidence Linking Loop Length and Thermal-Nonthermal Peak Timing in Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the magnetic loop length of solar flares relates to the timing between their thermal and nonthermal emission signatures. Our study analyzes a sample of 96 C-, M-, and X-class flares observed between 2013 and 2015 with soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and extreme UV. For each event, we determine the time delay {\Delta}t between the hard X-ray and soft X-ray peak, and estimate the flare loop length L from UV footpoints assuming a semicircular geometry. In every case, longer flare loops are consistently associated with larger timing delays. Across the full sample, we find a strong correlation, R = 0.88 between L and {\Delta}t. We also quantify how closely each flare follows the Neupert effect using a coefficient RN, defined as the Pearson correlation between the time derivative of the soft X-ray flux and the hard X-ray light curve. Applying correlation thresholds of RN &gt; 0.5 and RN &gt; 0.8 yields subsets of 87 and 46 events, respectively. In both cases, the linear relationship between loop length and peak delay remains clearly expressed. For the RN &gt; 0.5 subset, the correlation is R = 0.87, while the more selective subset with RN &gt; 0.8 displays an even stronger correlation of R = 0.91. These results show that the overall trend persists across increasingly stringent correlation thresholds. The results provide direct observational confirmation that magnetic loop geometry plays a key role in governing the temporal evolution of energy transport in solar flares.</description>

      <title>Energy and mass transport associated with impulsive spicular flows in solar coronal holes</title>

Abstract: How the solar atmosphere is heated from a temperature of about $5,000-6,000$\,K in the lower atmosphere to about $1-2$\,MK in the corona has challenged the astrophysical community for about 80 years. The same puzzle exists for the stellar coronae heating as well. In this study, we present a series of findings on solar spicules and their subsequent impact on the corona within a coronal hole environment, characterized by locally open magnetic field lines, combining insights from MHD simulations with observations. We find that the convective and turbulent motions around the solar surface cause plenty of shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere. The combined effects of shock compression and reconnection outflows then drive the formation of groups of spicules with a quasi-period of about $300$\,s and width of $\sim 200-500$\,km. The spicule upflows provide an averaged mass flux above $10^{-9}$\,kg\,m$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ in the lower corona to sustain the solar wind in coronal holes, and they continuously trigger further new local slow-mode waves and shocks. These waves supply an energy flux of $10-100$\,W\,m$^{-2}$ in the lower corona, and they are dissipated by heat conduction and compression heating to sustain the corona temperature of about $1$\,MK. The results also indicate that the upward propagating disturbances (PDs) observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands are caused by both spicule upflows and slow-mode waves and shocks. Our findings help to understand the long standing problem of coronal heating and the origin of solar winds in coronal hole regions.</description>

      <title>21,864 Unresolved, Low-mass Binaries Identified via their Overluminosity in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and a Catalog of 347,440 Systems within 100 pc of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental parameters of a low-mass star can potentially be determined from its photometry and astrometry. This is complicated by the fact that 10-20 percent of low-mass stars are predicted to be equal-mass binaries. These unresolved systems appear more luminous compared to single stars with the same fundamental parameters. We present a method to differentiate binary stars from single-star main sequence K and M dwarfs using their \textit{Gaia} DR3 XP spectra. We assemble a training set of stars which have pristine astrometry and photometry, are located within 100pc of the Sun, and exclude stars with \textit{Gaia} DR3 flags suggesting they may be unequal mass systems, thereby leaving stars that are predominantly either single- or equal-mass binaries. We then iteratively train Random Forest Regression (RFR) models to predict absolute magnitude and color given the RP spectral coefficients of a star. After each model, we remove the stars that have absolute magnitudes significantly brighter than their predicted values. This method converges on a model trained only on single stars. We then use this model to identify the ``overluminous'' K and M stars in \textit{Gaia} DR3 within 100 parsecs, with some quality cuts. We find that $\sim13\%$ of the sample is significantly overluminous and assume these to be unresolved binaries. We aggregate several multiplicity surveys across different projected separations and incorporate our overluminous binaries to create a general \textit{Catalog of Systems} within 100 pc. We use this \textit{Catalog} to provide lower limits on the multiplicity fraction for stars between $0.1$ and $0.7~M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20101v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HelioSpectrotron 5000 (HS5000) is an interactive, multi-resolution solar spectral atlas designed to facilitate direct comparison between high-resolution reference spectra and observations obtained with a wide range of ground-based instruments. Based on the Hamburg FTS atlas, the HS5000 provides both absolute intensity and continuum-normalized spectra at arbitrary spectral ranges and resolutions, as well as curated line identifications and optional telluric contamination. This framework enables rapid wavelength calibration, line identification, and context image generation.</description>

      <title>Periodic Wobble of the Post-Perihelion Jet Structure Around 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse data on the post-perihelion morphology, including jet position angles (PAs) and coma dominated photometry of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. From Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images processed with a Larson Sekanina rotational gradient filter, we measure the PAs of three main persistent jet like features between November 30 and December 27, 2025 and fit a weighted Fourier model in a period scan. The dominant jet PA wobble yields Pjet = 7.20 +/- 0.05 h. An independent Gr (R band) time-series photometry data set, using two different apertures from MPC station L92, analyzed with nightly offsets and 30 minute binning, gives Pphot = 7.136 +/- 0.001 h (formal 1sigma), with a semiamplitude A about 0.311 mag and scatter sigmajit about 0.089 mag. The close agreement beetwen the periods supports a characteristic post-perihelion period of about 7.1 h. We interpret this period as an attitude precession/nutation (non principal axis rotation) traced by jet orientation and coma flux redistribution. The jet structure precesses about the rotation axis with a characteristic angular excursion of order about 20 degs, and the rotation axis is aligned with the sunward direction to within about 20 degs.</description>

      <title>The Chemical Homogeneity of Single-Lined Spectroscopic Binaries in Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using SDSS-V DR19 Milky Way Mapper APOGEE data, we measure the impact that close binarity has on surface chemistry across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in a broad set of abundances by studying single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) in open clusters. We derive binary membership and orbital parameters for 103 SB1s by analysing APOGEE radial velocities with The Joker and UltraNest. We perform a detailed abundance analysis with BACCHUS to derive abundances in fourteen chemical species: Si, Fe, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ce, and Nd. Leveraging the assumptions of chemical homogeneity in open clusters, we compare the surface abundances of SB1s to non-binary stars at similar evolutionary states. We find that a subset of binaries with significant UV excess have a $\Delta$[C/N] that is 0.2--0.5 dex higher than expected, resulting in overestimated [C/N]-based ages for those stars. This points to pollution from an evolved companion and has implications for [C/N]-based age studies of the broader Milky Way. At the population level, we find that SB1s in our sample can be treated as statistically chemically homogeneous with their single-star counterparts, and we find no connection between orbital separation and chemical enrichment or depletion. We show that at separations up to ~5 pc, co-eval stars can be considered chemically homogeneous with one another within current abundance precisions, regardless of multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Tempawral: A Time-Resolved Retrieval Framework for Variable Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs and exoplanets are thought to host complex atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, storms, and chemical heterogeneity, akin to weather patterns on Earth. These features can produce pronounced spectral variability. Time-variability monitoring provides a unique window into surface inhomogeneities that cannot be directly resolved with foreseeable imaging technology. Current time-series analysis techniques have provided qualitative constraints on variability mechanisms but lack the ability to quantitatively estimate the extent of variation on atmospheric properties. We present Tempawral, the first data-driven time-resolved atmospheric retrieval framework that quantitatively retrieving variability in atmospheric parameters via an eigen-spectra inversion technique, leveraging the full spectra dataset. We validate this method on simulated time-series spectra of a variable brown dwarf, demonstrating that it successfully recovers key variability drivers, including inhomogeneous cloud coverage, evolving chemical abundances, and changes in temperature structure. We further showcase the utility of Tempawral by applying it to JWST/NIRISS-SOSS time-series observations of a highly variable T2.5 brown dwarf. The observed variability is best explained by a $\sim$300 K temperature perturbation near the 1-bar, accompanied by variations in the abundances of $\rm H_{2}O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm FeH$, as well as changes in the thickness of the iron cloud deck. This work provides a generalized framework for time-resolved atmospheric retrievals in the JWST era, enabling comprehensive interpretations of dynamic atmospheric processes in substellar objects.</description>

      <title>SN 2017hcc and SN 2023usc a comparative spectroscopic study of type IIn supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a spectroscopic study of the bright, nearby type-IIn supernova SN 2017hcc, and SN 2023usc using data obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). SN 2017hcc is well-studied event, and our sampling covers 7 epochs, starting from +14\,d post explosion, and continuing into the nebular stage, at +411\,d. The type-IIn event SN 2023usc was sampled over 5 epochs from +12\,d to +155\,d post explosion. The nearly featureless (except H$\alpha$) late time (+62\,d onward) spectra of SN 2023usc, suggests a novel explosion route for this type-IIn event. Assuming a CSM model created by multi-epoch ejection of material from the pre-explosion progenitor, we present here a comparative study of both events with several other type-IIn / interacting supernovae in progenitors with persistent signatures of a CSM. We find that true narrow lines ($v \ll 1000$\,km\,s$^{-1}$) emerge in the early ($\sim$ +10\,d) spectra only in few events (SN 2017hcc, SN 2023usc and SN 2010jl) initially classified as type-IIn in our sample -- in most cases the line velocity hovers at $\sim 1000$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ even in the very early epochs. CSM line velocity being indicative of its extent and opacity, this suggests that progenitors with a highly extended CSMs, which are also optically transparent in their outer regions may be relatively rare.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Pasta and Crustal Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of nuclear pasta on crustal structure and torsional oscillations using a Bayesian ensemble of unified neutron-star equations of state based on relativistic mean-field models constrained by nuclear experiments, empirical saturation properties, chiral effective field theory, and multimessenger observations. For each posterior sample, we compute the pasta sequence within a compressible liquid-drop model and quantify the onset density, thickness, and mass fraction of the pasta layers. We show that the appearance and extent of nuclear pasta are primarily controlled by the symmetry-energy slope parameter $L$. While spherical and rod-like pasta configurations are present for all equations of state, only a small fraction of the posterior supports slab, tube, or bubble geometries. The transition from spherical nuclei to rods is tightly constrained to occur at a density of $\rho_{\rm sr} = 0.0588^{+0.0045}_{-0.0065}\,\mathrm{fm^{-3}}$. We further predict that the nuclear pasta layer occupies a relative radial thickness of $\Delta R_{\rm pasta}/\Delta R_{\rm c} = 0.140^{+0.025}_{-0.036}$ and contributes a relative mass fraction of $\Delta M_{\rm pasta}/\Delta M_{\rm c} = 0.475^{+0.071}_{-0.113}$. Using the resulting crust models, we present the first quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) analysis based on a Bayesian posterior ensemble of neutron-star equations of state and systematically assess their compatibility with observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations. We find that the predicted QPO frequencies are strongly correlated with the curvature of the symmetry energy evaluated at sub-saturation density, $K_{\rm sym}(\rho_0/2)$, and that uncertainties in the equation of state translate into a range of angular indices $\ell$ consistent with the observed frequencies.</description>

      <title>Searching for and characterizing halo substructures with the GALAH DR4 survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that the Milky Way stellar halo is composed of populations of different origins, shaped by multiple accretion events. To better understand the formation of the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, we characterize the chemical and kinematic properties of halo substructures using GALAH DR4 and Gaia data. We apply wavelet transforms in the space of sqrt(J_r) and azimuthal action (L_z) to identify kinematic overdensities. Stars in the detected structures are analyzed in elemental abundance space to determine their origin. We further assess contamination using the unsupervised machine-learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), performing chemical tagging with 15 elemental abundances. We recover five structures: the Galactic disk, the Splash, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos1, and Thamnos2. GSE shows two peaks; one at sqrt(J_r) ~ 25 kpc km s^-1 is due to disk contamination, while the other above sqrt(J_r) ~ 40 kpc km s^-1 represents the cleanest GSE population. Thamnos exhibits three peaks linked to Thamnos1 and Thamnos2. Thamnos2 shows higher [alpha/Fe], iron-peak elements are enhanced in the Splash, and halo groups retain a stronger r-process signature. The multiply peaked structures suggest that the splashed disk extends beyond prograde orbits. The distinct chemo-dynamical properties of the halo groups support their extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>Exo Skryer: A JAX-accelerated sub-stellar atmospheric retrieval framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheric research relies heavily on retrieval frameworks to recover thermal and chemical properties and perform model comparison in an observational data-driven approach. However, the computational effort required for retrieval modelling has rapidly increased, driven by JWST data that covers large spectral intervals at moderate spectral resolutions, and ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy. To help tackle the computational burden faced by contemporary retrieval requirements, I present a new sub-stellar atmosphere retrieval modelling framework, Exo Skryer, that utilises the JAX library for Python to enable scalable, computationally efficient forward modelling as well as posterior sampling. I present example retrievals for pre- and current JWST era observations for both transmission and emission spectra, finding consistent results to previous retrieval modelling efforts, apart from a WASP-107b test case. In addition, I present a new method to directly retrieve the real and imaginary optical constants (n, k) of suspected aerosol infrared absorption features. Due to its computational expediency, Exo Skryer will be highly suited for future demanding retrieval efforts that incorporate more spatial dimensionality, complex forward models and high-dimensional parameter sets.</description>

      <title>The morphological stability of open clusters: a new 2D perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19746v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) usually evolve gradually as the number of their members changes, which can be manifested in their morphological characteristics. We aim to investigate the morphological stability of 1,490 OCs and further explore the potential change of morphological stability of the OCs at different spatial positions, using the OC catalog from the literature. We define for the first time a new morphological stability parameter Ncore/Nouter, a ratio of member numbers between cluster core and outer areas within tidal radii, which has a significant positive correlation against N, with a slope of 1.140$\pm$0.039, significantly steeper than the 0.720$\pm$0.026 measured for Score/Souter. This demonstrates that the stellar density in the core is a more sensitive tracer for morphological stability than geometry. Spatially, the radial sample OCs have larger slopes of Ncore/Nouter and Score/Souter against N, with 1.083$\pm$0.116 and 0.733$\pm$0.080, respectively, whereas those in the tangential direction 1.013$\pm$0.110 and 0.529$\pm$0.075, respectively, which means that the impact on sample OCs from tidal forces directed toward the Galactic center is possibly stronger than that from the shear force caused by the differential rotation of the Galactic disk. Besides, the sample OCs younger than 30 Myr display a shallow slope of 0.751$\pm$0.166, with those older than 800 Myr (1.442$\pm$0.128), reflecting that young OCs likely endure both internal disruptions, such as early dynamical heating weakening core binding and more severe external disturbances, compared to older OCs.</description>

      <title>Probing the Milky Way Halo with RR Lyrae Stars from Gaia Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) stellar halo, containing debris from past accretion events, serves as a fossil record of hierarchical mass assembly. Due to their distinct properties, RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) serve as excellent tracers for identifying and characterising the halo's substructures. We analysed a sample of 4933 RRLs, for which we calculated the integrals of motion and orbital parameters. We applied the domain-informed novelty detection CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries (CLiMB) framework to identify RRL membership in the MW substructures. We analysed the metallicity distributions of RRLs in major accreted system remnants as a snapshot of their chemical evolutionary status during early epochs. We calculated the weighted mean metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the corresponding standard deviation for Gaia Sausage/Enceladus ([Fe/H] = $-1.57 \pm 0.25$ dex), Sequoia ([Fe/H] =$ -1.64\pm0.26$ dex), and the Helmi streams ([Fe/H] = $-1.66\pm0.19$ dex). The metallicity distribution of RRLs in Thamnos was found to be bimodal, with the metal-poor peak likely representing the genuine accreted Thamnos population ([Fe/H] = $-1.94\pm0.20$ dex), in agreement with recent works based on spectroscopic abundances. Our analysis shows that the substructures ED-1 and L-RL3 are highly contaminated by thick disc stars. However, the metal-poor tails in their metallicity distributions may be signatures of remnants from small accreted systems. We also identify over-densities of RRLs in correspondence with the recently reported substructures Shiva and Shakti, which we suggest are of in-situ origin. Finally, we applied the RRL-based mass-metallicity relation of galaxies to test the nature of the identified dynamical substructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the evolution of optical spectra and lightcurves of the fast nova V1674 Herculis during 150 days past its eruption. Using the post-eruption AAVSO light curve, we have calculated the orbital period of V1674 Her to be 0.153 days. There is no unambiguous white dwarf spin period in our data. The optical spectra show that the ionisation increases with time. A morpho-kinematic analysis of the H$\alpha$ line profile indicates a bipolar morphology with polar blobs and an equatorial ring. Lyman beta fluorescence is found to be the dominant mechanism for the excitation of neutral oxygen. On day 19.87, [Ne III] &amp; [Ne V] lines are present, indicating the presence of the ONe white dwarf. On day 147.66, the nebular lines are still present, implying that the nova had not gone into quiescence yet; this spectrum is accretion-dominated.</description>

      <title>Why Do Stars Turn Red? I. Post-Main-Sequence Expansion Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we address the long-standing question of why post-main-sequence stars expand into red giants (RGs) or red supergiants (RSGs). This paper aims to identify the key physical mechanism that drives stellar evolution toward the RG/RSG phase. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we perform controlled numerical experiments by systematically varying stellar parameters in evolutionary models, and compare those that successfully evolve into RG/RSGs and those that do not. We show that envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase cannot be explained by energy absorption. Instead, it is governed by a refined form of the "mirror principle," in which the stellar envelope responds oppositely to its inner boundary, defined by the outer edge of the hydrogen-burning shell, rather than directly to the helium core. This behavior arises naturally from hydrostatic equilibrium, as the burning shell establishes a moving, nearly constant-pressure inner boundary for the envelope. We identify two evolutionary pathways toward the RG/RSG phase that both follow this refined mirror principle: (1) direct envelope expansion during helium-core contraction, and (2) continued expansion after contraction ceases, driven by a decline in nuclear energy generation rate. The final approach to the RG/RSG phase is marked by a structural transition in the envelope, characterized by mass redistribution and the development of an extended convective region. We present a unified physical framework for envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase, based on the refined mirror principle and the final structural transition, and outline an evolutionary roadmap leading to the RG/RSG phase.</description>

      <title>Why Do Stars Turn Red? II. Steady-State Envelope Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical origin of red giants (RGs) and red supergiants (RSGs) remains a fundamental question in stellar astrophysics. In Paper II of this series, we investigate the physical mechanisms governing envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase by systematically exploring the physically realizable configurations of stellar envelopes. We construct steady-state stellar envelope models by solving the time-independent stellar structure equations while neglecting the core. The inner boundary is defined by a fixed pressure condition motivated by MESA stellar evolution models presented in Paper I. Our models show three key features of envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase. (1) The refined mirror principle identified in Paper I is recovered: the post-main-sequence stellar radius varies inversely with the radius of the envelope's inner boundary, arising purely from hydrostatic equilibrium. (2) We identify an upper limit to envelope expansion corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim 4000,{\rm K}$, characteristic of RG/RSG stars and consistent with the Hayashi limit. This temperature limit is regulated by H$^{-}$ opacity, whose sharp decline at low temperatures flattens the surface temperature gradient and drives a structural transition. (3) The yellow regime of intermediate radius corresponds to an instability zone, in which small displacements of the hydrogen-burning shell produce large variations in stellar radius, naturally accounting for the bifurcation of giants and supergiants into blue and red branches instead of remaining in the yellow regime.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C-MetaLL) survey: IX. Metallicity dependence of Period-Wesenheit relations based on a homogeneous spectroscopic sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17447v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The C-MetaLL project has provided homogeneous spectroscopic abundances of 290 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) for which we have the intensity-averaged magnitudes in multiple optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, periods, pulsation modes, and Gaia parallaxes. Our goal is to derive updated period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters -- including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction -- and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\gamma \approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\sim$10 $\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\gamma|$ and reduces $\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.</description>

      <title>Constraining properties of dust formed in Wolf-Rayet binary WR 112 using mid-infrared and millimeter observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binaries that host a carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) star and an OB-type companion can be copious dust producers. Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.</description>

      <title>Fading into darkness: A weak mass ejection and low-efficiency fallback accompanying black hole formation in M31-2014-DS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ of gas expanding at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\lesssim1.5\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.</description>

      <title>BE Lyncis: A Pulsating Star in the Most Eccentric Binary with a Massive Unseen Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an exceptionally eccentric binary system, BE Lyncis (BE Lyn), which hosts a compact companion with mass $\gtrsim 2.5~M_{\odot}$. By combining \textit{TESS} photometry with an extensive set of times of maximum light spanning 39 years, we identify BE Lyn as a high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti star in a binary with an orbital period of $\approx15.9$ years and an extraordinary eccentricity of $e=0.9989^{+0.0008}_{-0.0021}$ ($&gt;0.9968$ at 95% confidence) -- the most extreme eccentricity reliably measured for any binary system. Dynamical constraints limit the orbital inclination to $i \lesssim 10.1^{\circ}$, implying a companion mass $M_2 \gtrsim 2.5~M_{\odot}$, which spans the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. If the companion is a neutron star, it would be the most massive known; if a black hole, it would be the closest to Earth. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, as well as the formation and evolution of extremely eccentric binaries. Our work demonstrates the use of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating star to reveal a compact companion, offering a novel method for detecting black holes in non-interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectra of methane-containing ice mixtures for JWST data analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds, and it is a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on the low temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited.
  Aims. We obtained spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compared them to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars in early stages. We also tested whether the data we obtained can be applied to interpret JWST data.
  Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained with the ISEAge setup via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $\chi^2$ minimization was used for the fitting.
  Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O, CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, and CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K. They show an increase of 20% in mixtures compared to the commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also tested whether the spectra can be used on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II.
  Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments that enable a more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra is publicly available on Zenodo and can be used for fitting JWST data.</description>

      <title>The Montreal Open Clusters and Associations (MOCA) Database: A Census of Nearby Associations, Open Clusters, and Young Substellar Objects within 500 pc of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Montreal Open Clusters and Associations database (MOCAdb), a public MySQL database with a Python interface. MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $\Sigma$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $\Sigma$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized. We bring the total of candidate isolated planetary-mass objects to 101, 53 of which are newly recognized candidate members.</description>

      <title>Investigating Nonlinear Quenching Effects on Polar Field Buildup in the Sun Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $\Delta D_{\mathrm{LQ}}/\Delta D_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.</description>

      <title>Non-conservative Mass Transfer as a Formation Channel for Gaia Black Hole System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detected Gaia systems hosting compact objects challenge standard models of binary star evolution. In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, they are expected to have undergone a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal masses, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to a stellar merger or a short-period binary. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. Using detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether non-conservative mass transfer, in which most of the mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from standard isotropic re-emission from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss geometry model reproduces the orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well over a wide range of initial conditions, offering a plausible formation pathway. We speculate this may point to enhanced eruptive mass loss, potentially driven by high-opacity subsurface layers in the donor prior to Roche-lobe overflow, consistent with preferentially bipolar outflows observed in luminous blue variables. Alternatively, it may indicate the need for more sophisticated mass-transfer prescriptions that account for highly unequal Roche-lobe sizes, sub-synchronous rotation, and possible self-accretion. Similar mechanisms may operate in other post-mass-transfer systems facing analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron-star and white-dwarf binaries, stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Exploring the formation mechanisms of tidal structures in globular clusters of extragalactic origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal structures around globular clusters provide valuable insights into cluster evolution and the hierarchical assembly of the Milky Way. Using wide-field imaging data from the DESI Legacy Survey combined with a color-magnitude matched-filter technique, we perform a systematic analysis of extra-tidal features in 28 Galactic globular clusters of likely extragalactic origin, representing the largest homogeneous sample examined in this context to date. The clusters display diverse morphologies: 12 exhibit tidal tails, 9 show diffuse envelopes, and 7 reveal no clear extra-tidal features. Notably, we report the first detection of an extended tidal structure around the Sagittarius-associated cluster Terzan 7. To explore the underlying drivers, we compare intrinsic properties, orbital dynamics, and possible accretion associations across morphological groups. From the parameter distributions, complemented by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that total mass, escape velocity, concentration, tidal filling factor, pericentric radius, eccentricity and radial angle in action-angle coordinates are all likely group-sensitive parameters. These results suggest that both internal cluster properties and orbital configurations play important roles in shaping extra-tidal morphologies. In addition, the cluster's accretion history shows no clear correlation with the presence of tidal features, indicating that it is not a direct driver of outer structure formation. Overall, the diversity of tidal structures is unlikely to be governed by a single factor, but instead reflects the interplay between internal dynamical evolution and the external Galactic environment. This study provides the most comprehensive constraints so far on the physical processes driving extra-tidal structures in accreted globular clusters.</description>

      <title>On flying near the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>

Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe encounter 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density (25,000 per cubic centimeter) and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity (200 kilometers per second) and ion temperature (25 electron Volts) were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed near the base of a pseudo-streamer. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. This field is not associated with an ExB drift because it is observed in the plasma rest frame. Instead, it is balanced by the Generalized Ohm's Law terms whose current dependent term associated with this electric field was less than 1 milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. The region also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the Generalized Ohm's Law could be significant. In addition, both the density and electric field had non-zero slopes as functions of time, suggesting that the pressure gradient term in the Generalized Ohm's Law also mattered. This large electric field in the plasma rest frame may be the first and largest such field ever reported.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as Globular Clusters in Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($&gt;10^4$ M$_\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast$/$M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.</description>
