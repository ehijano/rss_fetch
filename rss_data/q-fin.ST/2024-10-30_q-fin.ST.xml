      <title>Achilles, Neural Network to Predict the Gold Vs US Dollar Integration with Trading Bot for Automatic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the stock market is a big challenge for the machine learning world. It is known how difficult it is to have accurate and consistent predictions with ML models. Some architectures are able to capture the movement of stocks but almost never are able to be launched to the production world. We present Achilles, with a classical architecture of LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) neural network this model is able to predict the Gold vs USD commodity. With the predictions minute-per-minute of this model we implemented a trading bot to run during 23 days of testing excluding weekends. At the end of the testing period we generated $1623.52 in profit with the methodology used. The results of our method demonstrate Machine Learning can successfully be implemented to predict the Gold vs USD commodity.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of Conditional Mean and Covariance for Unbalanced Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric kernel-based estimator of cross-sectional conditional mean and covariance matrices for large unbalanced panels. We show its consistency and provide finite-sample guarantees. In an empirical application, we estimate conditional mean and covariance matrices for a large unbalanced panel of monthly stock excess returns given macroeconomic and firm-specific covariates from 1962 to 2021.The estimator performs well with respect to statistical measures. It is informative for empirical asset pricing, generating conditional mean-variance efficient portfolios with substantial out-of-sample Sharpe ratios far beyond equal-weighted benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Stock Price Prediction Approach Based on Time Series Decomposition and Multi-Scale CNN using OHLCT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning in stock prediction has become an important branch. Image-based methods show potential by capturing complex visual patterns and spatial correlations, offering advantages in interpretability over time series models. However, image-based approaches are more prone to overfitting, hindering robust predictive performance. To improve accuracy, this paper proposes a novel method, named Sequence-based Multi-scale Fusion Regression Convolutional Neural Network (SMSFR-CNN), for predicting stock price movements in the China A-share market.
  By utilizing CNN to learn sequential features and combining them with image features, we improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction on the A-share market stock dataset. This approach reduces the search space for image features, stabilizes, and accelerates the training process. Extensive comparative experiments on 4,454 A-share stocks show that the model achieves a 61.15% positive predictive value and a 63.37% negative predictive value for the next 5 days, resulting in a total profit of 165.09%.</description>
