      <title>Large Language Model-Augmented Auto-Delineation of Treatment Target Volume in Radiation Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most effective treatments for cancer, and its success relies on the accurate delineation of targets. However, target delineation is a comprehensive medical decision that currently relies purely on manual processes by human experts. Manual delineation is time-consuming, laborious, and subject to interobserver variations. Although the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significantly enhanced the auto-contouring of normal tissues, accurate delineation of RT target volumes remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a visual language model-based RT target volume auto-delineation network termed Radformer. The Radformer utilizes a hierarichal vision transformer as the backbone and incorporates large language models to extract text-rich features from clinical data. We introduce a visual language attention module (VLAM) for integrating visual and linguistic features for language-aware visual encoding (LAVE). The Radformer has been evaluated on a dataset comprising 2985 patients with head-and-neck cancer who underwent RT. Metrics, including the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IOU), and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), were used to evaluate the performance of the model quantitatively. Our results demonstrate that the Radformer has superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art models, validating its potential for adoption in RT practice.</description>

      <title>Electrical Impedance Tomography Based Closed-loop Tumor Treating Fields in Dynamic Lung Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a non-invasive anticancer modality that utilizes alternating electric fields to disrupt cancer cell division and growth. While generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects, traditional TTFields therapy for lung tumors faces challenges due to the influence of respiratory motion. We design a novel closed-loop TTFields strategy for lung tumors by incorporating electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for real-time respiratory phase monitoring and dynamic parameter adjustments. Furthermore, we conduct theoretical analysis to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using the lung motion model. Compared to conventional TTFields settings, we observed that variations in the electrical conductivity of lung during different respiratory phases led to a decrease in the average electric field intensity within lung tumors, transitioning from end-expiratory (1.08 V/cm) to end-inspiratory (0.87 V/cm) phases. Utilizing our proposed closed-Loop TTFields approach at the same dose setting (2400 mA, consistent with the traditional TTFields setting), we can achieve a higher and consistent average electric field strength at the tumor site (1.30 V/cm) across different respiratory stages. Our proposed closed-loop TTFields method has the potential to improved lung tumor therapy by mitigating the impact of respiratory motion.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation from the IFCN-endorsed ITRUSST Consortium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-intensity Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique enabling cortical and deep brain targeting with unprecedented spatial accuracy. Given the high rate of adoption by new users with varying levels of expertise and interdisciplinary backgrounds, practical guidelines are needed to ensure state-of-the-art TUS application and reproducible outcomes. Therefore, the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) consortium has formed a subcommittee, endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), to develop recommendations for best practice in TUS applications in humans. The practical guide presented here provides a brief introduction into ultrasound physics and sonication parameters. It explains the requirements of TUS lab equipment and transducer selection and discusses experimental design and procedures alongside potential confounds and control conditions. Finally, the guide elaborates on essential steps of application planning for stimulation safety and efficacy, as well as considerations when combining TUS with neuroimaging, electrophysiology, or other brain stimulation techniques. We hope that this practical guide to TUS will assist both novice and experienced users in planning and conducting high-quality studies and provide a solid foundation for further advancements in this promising field.</description>

      <title>Motion simulation of radio-labeled cells in whole-body positron emission tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell tracking is a subject of active research gathering great interest in medicine and biology. Positron emission tomography (PET) is well suited for tracking radio-labeled cells in vivo due to its exceptional sensitivity and whole-body capability. For validation, ground-truth data is desirable that realistically mimics the flow of cells in a clinical situation. This study develops a workflow (CeFloPS) for simulating moving radio-labeled cells in a human phantom. From the XCAT phantom, the blood vessels are reduced to nodal networks along which cells can move and distribute to organs and tissues. The movement is directed by the blood flow which is calculated in each node using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation and Kirchhoffs laws assuming laminar flow. Organs are voxelized and movement of cells from artery entry to vein exit is generated via a biased 3D random walk. The probabilities of whether cells move or stay in tissues are derived from rate constants of physiologically based compartment modeling. PET listmode data is generated using the Monte-Carlo simulation framework GATE based on the definition of a large-body PET scanner with cell paths as moving radioactive sources and the XCAT phantom providing attenuation data. From the flow simulation of 10000 cells, 100 sample cells were further processed by GATE and listmode data was reconstructed into images for comparison. As demonstrated by comparisons of simulated and reconstructed cell distributions, CeFloPS can realistically simulate the cell behavior of whole-body PET providing valuable data for development and validation of cell tracking algorithms.</description>

      <title>Functional Assessment of Cerebral Capillaries using Single Capillary Reporters in Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain's microvascular cerebral capillary network plays a vital role in maintaining neuronal health, yet capillary dynamics are still not well understood due to limitations in existing imaging techniques. Here, we present Single Capillary Reporters (SCaRe) for transcranial Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM), a novel approach enabling non-invasive, whole-brain mapping of single capillaries and estimates of their transit-time as a neurovascular biomarker. We accomplish this first through computational Monte Carlo and ultrasound simulations of microbubbles flowing through a fully-connected capillary network. We unveil distinct capillary flow behaviors which informs methodological changes to ULM acquisitions to better capture capillaries in vivo. Subsequently, applying SCaRe-ULM in vivo, we achieve unprecedented visualization of single capillary tracks across brain regions, analysis of layer-specific capillary heterogeneous transit times (CHT), and characterization of whole microbubble trajectories from arterioles to venules. Lastly, we evaluate capillary biomarkers using injected lipopolysaccharide to induce systemic neuroinflammation and track the increase in SCaRe-ULM CHT, demonstrating the capability to detect subtle capillary functional changes. SCaRe-ULM represents a significant advance in studying microvascular dynamics, offering novel avenues for investigating capillary patterns in neurological disorders and potential diagnostic applications.</description>
