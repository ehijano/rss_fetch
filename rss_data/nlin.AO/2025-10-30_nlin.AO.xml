      <title>Finite Population Dynamics Resolve the Central Paradox of the Inspection Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Inspection Game is the canonical model for the strategic conflict between law enforcement (inspectors) and citizens (potential criminals), but its classical analysis is crippled by a paradox: the equilibrium crime rate is found to be independent of both the penalty size ($p$) and the crime gain ($g$). This result severely undermines the policy relevance of the static model, suggesting fines are futile. To resolve this paradox, we employ evolutionary game theory and analyze the long-term fixation probabilities of strategies using finite population dynamics. Our results fundamentally demonstrate that high absolute penalties $p$ are highly effective at suppressing crime by driving the system toward the criminal extinction absorbing state, thereby restoring the intuitive role of $p$. Furthermore, we reveal a U-shaped policy landscape where both high penalties and light penalties (where $p \approx g$) are successful suppressors, maximizing criminal risk at intermediate deterrence levels. Most critically, we analyze the realistic asymptotic limit of extreme population asymmetry, where inspectors are exceedingly rare. In this limit, the system's dynamic outcome is entirely decoupled from the citizen payoff parameters $p$ and $g$, and is instead determined by the initial frequency of crime ($x_0$) relative to the deterrence threshold (the ratio of inspection cost to reward for catching a criminal). We find the highly counter-intuitive result of the dominance of the initially rare strategy: crime becomes fixed if $x_0$ is below this threshold, but goes extinct if $x_0$ is above it. These findings highlight the need to move beyond deterministic predictions and emphasize that effective deterrence requires managing demographic noise and initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the puzzles left open by energetic analyses of irreversible stochastic processes is that boundary conditions that prevent the performance of work or the dissipation of heat make no contribution to an entropy-production budget; yet we see ubiquitously in both engineered and living systems that both transient and persistent energy costs are paid to create and maintain such boundaries. We wish to know whether there are inherent limits for the costs of such phenomena, and common units in which those can be traded off against more familiar costs measured in terms of heat dissipation. We give this problem a concrete framing in the context of CRNs, for the problem of extracting a topologically restricted pathway from a larger distributed network, through activation of some reactions and selective elimination of others. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a NESS, and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we make use of their formal equivalence to electrical circuits. We prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. For small CRNs, we show how catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms can drastically alter pathway costs, enabling unfavorable pathways to become favorable and approach the cost of the hosting pathway. Our results provide insights into the thermodynamic principles governing open CRNs and offer a foundation for understanding the evolution of metabolic networks.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.</description>

      <title>Self-organized epithelial reticulum inhibits cell proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. Within the epithelial layer arises a self-organized reticulum comprising two interpenetrating multiscale networks: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells embedded within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of these networks was found to be susceptible to specific mechanical and molecular stimuli. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that is well-captured by network theory, and implies self-organization and proximity to criticality. Thus, the findings demonstrate a completely new biological paradigm - reticular inhibition of proliferation (RIP).</description>
