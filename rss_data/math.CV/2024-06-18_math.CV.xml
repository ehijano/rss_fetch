      <title>Stability Theory for Matrix Polynomials in One and Several Variables with Extensions of Classical Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The file contains PhD Dissertation by Oskar Jakub Szyma\'nski. This work ends his study at Doctoral School of Exact and Natural Sciences at Jagiellonian University where the Author has attended in years 2019-2024. The subject of the Thesis is the stability theory developed for matrix polynomials. The main concept described in the Dissertation is hyperstability with respect to an open or closed subset of the complex plane. The notion of hyperstability is a contribution of the Author of the Thesis. Disseration is devoted mostly to regular polynomials, singular polynomials play marginal role in the Thesis. The Author of the Thesis has discovered several interesting results extending classical theorems from complex analysis. These are for example: multi-variable Gauss-Lucas theorem for matrix polynomials and Sz\'asz-type inequalities for matrix norms such as the matrix two-norm and the Frobenius norm.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's tenth problem for rings of holomorphic functions of bounded order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main open problems in the context of extensions of Hilbert's tenth problem (HTP) is the case of the ring of complex entire functions in one variable. Our main result provides a step towards an answer: For every $\rho\ge 0$, we give a negative solution to the analogue of HTP in the ring of complex entire functions in one variable of growth order at most $\rho$.</description>

      <title>On the theory of pseudo-balayage on a locally compact space and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under suitable requirements on a kernel on a locally compact space, we develop a theory of inner (outer) pseudo-balayage of quite general signed Radon measures (not necessarily of finite energy) onto quite general sets (not necessarily closed). Such investigations were initiated in Fuglede's work (Anal. Math., 2016), which was, however, mainly concerned with the outer pseudo-balayage of positive measures of finite energy, whereas treatment of signed measures of infinite energy requires essentially new methods and approaches. To illustrate this, it is enough to note that in the particular case of kernels satisfying the balayage principle, the pseudo-balayage of positive measures coincides with their balayage, whereas for signed measures, these two concepts are drastically different. The theory thereby established enables us to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the inner Gauss variational problem, a point of interest for a number of recent researches in constructive function theory. This study covers many interesting kernels in classical and modern potential theory, which looks promising for further applications.</description>

      <title>Complex variable solution on noncircular and asymmetrical tunnelling embedded by bidirectional conformal mapping incorporating Charge Simulation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical issues of noncircular and asymmetrical tunnelling can be estimated using complex variable method with suitable conformal mapping. Exsiting solution schemes of conformal mapping for noncircular tunnel generally need iteration or optimization strategy, and are thereby mathematically complicated. This paper proposes a new bidirectional conformal mapping for deep and shallow tunnels of noncircular and asymmetrical shapes by incorporating Charge Simulation Method. The solution scheme of this new bidirectional conformal mapping only involves a pair of linear systems, and is therefore logically straight-forward, computationally efficient, and practically easy in coding. New numerical strategies are developed to deal with possible sharp corners of cavity by small arc simulation and densified collocation points. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the geometrical usage of the new bidirectional conformal mapping. Furthermore, the new bidirectional conformal mapping is embedded into two complex variable solutions of noncircular and asymmetrical shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement. The respective result comparisons with finite element solution and exsiting analytical solution show good agreements, indicating the feasible mechanical usage of the new bidirectional conformal mapping.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ regularity of the Bergman projection on the symmetrized polydisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $L^p$ regularity of the Bergman projection $P$ over the symmetrized polydisc in $\mathbb C^n$. We give a decomposition of the Bergman projection on the polydisc and obtain an operator equivalent to the Bergman projection over anti-symmetric function spaces. Using it, we obtain the $L^p$ irregularity of $P$ for $p=\frac{2n}{n-1}$ which also implies that $P$ is $L^p$ bounded if and only if $p\in (\frac{2n}{n+1},\frac{2n}{n-1})$.</description>

      <title>On the Existence and Smoothness of the Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a smooth solution of the Navier-Stokes Equation by studying the iteration of a product defined over a space of functions dominated by Fourier caloric functions decreasing fast. Additionally, we show the existence of a curve of entire vector fields of order 2 that extends the solution to the complex domain for positive time.</description>
