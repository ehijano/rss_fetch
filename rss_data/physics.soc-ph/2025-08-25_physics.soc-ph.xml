      <title>Universality and Invariance in Hegselmann-Krause Opinion Dynamics: Proof of Three Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three conjectures from [R. Hegselmann, The Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulations 26(4), 11 (2023)] about the Hegselmann-Krause opinion dynamics and the structure of $\epsilon$-switches are proved. The first conjecture states that the number of $\epsilon$-switches for any given initial opinion distribution is always finite, guaranteeing that the algorithm for enumerating them terminates. The second conjecture concerns the relationship between the dynamics of two consecutive $\epsilon$-switches, showing that the opinion evolution is identical up to the switch time. The third conjecture establishes the invariance of the dynamics under positive-affine transformations of the initial distribution, with a corresponding rescaling of all $\epsilon$-switch values. Together, these results provide a formal foundation for the empirical observations reported in the literature and offer a step towards a systematic classification of BC-processes based on their initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Planning for future EV charging infrastructure: A city-scale assessment of demand and capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16175v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global shift toward transportation electrification has accelerated, capacity planning for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has become a critical challenge in the development of low-carbon urban energy systems. This study proposes the first demand-driven, multi-objective planning model for optimizing city-scale capacity allocation of EV charging infrastructure. The model employs a bottom-up approach to estimate charging demand differentiated by vehicle type-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chongqing, a rapidly expanding EV hub in China with a strong industrial base, supportive policies, and diverse urban morphologies, is selected as the case study. The results show that (1) monthly EV electricity consumption in Chongqing rose from 18.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in June 2022 to 57.5 GWh in December 2024, with associated carbon emissions increasing from 9.9 kilotons of carbon dioxide (ktCO2) to 30 ktCO2, driven primarily by BEVs; (2) 181,622 additional charging piles were installed between 2022 and 2024, concentrated in densely populated areas, reflecting a demand-responsive strategy that prioritizes population density over geographic coverage; and (3) between 2025 and 2030, EV electricity demand is projected to reach 1940 GWh, with the number of charging piles exceeding 1.4 million, and charging demand from EREVs and PHEVs expected to overtake BEVs later in the period. While Chongqing serves as the pilot area, the proposed planning platform is adaptable for application in cities worldwide, enabling cross-regional comparisons under diverse socio-economic, geographic, and policy conditions. Overall, this work offers policymakers a versatile tool to support sustainable, cost-effective EV infrastructure deployment aligned with low-carbon electrification targets in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>Harmonious Color Pairings: Insights from Human Preference and Natural Hue Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues, enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent, challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Approximation of Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world phenomena can be modelled as dynamical processes on networks, a prominent example being the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Mean-field approximations are a widely used tool to analyse such dynamical processes on networks, but these are typically derived using plausible probabilistic reasoning, introducing uncontrolled errors that may lead to invalid mathematical conclusions. In this paper we present a rigorous approach to derive mean-field approximations from the exact description of Markov chain dynamics on networks through a process of averaging called approximate lumping. We consider a general class of Markov chain dynamics on networks in which each vertex can adopt a finite number of ``vertex-states'' (e.g. susceptible, infected, recovered etc.), and transition rates depend on the number of neighbours of each type. Our approximate lumping is based on counting the number of each type of vertex-state in subsets of vertices, and this results in a density dependent population process. In the large graph limit, this reduces to a low dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, special cases of which are well known mean-field approximations. Our approach provides a general framework for the derivation of mean-field approximations of dynamics on networks that unifies previously disconnected approaches and highlights the sources of error.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian framework for opinion dynamics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Bayesian framework that unifies a wide class of opinion dynamics models. In this framework, an individual's opinion on a topic is the expected value of their belief, represented as a random variable with a prior distribution. Upon receiving a signal, modeled as the prior belief plus a bias term and subject to zero-mean noise with a known distribution, the individual updates their belief distribution via Bayes' rule. By systematically varying the prior, bias, and noise distributions, this approach recovers a broad array of opinion dynamics models, including DeGroot, bounded confidence, bounded shift, and models exhibiting overreaction or backfire effects. Our analysis shows that the signal score is the key determinant of each model's mathematical structure, governing both small- and large-signal behavior. All models converge to DeGroot's linear update rule for small signals, but diverge in their tail behavior for large signals. This unification not only reveals theoretical linkages among previously disconnected models but also provides a systematic method for generating new ones, offering insights into the rational foundations of opinion formation under cognitive constraints.</description>

      <title>Explaining human cooperation through a dual mechanism of individual and social learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation on social networks is crucial for understanding human survival and development. Although network structure has been found to significantly influence cooperation, human experiments have observed different cooperation phenomena under similar conditions. While evidence suggests that these differences arise from human exploration, our understanding of its impact mechanisms and characteristics remains limited. Here, we seek to formalize human exploration as an individual learning process involving trial and reflection, and integrate social learning to examine how their interdependence shapes cooperation. We find that individual learning can alter neighbor imitation tendencies, and the resulting shifts in the local cooperative environment feed back into the experiential cognition that guides individual learning. This coupled dynamic makes the ability of social networks to promote cooperation largely dependent on whether individuals focus on long-term payoffs, and exhibits a series of characteristics that can explain previously unexplained and seemingly contradictory cooperation phenomena. Surprisingly, individual learning can promote cooperation more than social learning when its probability is negatively correlated with payoffs, a mechanism rooted in the psychological tendency to avoid trial-and-error when individuals are satisfied with their current payoffs. These results explain the contradictory cooperation phenomenon by accounting for decision preferences and cognitive processes underlying exploration, bridging the gap between theoretical research and reality.</description>
