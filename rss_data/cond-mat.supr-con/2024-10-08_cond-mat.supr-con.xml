      <title>Density functional theory based investigation of heavy fermion band candidates in triplet superconductor UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compound UTe2 is of great recent interest as a spin triplet superconductor that is thought to realize a topologically nontrivial superconducting order parameter. Though UTe2 is considered to be a heavy fermion material, only light-electron Fermi surfaces have been compellingly identified, while a possible heavy electron Fermi surface near the momentum space Z-point has been the subject of more speculative and incongruent interpretations based on density functional theory (DFT+U) and experimental measurements. Here we explore the DFT+U band structure within a tight binding model framework to identify emergence mechanisms for heavy fermion Fermi surfaces. Applying a Gutzweiller-like renormalization term to f-electron kinetics is found to distort the lowest energy f electron band from a saddle point to a local minimum at the Z-point, introducing a shallow Fermi pocket and greatly improving compatibility with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Fluctuations with Enhanced Superconductivity at the Proposed Nematic Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum critical point (QCP) represents a continuous phase transition at absolute zero. At the QCP of an unconventional superconductor, enhanced superconducting transition temperature and magnetic fluctuations strength are often observed together, indicating magnetism-mediated superconductivity. This raises the question of whether quantum fluctuations in other degrees of freedom, such as charge, could similarly boost superconductivity. However, because charge is frequently intertwined with magnetism, isolating and understanding its specific role in Cooper pair formation poses a significant challenge. Here, we report persistent charge density fluctuations (CDF) down to 15 K in the non-magnetic superconductor Sr$_{0.77}$Ba$_{0.23}$Ni$_{2}$As$_{2}$, which lies near a proposed nematic QCP associated with a six-fold enhancement of superconductivity. Our results show that the quasi-elastic CDF does not condense into resolution-limited Bragg peaks and displays non-saturated strength. The CDF completely softens at 25 K, with its critical behavior described by the same mathematical framework as the antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid model, yielding a fitted Curie-Weiss temperature of $\theta \approx 0$ K. Additionally, we find that the nematic fluctuations are not lattice-driven, as evidenced by the absence of softening in nematic-coupled in-plane transverse acoustic phonons. Our discovery positions Sr$_{x}$Ba$_{1-x}$Ni$_{2}$As$_{2}$ as a promising candidate for charge-fluctuation-driven nematicity and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Electronic Band Structure of Single-layer and Bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper Nickelates Probed by in-situ High Pressure X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of electronic band structure for single-layer (SL) and bilayer (BL) RP-nickelates probed by in-situ HP X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). At ambient pressure (AP), the energy splitting delta_E of d_3z^2-r^2 and d_x^2-y^2 bands are directly observed in La3Ni2O7 (BL-La327) but not in La2NiO4 (SL-La214) above E_F, underlining the critical role of inner apical O atoms. A combination of DFT-based electronic band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) calculations with simulated XANES enables us to explain the observed main XANES features labelled by a, A, B', B and C when considering the orbital hybridizations, crystal field splitting (CFS) and core-hole screening of different 3d configurations for SL-La214 and BL-La327 nickelates. At high pressure (HP), the delta_E values of pre-edge peak form a dome-like evolution above 7.7 GPa with the maximum locating at around 20 GPa for metallic BL-La327. Analysis of its integrated area and FWHM provides strong evidence that the bonding d_3z^2-r^2 band crosses E_F above about 7.7 GPa for the metallic BL-La327. Growth of integrated area of pre-edge peak and C peak further evidences pressure-induced hole doping effect. Meanwhile, the pressure dependent FWHM of pre-edge peak implies a nonmonotonic evolution of orbital-selective electronic correlation above 7.7 GPa with extrema emerging at about 20 GPa. Moreover, we estimate the relative hole doping level using the energy shift of pre-edge peak, yielding 0.074 hole per Ni site or equivalently 1.1*10^21 cm^-3 at 20 GPa for the metallic BL-La327, which is comparable to cuprates. Our results have timely examined the electronic band structures as obtained from theoretical calculations, emphasizing the essential role of both d_3z^2-r^2 and d_x^2-y^2 bands as well as the electronic correlation in superconducting pairing for pressurized La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of pairing fluctuations in a semiclassical approach: The case of study of the Josephson effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent refinements on a semiclassical approach are reviewed, aiming at describing the inhomogeneous local gap parameter in the presence of non-trivial spatial geometries and at taking into account at the same time pairing fluctuations beyond mean field. The method is applied to describe the Josephson effect over the wide range of physical conditions related to recent experiments on this topic performed with ultra-cold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Manipulation of Superconducting Properties via Ultrasonic Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Utilizing DC magnetization and AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in both $T_S$ and $H_{C2}$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum(L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even under extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitude, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects. Similar measurements on cuprate superconductors showed analogous behavior, suggesting a possible link between the observed modification of superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation.</description>

      <title>Nodeless multigap superconductivity in organic-ion-intercalated (tetrabutyl~ammonium)$_{0.3}$FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the superconducting order parameter of the organic-ion-intercalated FeSe-based superconductor (tetrabutyl ammonium)$_{0.3}$FeSe [(TBA)$_{0.3}$FeSe] using muon-spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR). Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements show only a weak temperature dependence with no evidence for magnetic ordering or broken time-reversal symmetry in the superconducting state. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density is deduced from transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements with fields applied both parallel and perpendicular to the $c$~axis axis, and can be well described by a nodeless two-gap $s+s$ wave model. These properties are reminiscent of those of (Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)OHFe$_{1-y}$Se, which also has a comparably enhanced $T_c$, suggesting that such a gap structure is a common feature of quasi-two-dimensional intercalated FeSe-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Field-angle evolution of the superconducting and magnetic phases of UTe$_2$ around the $b$ axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally determine the bounds of the magnetic-field-induced superconducting and magnetic phases near the crystalline $b$ axis of uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$). By measuring the magnetoresistance as a function of rotation angle and field strength in magnetic fields as large as 41.5 T, we have studied these boundaries in three dimensions of magnetic field direction. The phase boundaries in all cases obey crystallographic symmetries and no additional symmetries, evidence against any symmetry-breaking quadrupolar or higher magnetic order. We find that the upper critical field of the zero-field superconducting state is well-described by an anisotropic mass model. In contrast, the angular boundaries of the $b$-axis-oriented field-reentrant superconducting phase are nearly constant as a function of field up to the metamagnetic transition, with anisotropy between the $ab$ and $bc$ planes that is comparable to the angular anisotropy of the metamagnetic transition itself. We discuss the relationship between the observed superconducting boundaries and the underlying $\mathbf{d}$ vector that represents the spin-triplet order parameter. Additionally, we report an unexplained normal-state feature in resistance and track its evolution as a function of field strength and angle.</description>

      <title>Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Theory of Disordered 2D Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the roles of disorder and superconducting phase fluctuation in superconductivity has been a long-standing challenge. For example, while the phase fluctuation is expected to destroy the superconductivity of intrinsically disordered two-dimensional (2D) superconductors at any finite temperatures, there have been ample experimental evidences showing robust long-range superconducting order in ultra-thin films and atomic sheets. The observed unique superconducting-insulating transition in 2D samples with sufficiently large amount of disorder also goes beyond the conventional theoretical paradigm. Here we develop a self-consistent thermodynamic theory of the superconducting gap and phase fluctuation in disordered 2D superconductors, starting from a purely microscopic model. It incorporates both quantum and thermal phase fluctuations in the presence of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Our numerical simulation based on the developed theory successfully proves a long-range superconducting order in 2D limit even when temperature is increased away from zero, while the gradually emerging large thermal phase fluctuations with further increasing temperature destroy the superconducting gap. On the other hand, the inhomogeneous quantum phase fluctuations with increasing disorder result in a mixed state of superconducting and normal-state islands, thereby reducing $T_c$. But a robust superconductivity can survive at low temperature even at high disorder, giving rise to the prerequisite of the superconducting-insulating transition. More importantly, our theory shows that the phase fluctuation can be suppressed by increasing carrier density, leading to a carrier density-dependent $T_c$. These findings explain many of the recently observed experimental features of the superconductors in 2D limit and can potentially shed light on the understanding of high-$T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Postmortem analysis and possible rebirth of LK-99</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LK-99 hype came and went but the great potential of the apatite class of materials as platform for flat bands research must not be swept away in the process. A heuristic reinterpretation of the atomic structure of LK-99 is offered, including electronic signatures from the fully oxidized to the fully reduced. Here, copper is proposed to reside in the apatite channel rather than doping the Lead sublattice. Contact is made with the experimental x-ray powder diffractogram. The electronic signatures are found to reflect those of local [O-Cu-O] and [O-Cu-Vo**] molecular ions, where Vo** is a 2+ charged vacant oxygen site in the apatite channel. The local nature warrants flat bands. Charge carrier concentration is controlled by the oxygen content. Fully reduced LK-99 is a wide band gap insulator with a well-developed intermediate band. Fully oxidized LK-99 is a magnetic insulator, while the partially reduced LK-99 allows for hopping of holes between anti bonding pi orbitals of non-magnetic and magnetic [O-Cu-O] moieties. The findings are extended to include the case where half of the Cu atoms are replaced by Ni and half by Zn. For [O-Ni-O] +[O-Zn-Vo**] inter-site accidental near degeneracy among states at EF is reported, while for [O-Zn-O] + [O-Ni-Vo**] the near-degeneracy at EF on hole doping is among intra-site valence states exclusively on [O-Ni-Vo**]. The apatite platform is ideal for the study of flat bands associated phenomena. The reinterpreted fully reduced LK-99 system invites intrinsic intermediate band solar cells applications. Sites with variable oxygen occupation allow for holes doping, the consequences of which include strong correlations between electrons and lattice that suggest the emergence of (rebuilt) phonons mediated intra- as well as inter- bands (virtual) electron transfer-based phenomena, feeding the quest for ambient conditions superconductivity.</description>

      <title>3D printed mesoporous superconductors with periodic order on three length scales and enhanced properties via block copolymer directed self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solution-based soft matter self-assembly (SA) promises unique materials properties from approaches including additive manufacturing/three-dimensional (3D) printing. We report direct ink writing derived, hierarchically porous transition metal nitride superconductors (SCs) and precursor oxides, structure-directed by Pluronics-family block copolymer (BCP) SA and heat treated in various environments. SCs with periodic lattices on three length scales show record nanoconfinement-induced upper critical field enhancements correlated with BCP molar mass, attaining values of 50 T for NbN and 8.1 T for non-optimized TiN samples, the first mapping of a tailorable SC property onto a macromolecular parameter. They reach surface areas above 120 m$^2$/g, the highest reported for compound SCs to date. Embedded printing enables the first BCP directed mesoporous non-self-supporting helical SCs. Results suggest that additive manufacturing may open pathways to mesoporous SCs with not only a variety of macroscopic form factors but enhanced properties from intrinsic, SA-derived mesostructures with substantial academic and technological promise.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states boost odd-frequency superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict that the occurence of zero energy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov(YSR) bound states in two different setups, metal-spin flipper-metal-s-wave superconductor ($N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) and superconductor-metal-spin flipper-metal-superconductor ($S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$) junctions, can generate multi-fold enhancement of surface-induced odd-frequency superconductivity. On the other hand, in the absence of these bound states, even-frequency superconductivity dominates. Specifically, in a $S-N_{1}-sf-N_{2}-S$ Josephson junction, the emergence of zero energy YSR bound states leads to a $0-\pi$ junction transition and surface odd-frequency superconductivity dominance. Notably, odd-frequency superconductivity vanishes in the absence of YSR-bound states. Interestingly, the equal spin-triplet pairing is the dominant component in the surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity in both setups, which could have important implications for superconducting spintronics. Overall, our findings may help to detect the presence of YSR-bound states through the observation of surface induced odd-frequency superconductivity and contribute to a better understanding of their relationship.</description>

      <title>Gate control of superconducting current: Mechanisms, parameters and technological potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13734v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, the logic state of a device is set by a gate voltage (VG). The superconducting equivalent of such effect had remained unknown until it was recently shown that a VG can tune the superconducting current (supercurrent) flowing through a nanoconstriction in a superconductor. This gate-controlled supercurrent (GCS) effect can lead to superconducting logics like CMOS logics, but with lower energy dissipation. The physical mechanism underlying the GCS effect, however, remains under debate. In this review article, we illustrate the main mechanisms proposed for the GCS effect, and the material and device parameters that mostly affect it based on the evidence reported. We will come to the conclusion that different mechanisms are at play in the different studies reported so far. We then outline studies that can help answer open questions on the effect and achieve control over it, which is key for applications. We finally give insights into the impact that the GCS effect can have towards high-performance computing with low-energy dissipation and quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of physics, a pivotal moment occurred six decades ago when Brian Josephson made a groundbreaking prediction, setting in motion a series of events that would eventually earn him the prestigious Nobel Prize eleven years later. This prediction centered around what is now known as the Josephson effect, a phenomenon with far-reaching implications. At the heart of this effect lies the Josephson junction (JJ), a device that has become a linchpin in various scientific applications. This chapter delves into the foundational principles of the Josephson effect and the remarkable properties of JJs. From their role in metrology to their application in radiation detectors, these junctions have ushered in a new era of electronics. Exploiting the unique features of superconductive devices, such as high speed, low dissipation, and dispersion, JJs find today practical implementation in the development of superconductive qubits and nanotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>Representation-protected topology of spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spin-singlet $s$-wave multi-band superconductors have a topological phase protected by rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry without spin-orbit coupling in two and three dimensions. This topological phase, an example of a representation-protected topological phase, has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index and is stable as long as the bands at the Fermi energy are formed by a doublet of orbital states with finite angular momenta. In the limit of weak superconducting pair potential, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index gives a Fermi-surface formula and is related to the winding number of three-dimensional strong topological superconductors of class CI. We present a model of a topological $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductor that has gapless surface states with a quadratic dispersion and suggest a connection with iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to conduct electric current without dissipating energy is a property of superconductors that is used in magnetic systems utilized in healthcare, natural sciences, and ongoing global projects in nuclear fusion and aviation. The highest dissipation-less current is named the critical current, and this is one of the prime practical properties of superconductors (together with the critical current density, Jc). Recently, Goyal et al reported a record high Jc~190 MA/cm2 at 4.2 K in (RE)BCO films, exceeding the highest Jc in the best commercial (RE)BCO wires by a factor of five. Based on the huge potential practical impact of this high Jc, we examined the raw experimental data and found that this high value originates from an error in the conversion of units. The real Jc is 10 times smaller than the reported Jc, consistent with values currently achieved by many manufacturers.</description>

      <title>Cooper quartets in interacting hybrid superconducting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooper quartets represent exotic fermion aggregates describing correlated matter at the basis of charge-$4e$ superconductivity and offer a platform for studying four-body interactions, of interest for topologically protected quantum computing, nuclear matter simulations, and more general strongly correlated matter. Focusing on solid-state systems, we show how to quantum design Cooper quartets in a double-dot system coupled to ordinary superconducting leads through the introduction of an attractive interdot interaction. A fundamentally novel, maximally correlated double-dot ground state, in the form of a superposition of vacuum $|0\rangle$ and four-electron state $|4e\rangle$, emerges as a narrow resonance in a many-body quartet correlator that is accompanied by negligible pair correlations and features a rich phenomenology. The system represents an instance of correlated Andreev matter and the results open the way to the exploration of interaction effects in hybrid superconducting devices, and the study of novel correlated states of matter with ingredients available in a quantum solid-state laboratory.</description>

      <title>Transverse Cooper-Pair Rectifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices are key components in modern electronics covering broad applications ranging from transistors to logic circuits thanks to the output rectified signal in the direction parallel to the input. In this work, we propose a transverse Cooper-pair rectifier in which a non-reciprocal current is perpendicular to the driving field, when inversion, time reversal, and mirror symmetries are broken simultaneously. The Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism is developed to describe the transverse current-voltage relation in a normal-metal/superconductor tunneling junction, where symmetry constraints are achieved by an effective built-in supercurrent manifesting in an asymmetric and anisotropic Andreev reflection. The asymmetry in the Andreev reflection is induced when inversion and time reversal symmetry are broken by the supercurrent component parallel to the junction while the anisotropy occurs when the mirror symmetry with respect to the normal of the junction interface is broken by the perpendicular supercurrent component to the junction. Compared to the conventional longitudinal one, the transverse rectifier supports fully polarized diode efficiency and colossal nonreciprocal conductance rectification, completely decoupling the path of the input excitation from the output rectified signal. This work provides a formalism for realizing transverse non-reciprocity in superconducting junctions, which is expected to be achieved by modifying current experimental setups and may pave the way for future low-dissipation superconducting electronics.</description>
