      <title>On The Topology of Polygonal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is an introductory and informal exposition on the topology of polygonal meshes. We begin with a broad overview of topological notions and discuss how homeomorphisms, homotopy, and homology can be used to characterize topology. We move on to define polygonal meshes and make a distinction between intrinsic topology and extrinsic topology which depends on the embedding space. A distinction is also made between quantitative topological properties and qualitative properties. We outline a proof of the Euler and the Euler-Poincar\'e formulas. The Betti numbers are defined in terms of the Euler-Poincar\'e formula and other mesh statistics rather than as cardinalities of the homology groups which allows us to avoid abstract algebra. Finally, we discuss how it is possible to cut a polygonal mesh such that it becomes a topological disc.</description>

      <title>The Engineering and Programming Methods Used in Manufacture of Astrolabes and Errors Resulting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we first reviewed the traditional astrolabe design methods and identified potential sources of manufacturing error. We then proposed an analytical approach using computer assistance to develop designs for the astrolabe components. This approach marks a pioneering step toward designing and producing a physical astrolabe model aided by computer technology. Our goal was to revive this significant heritage instrument while leveraging modern techniques and software to produce astrolabe models free from traditional manufacturing inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>From Euler to AI: Unifying Formulas for Mathematical Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The constant $\pi$ has fascinated scholars throughout the centuries, inspiring numerous formulas for its evaluation, such as infinite sums and continued fractions. Despite their individual significance, many of the underlying connections among formulas remain unknown, missing unifying theories that could unveil deeper understanding. The absence of a unifying theory reflects a broader challenge across math and science: knowledge is typically accumulated through isolated discoveries, while deeper connections often remain hidden. In this work, we present an automated framework for the unification of mathematical formulas. Our system combines Large Language Models (LLMs) for systematic formula harvesting, an LLM-code feedback loop for validation, and a novel symbolic algorithm for clustering and eventual unification. We demonstrate this methodology on the hallmark case of $\pi$, an ideal testing ground for symbolic unification. Applying this approach to 455,050 arXiv papers, we validate 385 distinct formulas for $\pi$ and prove relations between 360 (94%) of them, of which 166 (43%) can be derived from a single mathematical object - linking canonical formulas by Euler, Gauss, Brouncker, and newer ones from algorithmic discoveries by the Ramanujan Machine.
  Our method generalizes to other constants, including $e$, $\zeta(3)$, and Catalan's constant, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted mathematics to uncover hidden structures and unify knowledge across domains.</description>

      <title>An Ontology-Based Approach to Optimizing Geometry Problem Sets for Skill Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean geometry has historically played a central role in cultivating logical reasoning and abstract thinking within mathematics education, but has experienced waning emphasis in recent curricula. The resurgence of interest, driven by advances in artificial intelligence and educational technology, has highlighted geometry's potential to develop essential cognitive skills and inspired new approaches to automated problem solving and proof verification. This article presents an ontology-based framework for annotating and optimizing geometry problem sets, originally developed in the 1990s. The ontology systematically classifies geometric problems, solutions, and associated skills into interlinked facts, objects, and methods, supporting granular tracking of student abilities and facilitating curriculum design. The core concept of 'solution graphs'--directed acyclic graphs encoding multiple solution pathways and skill dependencies--enables alignment of problem selection with instructional objectives. We hypothesize that this framework also points toward automated solution validation via semantic parsing. We contend that our approach addresses longstanding challenges in representing dynamic, procedurally complex mathematical knowledge, paving the way for adaptive, feedback-rich educational tools. Our methodology offers a scalable, adaptable foundation for future advances in intelligent geometry education and automated reasoning.</description>
