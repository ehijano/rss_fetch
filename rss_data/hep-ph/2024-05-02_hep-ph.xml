      <title>Cosmic Ray-Boosted Dark Matter at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) upscattering of dark matter is considered as one of the most straightforward mechanisms to accelerate ambient dark matter, making it detectable at high threshold, large volume experiments. In this work, we revisit CR upscattered dark matter signals at the IceCube detector, focusing on lower energy data than was considered before. We consider both scattering with electrons and nuclei. In the latter, we include both elastic and deep-inelastic scattering computations. As concrete examples, we consider two benchmark models; Fermion dark matter with vector and scalar mediators. We compare our model projections with the most current constraints and show that the IceCube detector can detect CR-boosted dark matter especially with masses below $\sim$ 100 keV when scattering with electrons and $\sim$ MeV in the nucleon scattering case.</description>

      <title>Mass from Nothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Abelian Higgs model with multiple scalar fields, but without mass terms. Solving the model non-perturbatively order-by-order in the number of scalar fields, we find that radiative corrections generate masses for the scalar and gauge boson, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mass scales are set by the $\Lambda$-parameter of the electroweak running coupling, thereby naturally avoiding the hierarchy problem. No part of our calculation employs a weak-coupling expansion, and we find that the perturbative vacuum is metastable, and hence must decay to the stable non-perturbative vacuum of the theory, which we identify. Although the field content of our Lagrangian is standard, our results predict the existence of two heavy scalar resonances in addition to the Higgs. We believe that these predicted resonances will ultimately allow experimentalists to discriminate between our method and standard solutions of the Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Can the QCD axion feed a dark energy component?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB) coupled to a confining gauge group via an anomalous term is characterised, during the confining phase transition, by a temperature dependent mass $m^2(T) \propto T^{-n}$. For $n&gt;2$, a non-relativistic population of such particles dominating the cosmological energy density would act as dark energy (DE), accelerating the expansion. We study the possibility that a PNGB $\varphi_b$ coupled to a hidden gauge group that is presently undergoing confinement could realise this scenario. To obtain the observed amount of DE, the number density of $\varphi_b$ must be boosted by some mechanism. Assuming that the QCD axion $\varphi_a$ constitutes the dark matter (DM), a non-adiabatic level crossing between $\varphi_a$ and $\varphi_b$ shortly before matter-DE equality can convert a small fraction of DM into DE, providing such mechanism and explaining the coincidence puzzle.</description>

      <title>How to rule out $(g-2)_\mu$ in $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ with White Dwarf Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the gauge group $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ has received a lot of attention since it can, in principle, account for the observed excess in the anomalous muon magnetic moment $(g-2)_\mu$, as well as the Hubble tension. Due to unavoidable, loop-induced kinetic mixing with the SM photon and $Z$, the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson $A'$ can contribute to stellar cooling via decays into neutrinos. In this work, we perform for the first time an \textit{ab initio} computation of the neutrino emissivities of white dwarf stars due to plasmon decay in a model of gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$. Our central finding is that an observation of the early-stage white dwarf neutrino luminosity at the 30% level could exclude (or partially exclude) the remaining allowed parameter space for explaining $(g-2)_\mu$. In this work, we present the relevant white dwarf sensitivities over the entire $A'$ mass range. In particular, we have performed a rigorous computation of the luminosities in the resonant regime, where the $A'$ mass is comparable to the white dwarf plasma frequencies.</description>

      <title>Flavor Phenomenology of Light Dark Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light dark matter with flavor-violating couplings to fermions may be copiously produced in the laboratory as missing energy from decays of SM particles. Here we study the effective Lagrangian of a light dark vector with generic dipole or vector couplings. We calculate the resulting two-body decay rates of mesons, baryons and leptons as a function of the dark vector mass and show that existing experimental limits probe UV scales as large as $10^{12} \,\mathrm{GeV}$. We also derive the general RGEs in order to constrain the flavor-universal UV scenario, where all flavor violation arises radiatively proportional to the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>Transmon Qubit Constraints on Dark Matter-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently pointed out that power measurements of single quasiparticle devices can be used to detect dark matter. These devices have the lowest known energy thresholds, far surpassing standard direct detection experiments, requiring energy deposition above only about an meV. We calculate dark matter induced quasiparticle densities in transmon qubits, and use the latest transmon qubit measurements that provide one of the strongest existing lab-based bounds on dark matter-nucleon scattering below about 100 MeV. We strongly constrain sub-component dark matter, using both a dark matter population thermalized in the Earth as well as the dark matter wind from the Galactic halo. We demonstrate future potential sensitivities using devices with low quasiparticle densities.</description>

      <title>Sterile neutrino dark matter within the $\nu$SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos with masses at the $\mathrm{keV}$ scale and mixing to the active neutrinos offer an elegant explanation of the observed dark matter (DM) density. However, the very same mixing inevitably leads to radiative photon emission and the non-observation of such peaked $X$-ray lines rules out this minimal sterile neutrino DM hypothesis. We show that in the context of the Standard Model effective field theory with sterile neutrinos ($\nu$SMEFT), higher dimensional operators can produce sterile neutrino DM in a broad range of parameter space. In particular, $\nu$SMEFT interactions can open the large mixing parameter space due to their destructive interference, through operator mixing or matching, in the $X$-ray emission. We also find that, even in the zero mixing limit, the DM density can always be explained by $\nu$SMEFT operators. The testability of the studied $\nu$SMEFT operators in searches for electric dipole moments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and pion decay measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole probes of heavy neutral leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH), while still constituting a viable dark matter component, are expected to evaporate through Hawking radiation. Assuming the semi-classical approximation holds up to near the Planck scale, PBHs are expected to evaporate by the present time, emitting a significant flux of particles in their final moments, if produced in the early Universe with an initial mass of $\sim 10^{15}$ g. These ''exploding'' black holes will release a burst of Standard Model particles alongside any additional degrees of freedom, should they exist. We explore the possibility that heavy neutral leptons (HNL), mixing with active neutrinos, are emitted in the final evaporation stages. We calculate the expected number of active neutrinos from such an event, including contributions due to the HNL decay for different assumptions on the mixings. We infer sensitivities on the active-sterile neutrino mixing and on the sterile neutrino mass, finding that, for instance, for the scenario where $U_{\tau 4}\neq 0$, IceCube could improve current constraints by $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude, for HNLs masses between 0.1 - 1 GeV, for a PBH at a distance of $\sim 10^{-4}$ pc from Earth.</description>

      <title>An analytical formula for signal optimization in stimulated photon-photon scattering setup with three laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a setup to detect stimulated photon-photon scattering using high-power lasers. Signal photons are emitted from an overlap of the incoming intense laser pulses focused in vacuum from three sides. We derive and justify a general approximate analytical formula for the angular distribution and total yield of such signal photons in terms of the parameters of the incoming pulses, including their intensity, carrier frequencies, durations, focusing, polarizations, mutual orientation and overlap. Using the obtained formula a parametric study of the signal is carried out and optimization is performed.</description>

      <title>Supernova limits on 'QCD axion-like particles'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the phenomenology of massive Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to quarks and gluons, dubbed 'QCD ALPs', with an emphasis on the associated low-energy observables. ALPs coupled to gluons and quarks not only induce nuclear interactions at scales below the QCD-scale, relevant for ALP production in supernovae (SNe), but naturally also couple to photons similarly to the QCD-axion. We discuss the link between the high-energy formulation of ALP theories and their effective couplings with nucleons and photons. The induced photon coupling allows ALPs with masses $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV to efficiently decay into photons, and astrophysical observables severely constrain the ALP parameter space. We show that a combination of arguments related to SN events rule out ALP-nucleon couplings down to $g_{aN}\gtrsim 10^{-11}- 10^{-10}$ for $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV - a region of the parameter space that was hitherto unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the effective loop interaction of the Chern-Simons bosons with leptons. The unitary gauge case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the extension of the Standard Model with Chern-Simons type interaction. There is a new vector massive boson (Chern-Simons bosons) in this extension. Using only three-particle dimension-4 interaction of the Chern-Simons bosons with vector bosons of the SM, we consider effective loop interaction of a new vector boson with leptons. We consider the renormalizability of this loop interaction and conclude that for the case of computation of loop diagrams in the unitary gauge, we can not get rid of the divergences in the effective interaction of the Chern-Simons bosons with leptons.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Charm and Doubly-Bottom Pentaquark molecular States via the QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the doubly-charm and doubly-bottom pentaquark molecular states $D^{(*)}\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ and $B^{(*)}\Sigma_b^{(*)}$ are studied via the QCD sum rules. Sixteen color singlet-singlet type currents with the definite isospin-spin-parity $IJ^P$ are constructed to interpolate the corresponding hadronic states with the same quantum numbers. The masses and pole residues of those doubly-heavy pentaquark molecular states are calculated, the results show that their masses are all below the corresponding meson-baryon thresholds, which means that they are possible bound states, not resonant states, moreover, the possible decay channels for the doubly-charm molecular states are given.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of Hybrid Charmonium, Bottomonium and $B_c$ Mesons by Power Series Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power series method (PSM) is revisited to find the masses of S, P, and D states of conventional charmonium ($c\overline{c}$), bottomonium ($b\overline{b}$), and $B_c$ ($\overline{b}c$) mesons by assuming the solution of N-dimensional radial Schrodinger equation in series form. An extension in the potential model is proposed by fitting it with lattice data to study the hybrid mesons. The proposed potential model is used to find the masses of hybrid $c\overline{c}$, $b\overline{b}$, and $\overline{b}c$ mesons by applying the power series method. Calculated results are compared with theoretical findings and available experimental data. Our results can be helpful for the investigation of newly experimentally discovered charmonium, bottomonium, and $B_c$ states.</description>

Abstract: Using the standard parametrization of the dipole form, we have studied the vulnerability of $Q^2$ on the vector form factors ($f_i^{B_iB_f}(Q^2)$) and axial-vector form factors ($g_i^{B_iB_f}(Q^2)$), $i=1,2,3$ computed for the semileptonic $B_i \rightarrow B_f l \bar{\nu}$ decays for hyperons in the framework of chiral constituent quark model ($\chi$CQM). Both, strangeness changing as well as strangeness conserving decays have been examined. We also present the dependence of the ratio of hyperon semileptonic decay constants $g_1(Q^2)/f_1(Q^2)$ for these decays. Further, we calculate the CKM matrix elements $V_{ud}$ from strangeness conserving and $V_{us}$ from strangeness changing hyperon decays.</description>

Abstract: Being the fountainhead of transverse distortion and asymmetries in accordance to $``SSA=GPD \ast FSI\,"$, we study the spin flip generalized parton distribution. We demonstrate this transverse deformation by using the quark-scalar diquark model and unveil a comparison among the low-lying strange baryons for distinct feasible combinations of quark-diquark pairs. Final-state interaction originating the correlation of a target spin and a virtual photon to the generated pion plane in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering has also been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Quark spin-orbit correlations in spin-0 and spin-1 mesons using the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the spin-orbital angular momentum correlations for the active quark inside the light and heavy mesons for both the spin-0 and spin-1 cases. These correlations can be derived from the generalised transverse momentum dependent distributions (GTMDs) as well as the generalised parton distributions (GPDs). We employ the overlap representation of light-front wave functions in the light-front quark model (LFQM) to calculate our analytical results. The dependence of spin-orbit correlations (SOCs) on the longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ as well as the transverse momentum dependence $\mathbf{k}_{\perp}$ has been graphically presented. Even though the SOCs have already been studied for the spin-0 pions and kaons in other approaches, no calculations for the other light and heavy spin-0 mesons have been reported in literature. Further, the correlations for any of the light and heavy spin-1 mesons have been studied for the first time in the present work.</description>

      <title>A first-order deconfinement phase transition in the early universe and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the conditions of the cosmic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) first-order phase transition in the early universe by carefully distinguishing the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions. While the chiral one with light quarks at zero chemical potential is unlikely to be first order based on the recent lattice QCD calculations, the latter one can be naturally extended with one extra rolling scalar to be first order. The argument is also valid for the dark QCD theory with arbitrary $N_c$ with a wide range of phase transition temperatures, which can be from hundreds of MeV up to beyond TeV. Notably, here we derive the general formula for the deconfinement phase transition potential of SU($N_c$) gauge theory characterized by the Polyakov loop. With the effective potential in hand, the gravitational wave spectrum is then determined via the sound shell model, which then enables us to give for the first time the quantitative analysis of the gravitational wave signals coming from the QCD deconfinement phase transition and awaits the check from future space interferometers.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the form factors of the transitions $B_{(s)} \to D_{0}^{\ast}(2300),D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317),$ $ D_{s1}(2460) $ and $ D_{s1}(2536)$ in the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM), where these final states are considered as P-wave excited charmed mesons. In order to obtain the form factors for the physical transition processes, we need to extend these form factors from the space-like region to the time-like region. The $q^{2}$-dependence for each transition form factor is also plotted. Then, combined with those form factors, the branching ratios of the two-body nonleptonic decays $B_{(s)}\to D^*_{(s)0}(2300,2317)M, D_{s1}(2460,2536)M$ with $M$ being a light pseudoscalar (vector) meson or a charmed meson are calculated by considering the QCD radiative corrections to the hadronic matrix elements with the QCD factorization approach. Most of our predictions are comparable to the results given by other theoretical approaches and the present available data.</description>

      <title>Isospin violation effect and three-body decays of the $T_{cc}^{+}$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we make a study of $T_{cc}^+$ state observed by the LHCb collaboration in 2021. In obtaining the effective potentials using the One-Boson-Exchange Potential Model we use an exponential form factor, and find that in the short and medium range, the contributions of the $\pi$, $\rho$ and $\omega$ exchanges are comparable while in the long range the pion-exchange contribution is dominant. Based on the assumption that $T_{cc}^+$ is a loosely bound state of $D^*D$, we focus on its three-body decay using the meson-exchange method. Considering that the difference between the thresholds of $D^{*+}D^0$ and $D^{*0}D^+$ is even larger than the binding energy of $T_{cc}^+$, the isospin-breaking effect is amplified by the small binding energy of $T_{cc}^+$. Explicitly including such an isospin-breaking effect we obtain, by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, that the probability of the isoscalar component is about $91\%$ while that of the isovector component is around $9\%$ for $T_{cc}^+$. Using the experimental value of the mass of $T_{cc}^+$ as an input, we obtain the wave function of $T_{cc}^+$ and further obtain its width via the three-body hadronic as well as the radiative decays. The total width we obtain is in agreement with the experimental value of the LHCb measurement with a unitarised Breit-Wigner profile. Conversely, the current results support the conclusion that $T_{cc}^+$ is a hadronic molecule of $D^*D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the two-loop mixed strong-electroweak virtual corrections to the charged current Drell-Yan process. The final-state collinear singularities are regularised by the lepton mass. The evaluation of all the relevant Feynman integrals, including those with up to two different internal massive lines, has been worked out relying on semi-analytical techniques, using complex-valued masses. We can provide, at any arbitrary phase-space point, the solution as a power series in the $W$-boson mass, around a reference value. Starting from these expansions, we can prepare a numerical grid for any value of the $W$-boson mass within their radius of convergence in a negligible amount of time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge/gravity dualities provide a very useful approach into solving strongly coupled systems. We apply this to Composite Higgs models and determine the mass hierarchies of the corresponding bound states. As a cross check we apply this to QCD and compare the results to existing lattice calculations for which we find good agreement. We then focus on a particular example whose phenomenology has recently been studied in the literature in a generic way and outline first phenomenological implications of our findings for the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Tomography of flavoured leptogenesis with primordial blue gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a scenario where an early epoch of matter domination is driven by the mass scale $M_N$ of the right-handed neutrinos, which also characterizes the different flavour regimes of leptogenesis. Such a matter-domination epoch gives rise to peculiar spectral imprints on primordial Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during inflation. We point out that the characteristic spectral features are detectable in multiple frequency bands with current and future GW experiments in case of Blue GWs (BGWs) described by a power-law with a positive spectral index $(n_T &gt;0)$ and an amplitude compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. We find that the three-flavour leptogenesis regime with $M_N \lesssim 10^9~{\rm GeV}$ imprints BGWs more prominently than the two-flavour and one-flavour regimes characterized by a higher right-neutrino mass scale. In particular, a two-flavour (three-flavour) leptogenesis regime is expected to leave distinct imprints in the mHz ($\mu$Hz) band. Moreover, we translate the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and LIGO limits on the GW energy density into constraints on the flavour leptogenesis parameter space for different GW spectral index $n_T$. Interestingly, a three-flavour leptogenesis regime can offer a unique signal testable in the next LIGO run with a correlated signature in the PTA frequency band with an amplitude comparable to the one expected from supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a moderately large cross section from the Earth's core at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is assumed that heavy dark matter $\phi$ with O(TeV) mass captured by the Earth may decay to relativistic light milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $2\times10^{-5}\lesssim\epsilon^2\lesssim4.5\times10^{-3}$. And a new region of 100 MeV &lt; $m_{MCP}$ &lt; 10 GeV and $4.47\times10^{-3}$ $\lesssim$ $\epsilon$ $\lesssim$ $9.41\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 10 years of IceCube data.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxy clusters: giant dark matter particle colliders, powered by gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial particle accelerators collide charged particles, then watch the trajectory of outgoing debris - but they cannot manipulate dark matter. Fortunately, dark matter is the main component of galaxy clusters, which are continuously pulled together by gravity. We show that galaxy cluster mergers can be exploited as enormous, natural dark matter colliders. We analyse hydrodynamical simulations of a universe containing self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which all particles interact via gravity, and dark matter particles can also scatter off each other via a massive mediator. During cluster collisions, SIDM spreads out and lags behind cluster member galaxies. Individual systems can have quirky dynamics that makes them difficult to interpret. Statistically, however, we find that the mean or median of dark matter's spatial offset in many collisions can be robustly modelled, and is independent of our viewing angle and halo mass even in collisions between unequal-mass systems. If the SIDM cross-section were sigma/m = 0.1cm^2/g = 0.18 barn/GeV, the 'bulleticity' lag would be ~5 percent that of gas due to ram pressure, and could be detected at 95 percent confidence in weak lensing observations of ~100 well-chosen clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dirac equation has resided among the greatest successes of modern physics since its emergence as the first quantum mechanical theory fully compatible with special relativity. This compatibility ensures that the expectation value of the velocity is less than the vacuum speed of light. Here, we show that the Dirac equation admits free-particle solutions where the peak amplitude of the wavefunction can travel at any velocity, including those exceeding the vacuum speed of light, despite having a subluminal velocity expectation value. The solutions are constructed by superposing basis functions with correlations in momentum space. These arbitrary velocity wavefunctions feature a near-constant profile and may impact quantum mechanical processes that are sensitive to the local value of the probability density as opposed to expectation values.</description>

Abstract: We propose a particle production mechanism analogous to the particle photoproduction processes, arising from the gluon-nucleon interactions in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The comparison is made on the effect of the gluon-nucleon interactions on the photon production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV. The numerical results indicate that as the collision energy increases, the contribution of gluon-nucleon interactions becomes more prominent.</description>

      <title>Four loop renormalization in six dimensions using Forcer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Forcer algorithm to renormalize a variety of six dimensional field theories to four loops. In order to achieve this we construct the Forcer master integrals in six dimensions from their four dimensional counterparts by using the Tarasov method. The $\epsilon$ expansion of the six dimensional masters are determined up to weight $9$ where $d$ $=$ $6$ $-$ $2\epsilon$. By applying the Forcer routine the four loop MSbar renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory is reproduced before gauge theories are considered. The renormalization of these theories is also determined in the MOMt scheme. For instance the absence of $\zeta_4$ and $\zeta_6$ is confirmed to five loops in the MOMt renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory. We also evaluate the three loop $\beta$-function of the gauge coupling in six dimensional QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fate of ultralight black holes depends on whether or not evaporation stops at or around the Planck scale. If evaporation stops, the general expectation is that a population of Planck-scale will be left over, possibly including a significant fraction of electrically charged relics. If evaporation does not stop, a runaway "explosion" would occur, with significant and potentially detectable high-energy emission. Here, I review both possibilities, with an emphasis on current status and future detection prospects.</description>

Abstract: We construct a gauge $B-L$ model with $D_4\times Z_4\times Z_2$ symmetry that can explain the quark and lepton mass hierarchies and their mixings with the realistic CP phases via the type-I seesaw mechanism. Six quark mases, three quark mixing angles and CP phase in the quark sector can get the central values and Yukawa couplings in the quark sector are diluted a range of three orders of magnitude difference by the perturbation theory at the first order. For neutrino sector, the smallness of neutrino mass is achieved by the Type-I seesaw mechanism. Both inverted and normal neutrino mass hierarchies are in consistent with the experimental data. The prediction for the sum of neutrino masses for normal and inverted hierarchies, the effective neutrino masses and the Dirac CP phase are well consistent with all the recent limits.</description>

Abstract: Observation of lepton number violation would represent a groundbreaking discovery with profound consequences for fundamental physics and as such, it has motivated an extensive experimental program searching for neutrinoless double beta decay. However, the violation of lepton number can be also tested by a variety of other observables. We focus on the possibilities of probing this fundamental symmetry within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) beyond the minimal dimension-5. Specifically, we study the bounds on $\Delta L = 2$ dimension-7 effective operators beyond the electron flavor imposed by all relevant low-energy observables and confront them with derived high-energy collider limits. We also discuss how the synergy of the analyzed multi-frontier observables can play a crucial role in distinguishing among different dimension-7 SMEFT operators.</description>

      <title>Foliation, topology and nucleon charge profiles in hypersphere soliton model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the hypersphere soliton model (HSM), we study the geometrical inner structures and the ensuing charge distributions of the nucleons by exploiting the aspect of the HSM where the hypersphere soliton is described by an extended object possessing the parameter $\lambda$ $(0\le\lambda&lt;\infty)$ which corresponds to the radial distance from the center of $S^{3}$ to the foliation leaves of the hypersphere soliton. To do this, we investigate the foliation and topology related with geometry on a hypersphere described by $(\mu,\theta,\phi)$. Exploiting the so-called scanning algorithm we study geometrical relations between spherical shell foliation leave on a northern hemi-hypersphere $S^{3}_{+}$ and that on a flat equatorial solid sphere $E^{3}$ which contains the center of $S^{3}$. We then elucidate the physical meaning of $\mu$ in $S^{3}$ of radius $\lambda$ by showing that $\mu$ plays the role of an auxiliary angle to fix the radius $\lambda\sin\mu$ of the $S^{2}$ spherical shell sharing the center of $S^{3}(=S^{2}\times S^{1})$, at a given angle $\mu$. Next, using the charge density profiles of nucleons with $\mu$ dependence, we construct the nucleon fractional charges of spherically symmetric and nontrivial distributions. In the HSM we note that the proton and neutron charges do not leak out from the hypersphere soliton, and the positive and negative charges in the neutron are confined inside and outside its core, respectively. Explicitly we predict the fractional volumes and charges of the neutron. The proton and neutron are shown to be described by a topological structure of two Hopf-linked M\"obius strip type twist circles in $S^{3}$. We also note that the characteristic ratio of the hypersphere volume to the corresponding solid sphere one is given by a geometrical invariant related with hyper-compactness.</description>

Abstract: Young neutron stars cool via the emission of neutrinos from their core. A precise understanding of all the different processes producing neutrinos in the hot and degenerate matter is essential for assessing the cooling rate of such stars. The main Standard Model processes contributing to this effect are $\nu$ bremsstrahlung, mURCA among others. In this paper, we investigate another Standard Model process initiated by the Wess-Zumino-Witten term, leading to the emission of neutrino pairs via $N\gamma\to N\nu\bar\nu$. We find that for proto-neutron stars, such processes, with degenerate neutrons, can be comparable and even dominate over the prototypical and well-known cooling mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Peccei-Quinn Inflation at the Pole and Axion Kinetic Misalignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model with the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalar field and explain the relic density of the QCD axion through the kinetic misalignment with a relatively small axion decay constant. To this purpose, we consider a slow-roll inflation from the radial component of the PQ field with the PQ conserving potential near the pole of its kinetic term and investigate the post-inflationary dynamics of the PQ field for reheating. The angular mode of the PQ field, identified with the QCD axion, receives a nonzero velocity during inflation due to the PQ violating potential, evolving with an approximately conserved Noether PQ charge. We determine the reheating temperature from the perturbative decays and scattering processes of the inflaton and obtain dark radiation from the axions produced from the inflaton scattering at a testable level in the future Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. We show the correlation between the reheating temperature, the initial velocity of the axion and the axion decay constant, realizing the axion kinetic misalignment for the correct relic density.</description>

      <title>Instanton NDA and Applications to Axion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple set of power counting rules which allows us to easily estimate calculable instanton effects up to $O(1)$ factors. We apply the resulting Instanton NDA to examine the effects of small instantons on various axion models. We confirm that mechanisms that increase the axion mass via small instantons generically also lead to an enhancement of misaligned instanton contributions to the axion potential, deepening the axion quality problem. For generic models, new sources of CP violation in the UV must be absent in order to raise the axion mass above the QCD prediction. However, we find that $Z_N$ and composite axions are UV-safe against these misalignment effects. Axion GUT models are also insensitive to UV contributions at the GUT scale, unless a very large number of extra states are introduced below this scale.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and polytropic index in QCD matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the speed of sound and polytropic index of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter in the full phase diagram based on a 3-flavor Polyakov-looped Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (pNJL) model. The speed of sound and polytropic index in isothermal and adiabatic cases all have a dip structure at the low chemical potential side of the chiral phase transition boundary, and these quantities reach their global minimum values at the critical endpoint (CEP) but are not completely zero, where the values in adiabatic are lightly greater than those in isothermal. Different from the speed of sound, the polytropic index also exists a peak around the chiral phase transition boundary. Along the hypothetical chemical freeze-out lines, the speed of sound rapidly decreases near the CEP, followed by a small spinodal behavior, while the polytropic index, especially in isothermal, exhibits a more pronounced and nearly closed to zero dip structure as it approaches the CEP.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of inflaton-mediated dark and visible matter scatterings after reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial density of dark matter (DM) particles, otherwise secluded from the standard model (SM), may be generated at reheating, with an initial temperature ratio for internal thermalizations, $\xi_i=T_{\rm DM,i}/T_{\rm SM,i}$. This scenario necessarily implies inflaton-mediated scatterings between DM and SM after reheating, with a rate fixed by the relic abundance of DM and the reheat temperature. These scatterings can be important for an inflaton mass and reheat temperature as high as $\mathcal{O}(10^7 {~\rm GeV})$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^9{~\rm GeV})$, respectively, since the thermally averaged collision terms become approximately independent of the inflaton mass when the bath temperature is larger than the mass. The impact of these scatterings on DM cosmology is studied modeling the perturbative reheating physics by a gauge-invariant set of inflaton interactions upto dimension-5 with the SM gauge bosons, fermions and the Higgs fields. It is observed that an initially lower (higher) DM temperature will rapidly increase (decrease), even with very small couplings to the inflaton. There is a sharp lower bound on the DM mass below which the relic abundance cannot be satisfied due to faster back-scatterings depleting DM quanta to SM particles. For low DM masses, the CMB constraints become stronger due to the collisions for $\xi_i&lt;1$, probing values as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, and weaker for $\xi_i&gt;1$. The BBN constraints become stronger due to the collisions for lower DM masses, probing $\xi_i$ as small as $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, and weaker for higher DM mass. Thus inflaton-mediated collisions with predictable rates, relevant even for high-scale inflation models, can significantly impact the cosmology of light DM.</description>

Abstract: From a cosmological perspective, scalar fields are well-motivated dark matter and dark energy candidates. Several possibilities of neutrino couplings with a time-varying cosmic field have been investigated in the literature. In this work, we present a framework in which violations of Lorentz invariance (LIV) and $CPT$ symmetry in the neutrino sector could arise from an interaction among neutrinos with a time-varying scalar field. Furthermore, some cosmological and phenomenological aspects and constraints concerning this type of interaction are discussed. Potential violations of Lorentz and $CPT$ symmetries at present and future neutrino oscillation experiments such as IceCube and KM3NeT can probe this scenario.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics in light of recent developments in $b \rightarrow c \ell \nu$ transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental studies of the observables associated with the $b \rightarrow c$ transitions in the semileptonic $B-$ meson decays at BaBar, Belle and LHCb have shown some deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions, consequently, providing a handy tool to probe the possible new physics (NP). In this context, we have first revisited the impact of recent measurements of $R({D^{(*)}})$ and $R(\Lambda_c)$ on the parametric space of the NP scenarios. In addition, we have included the $R(J/\psi)$ data in the analysis and found that their influence on the best-fit points and the parametric space is mild. Using the recent HFLAV data, after validating the well established sum rule of $R(\Lambda_c)$, we derived the similar sum rule for $R(J/\psi)$. Furthermore, according to the updated data, we have modified the correlation among the different observables, giving us their interesting interdependence. Finally, to discriminate the various NP scenarios, we have plotted the different angular observables and their ratios for $B \to D^* \tau\nu_\tau$ against the transfer momentum square $\left(q^2\right)$, using the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ parametric space of considered NP scenarios. By implementing the collider bounds on NP Wilson coefficients, we find that, in the parametric space of some NP WCs is significantly restrained. To see the clear influence of NP on the amplitude of the angular observables, we have also calculated their numerical values in different $q^2$ bins and shown them through the bar plots. We hope their precise measurements will help to discriminate various NP scenarios.</description>

      <title>Impact of JLab data on the determination of GPDs at zero skewness and new insights from transition form factors $ N\rightarrow \Delta $</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established now that the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness are playing important roles in some physical process such as elastic electron-nucleon scattering, elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering, and wide-angle Compton scattering (WACS) via various types of form factors (FFs). In this study, we are going to utilize the recent JLab measurements of the elastic electron-nucleon scattering reduced cross-section, namely GMp12, as a touchstone to unravel the tension observed between the measurements of the WACS cross-section and the data of the proton magnetic FF $ G_M^p $. We also investigate the impact of GMp12 data on valence unpolarized GPDs $ H_v^q $ and $ E_v^q $ at zero skewness by performing some $ \chi^2 $ analyses of the related experimental data. By calculating the electric and scalar quadrupole ratios, $ R_{EM} $ and $ R_{SM} $, and magnetic transition FF $ G^*_M/3G_D $ related to the nucleon-to-delta ($ N\rightarrow \Delta $) transition using the extracted GPDs and comparing the results with corresponding experimental measurements, we show that our results are in an excellent consistency with experiments, indicating the universality property of GPDs. We emphasize that the inclusion of these data in the future analysis of GPDs can significantly affect the extracted GPDs especially their uncertainties at smaller values of $ Q^2 $.</description>

Abstract: Using the BPS Lagrangian method, we obtain a distinct set of Bogomolny equations for the Cho-Maison monopoles from the bosonic sector of a regularized electroweak theory. In the limit of $n\rightarrow\infty$ of the permittivity regulator, $\epsilon\left(\rho^n\right)$, the mass of the monopole can be estimated to be $M_W\sim3.56$ TeV. This value is within the latest theoretical window, 2.98 TeV - 3.75 TeV. We also discuss some possible regularization mechanisms of electroweak monopole in the Yang-Mills sector and the existence of its BPS state.</description>

Abstract: A global interpretation of several significant indications of scalar resonances observed at LHC is achieved using the Georgi Machacek model. Among many other consequences, one predicts large cross sections for the processes ggFH(320)-&gt;h(125)h(125) and A(151)A(151) and ggF-&gt;A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z, where H(320) has been observed in A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z-&gt;bbbbl+l- and where A(151) is observed into two photons accompanied by a b jet, a lepton or missing transverse energy. We predict that ggF-&gt;H(320) has a cross section of about 2000 fb with a BR into h(125)(125) of 17% and into A(151)A(151) of 45%. Henceforth we predict that ggF-&gt;H(320)-&gt;hh will dominate over the SM process h*-&gt;hh, where h is the SM h(125) scalar. One expects that H(320)-&gt;A(151)A(151) can be observed into bbbb, becoming one of the most significant BSM phenomena identified so far. Arguments in favor of a SUSY version of GM are provided.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore how constraints based on interference effects for the negative gauge-Higgs coupling scenario are affected by new physics. Models that achieve this wrong-sign gauge-Higgs coupling inevitably have new charged Higgs states. These states affect the interpretation of interference effects. We recast the ATLAS analysis for VBF $Wh$, showing that the previously excluded negative gauge-Higgs coupling scenario is still experimentally viable for charged Higgs masses below $370$ GeV. We show that it is possible to weaken this bound further with mild tuning in the parameter space. We discuss how to further constrain the wrong-sign gauge-Higgs coupling hypothesis and point out the potential of VBF $Zh$ to exclude this scenario in a model-independent way.</description>

Abstract: New research has highlighted a shortfall in the Standard Model (SM) because it predicts neutrinos to have zero mass. However, recent experiments on neutrino oscillation have revealed that the majority of neutrino parameters indeed indicate their significant mass. In response, scientists are increasingly incorporating discrete symmetries alongside continuous ones for better justification of observed patterns of neutrino mixing. In this study, we have examined a model within $A_4\times Z_3\times Z_{10}$ symmetry to estimate the neutrino masses using particle swarm optimization technique for both mass hierarchy of neutrino. This model employed a hybrid seesaw mechanism, a combination of seesaw mechanism of type-I and type-II, to establish the effective Majorana neutrino mass matrix. After calculating the mass eigenvalues and lepton mixing matrix upto second order perturbation theory in this framework, this study seeks to investigate the scalar potential for vacuum expectation values (VEVs), optimize the parameters, $U_{PMNS}$ matrix, neutrino masses: $|{m_{1}^{\prime}}^N|=0.0292794-0.0435082\ eV$, $|{m_{2}^{\prime}}^N|=1.78893\times 10^{-18}-0.0293509\ eV$, $|{m_{3}^{\prime}}^N|=0.0307414-0.0471467\ eV$, $|{m_{1}^{\prime}}^I|=0.00982013-0.0453623\ eV$, $|{m_{2}^{\prime}}^I_|=0.0379702-0.0471197\ eV$, and $|{m_{3}^{\prime}}^I|=0.0122063-0.027544\ eV$, effective neutrino mass parameters: $\langle {m_{ee}} \rangle^N=(0.170-3.93)\times10^{-2}\ eV$, $\langle {m_{\beta}} \rangle^N=(0.471-1.39)\times10^{-2}\ eV$, $\langle {m_{ee}} \rangle^I=(1.85-4.55)\times10^{-2}\ eV$ and $\langle {m_{\beta}} \rangle^I=(2.26-4.56)\times10^{-2}\ eV$, are predicted for both mass hierarchy through particle swarm optimization (PSO), showing strong agreement with recent experimental findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a thorough examination of the $xF_3$ structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering through a comprehensive QCD analysis. Our approach harnesses sophisticated mathematical techniques, namely the Mellin transform combined with Gegenbauer polynomials. We have employed the Jacobi polynomials approach for analysis, conducting investigations at three levels of precision: Next-to-Leading Order (NLO), Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (N$^2$LO), and Next-Next-Next-to-Leading Order (N$^3$LO). We have performed a comparison of our sets of valence-quark parton distribution functions with those of recent research groups, specifically CT18 and MSHT20 at NLO and N$^2$LO, and MSTH23 at N$^3$LO, which are concurrent with our current analysis. The combination of Mellin transforms with Gegenbauer polynomials proves to be a powerful tool for investigating the $xF_3$ structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering and the results obtained from our analysis demonstrate a favorable alignment with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Bound isoscalar axial-vector $bc\bar u\bar d$ tetraquark $T_{bc}$ from lattice QCD using two-meson and diquark-antidiquark variational basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a lattice QCD study of the heavy-light meson-meson interactions with an explicitly exotic flavor content $bc\bar u\bar d$, isospin $I\!=\!0$, and axialvector $J^P=1^+$ quantum numbers in search of possible tetraquark bound states. The calculation is performed at four values of lattice spacing, ranging $\sim$0.058 to $\sim$0.12 fm, and at five different values of valence light quark mass $m_{u/d}$, corresponding to pseudoscalar meson mass $M_{ps}$ of about 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 1.0, and 3.0 GeV. The energy eigenvalues in the finite-volume are determined through a variational procedure applied to correlation matrices built out of two-meson interpolating operators as well as diquark-antidiquark operators. The continuum limit estimates for $D\bar B^*$ elastic $S$-wave scattering amplitude are extracted from the lowest finite-volume eigenenergies, corresponding to the ground states, using amplitude parametrizations supplemented by a lattice spacing dependence. Light quark mass $m_{u/d}$ dependence of the $D\bar B^*$ scattering length ($a_0$) suggests that at the physical pion mass $a_0^{phys} = +0.57(^{+4}_{-5})(17)$ fm, which clearly points to an attractive interaction between the $D$ and $\bar B^*$ mesons that is strong enough to host a real bound state $T_{bc}$, with a binding energy of $-43(_{-7}^{+6})(_{-24}^{+14})$ MeV with respect to the $D\bar B^*$ threshold. We also find that the strength of the binding decreases with increasing $m_{u/d}$ and the system becomes unbound at a critical light quark mass $m^{*}_{u/d}$ corresponding to $M^{*}_{ps} = 2.73(21)(19)$ GeV.</description>

Abstract: We derive the set of inequalities that is necessary and sufficient for nonlinear causality and linear stability of first-order relativistic hydrodynamics with either a $U(1)_V$ conserved current or a $U(1)_A$ current with a chiral anomaly or both. Our results apply to generic hydrodynamic frames in which no relations among the transport parameters are imposed. Furthermore, our analysis yields, to the best of our knowledge, the first theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics proven to be causal and stable. We find that causality demands the absence of vorticity-induced heat flux, forcing a departure from the thermodynamic frame in the chiral case. The inequalities for causality and stability define a hypervolume in the space of transport parameters, wherein each point corresponds to a consistent formulation. Notably, causality is determined by just three combinations of transport parameters. We present our results in a form amenable to numerical hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Unstable Heavy Particles Using Deep Symmetry-Preserving Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing unstable heavy particles requires sophisticated techniques to sift through the large number of possible permutations for assignment of detector objects to the underlying partons. Anapproach based on a generalized attention mechanism, symmetry preserving attention networks (SPA-NET), has been previously applied to top quark pair decays at the Large Hadron Collider which produce only hadronic jets. Here we extend the SPA-NET architecture to consider multiple input object types, such as leptons, as well as global event features, such as the missing transverse momentum. Inaddition, we provide regression and classification outputs to supplement the parton assignment. We explore the performance of the extended capability of SPA-NET in the context of semi-leptonic decays of top quark pairs as well as top quark pairs produced in association with a Higgs boson. We find significant improvements in the power of three representative studies: a search for ttH, a measurement of the top quark mass, and a search for a heavy Z' decaying to top quark pairs. We present ablation studies to provide insight on what the network has learned in each case.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Entropy as a probe of Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of timelike entanglement entropy has sparked a lot of interest. Unlike the traditional spacelike entanglement entropy, timelike entanglement entropy involves tracing over a timelike subsystem. In this work, we propose an extension of timelike entanglement entropy to Euclidean space ("temporal entanglement entropy"), and relate it to the renormalization group (RG) flow. Specifically, we show that tracing over a period of Euclidean time corresponds to coarse-graining the system and can be connected to momentum space entanglement. We employ Holography, a framework naturally embedding RG flow, to illustrate our proposal. Within cutoff holography, we establish a direct link between the UV cutoff and the smallest resolvable time interval within the effective theory through the irrelevant $T\bar T$ deformation. Increasing the UV cutoff results in an enhanced capability to resolve finer time intervals, while reducing it has the opposite effect. Moreover, we show that tracing over a larger Euclidean time interval is formally equivalent to integrating out more UV degrees of freedom (or lowering the temperature). As an application, we point out that the temporal entanglement entropy can detect the critical Lifshitz exponent $z$ in non-relativistic theories which is not accessible from spatial entanglement at zero temperature and density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum fields confined to Lorentzian histories of freely falling networks in Minkowski spacetime probe entanglement properties of vacuum fluctuations that extend unrestricted across spacetime regions. Albeit instantaneous field configurations are localized on one-dimensional edges, angular momentum emerges on these network histories and establish the celebrated area scaling of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Physical Yukawa Couplings in Heterotic String Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the challenges of heterotic compactification on a Calabi-Yau threefold is to determine the physical $(\mathbf{27})^3$ Yukawa couplings of the resulting four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory. In general, the calculation necessitates knowledge of the Ricci-flat metric. However, in the standard embedding, which references the tangent bundle, we can compute normalized Yukawa couplings from the Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space of complex structure deformations of the Calabi-Yau manifold. In various examples (the Fermat quintic, the intersection of two cubics in $\mathbb{P}^5$, and the Tian-Yau manifold), we calculate the normalized Yukawa couplings for $(2,1)$-forms using the Weil-Petersson metric obtained from the Kodaira-Spencer map. In cases where $h^{1,1}=1$, this is compared to a complementary calculation based on performing period integrals. A third expression for the normalized Yukawa couplings is obtained from a machine learned approximate Ricci-flat metric making use of explicit harmonic representatives. The excellent agreement between the different approaches opens the door to precision string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Form Factors for Nucleons in Short-Range Correlations and the EMC effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between medium modifications of nucleon electromagnetic form factors and nucleon structure functions is examined using a model motivated by Light-Front Holographic QCD (LFHQCD). These modifications are closely connected with the influence of short-ranged correlations. The size of the modifications to nucleon form factors is shown to be about the same as the modifications to the structure functions. Thus, small limits on form factors modifications do not rule out an explanation of the EMC effect motivated by the influence of short range correlations, as claimed by a recent paper.</description>

      <title>Dressing vs. Fixing: On How to Extract and Interpret Gauge-Invariant Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is solid consensus among physicists and philosophers that, in gauge field theory, for a quantity to be physically meaningful or real, it must be gauge-invariant. Yet, every ``elementary" field in the Standard Model of particle physics is actually gauge-variant. This has led a number of researchers to insist that new manifestly gauge-invariant approaches must be established. Indeed, in the foundational literature, dissatisfaction with standard methods for reducing gauge symmetries has been expressed: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is deemed conceptually dubious, while gauge fixing suffers the same limitations and is subject to the same criticisms as coordinate choices in General Relativity.
  An alternative gauge-invariant proposal was recently introduced in the literature, the so-called ``dressing field method" (DFM). It is a mathematically subtle tool, and unfortunately prone to be confused with simple gauge transformations, hence with standard gauge~fixings. As a matter of fact, in the physics literature the two are often conflated, and in the philosophy community some doubts have been raised about whether there is any substantial difference between them. Clarifying this issue is of special significance for anyone interested in both the foundational issues of gauge theories and their invariant formulation. It is thus our objective to establish as precisely as possible the technical and conceptual distinctions between the DFM and gauge fixing.</description>
