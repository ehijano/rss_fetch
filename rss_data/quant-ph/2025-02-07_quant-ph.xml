      <title>Probing the nonclassical dynamics of a quantum particle in a gravitational field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the time evolution of particles is given by the Schr\"odinger equation. It is valid in a nonrelativistic regime where the interactions with the particle can be modelled by a potential and quantised fields are not required. This has been verified in countless experiments when the interaction is of electromagnetic origin, but also corrections due to the quantised field are readily observed. When the interaction is due to gravity, then one cannot expect to see effects of the quantised field in current-technology Earth-bound experiments. However, this does not yet guarantee that in the accessible regime, the time evolution is accurately given by the Schr\"odinger equation. Here we propose to measure the effects of an asymmetric mass configuration on a quantum particle in an interferometer. For this setup we show that with parameters within experimental reach, one can be sensitive to possible deviations from the Schr\"odinger equation, beyond the already verified lowest-order regime. Performing this experiment will hence directly test the nonclassical behaviour of a quantum particle in the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of free bosons and fermions in the hyperball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-particle systems pose commonly known computational challenges in quantum theory. The obstacles arise from the difficulty in finding sets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the underlying Hamiltonian while enforcing fermion or boson statistics, not to mention the prohibitive increase in the computational cost with the system's size. The first obvious step in this direction is to elaborate the theory for Fermi or Bose gases without inter-particle interactions. The traditional approach to the work is with the ideal gases confined in a cubic container with impenetrable walls (in arbitrary dimensions). This approach allows one to find the particle's spectra and compute all thermodynamic quantities of the confined gas. In the present work, we consider the gas confined in a spherical container (in other words, an infinitely deep spherical potential well in D dimensions), solving the corresponding Schroedinger equation using zero boundary conditions. We address the case of a finite number of particles N, either bosons or fermions, in the spherical potential box, as well as the thermodynamic limit. Owing to Weyl's relations, in the latter limit, the results do not depend on the shape of the box and thus approach the commonly known ones valid in the infinite space. Owing to the underlying SO(D) symmetry, we are dealing with particles carrying a well-defined angular momentum that, together with sorted energy eigenvalues, imparts a shell structure to the system.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Analog Preparation of Non-Equilibrium Quantum Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical preparation of exotic many-body quantum states is a persistent goal of analog quantum simulation, often limited by experimental coherence times. Recently, it was shown that fast, non-adiabatic Hamiltonian parameter sweeps can create finite-size ``lakes'' of quantum order in certain settings, independent of what is present in the ground state phase diagram. Here, we show that going further out of equilibrium via external driving can substantially accelerate the preparation of these quantum lakes. Concretely, when lakes can be prepared, existing counterdiabatic driving techniques -- originally designed to target the ground state -- instead naturally target the lakes state. We demonstrate this both for an illustrative single qutrit and a model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Rydberg quantum spin liquid. In the latter case, we construct experimental drive sequences that accelerate preparation by almost an order of magnitude at fixed laser power. We conclude by using a Landau-Ginzburg model to provide a semi-classical picture for how our method accelerates state preparation.</description>

      <title>Sharp Page transitions in generic Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the entanglement dynamics of a subsystem initialized in a pure state at high energy density (corresponding to negative temperature) and coupled to a cold bath. The subsystem's R\'enyi entropies $S_\alpha$ first rise as the subsystem gets entangled with the bath and then fall as the subsystem cools. We find that the peak of the min-entropy, $\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} S_\alpha$, sharpens to a cusp in the thermodynamic limit, at a well-defined time we call the Page time. We construct a hydrodynamic ansatz for the evolution of the entanglement Hamiltonian, which accounts for the sharp Page transition as well as the intricate dynamics of the entanglement spectrum before the Page time. Our results hold both when the bath has the same Hamiltonian as the system and when the bath is taken to be Markovian. Our ansatz suggests conditions under which the Page transition should remain sharp even for R\'enyi entropies of finite index $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Many-body non-Hermitian skin effect with exact steady states in dissipative lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Although the system involves many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetries offer a flexible approach to exactly constructing the steady state that demonstrates the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>The anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.</description>

      <title>Randomized measurements for multi-parameter quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal quantum measurements for estimating different unknown parameters in a parameterized quantum state are usually incompatible with each other. Traditional approaches to addressing the measurement incompatibility issue, such as the Holevo Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound, suffer from multiple difficulties towards practical applicability, as the optimal measurement strategies are usually state-dependent, difficult to implement and also take complex analyses to determine. Here we study randomized measurements as a new approach for multi-parameter quantum metrology. We show quantum measurements on single copies of quantum states given by 3-design perform near-optimally when estimating an arbitrary number of parameters in pure states and more generally, approximately low-rank states, whose metrological information is largely concentrated in a low-dimensional subspace. The near-optimality is also shown in estimating the maximal number of parameters for three types of mixed states that are well-conditioned on its support. Examples of fidelity estimation and Hamiltonian estimation are explicitly provided to demonstrate the power and limitation of randomized measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Dynamics on Near-Term Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of quantum dynamics are a key application of near term quantum computing, but are hindered by the twin challenges of noise and small device scale, which limit the executable circuit depths and the number of qubits the algorithm can be run on. Towards overcoming these obstacles we develop and implement a distributed variant of the projected Variational Quantum Dynamics which we dub dp-VQD, which allows to simultaneously alleviate circuit depth and width limitations. We employ the wire cutting technique, which can be executed on the existing devices without quantum or classical communication. We demonstrate the full variational training on noisy simulators, and execute and perform the reconstruction on real IBM quantum devices. The algorithm allows to execute Hamiltonian evolution simulations for problem sizes exceeding devices' nominal qubit counts, and to combine multiple small devices in a distributed computation. We test our approach on the Heisenberg and Hubbard model dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emulation of satellite up-link quantum communication with entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication rates in terrestrial quantum networks are fundamentally limited by fibre loss, even in the presence of quantum repeaters. Satellites offer a solution for long-distance communication, with the most commonly explored scenario involving prepare-and-measure protocols connecting from orbit to a trusted-node ground station via free-space down-links. In contrast, up-link scenarios allow for entanglement to be distributed between a satellite and remote end users in terrestrial networks, eliminating any trust requirement on the ground station. Here we demonstrate an ultra-bright source of far-non-degenerate entangled photons and perform quantum key distribution in emulated high-loss satellite scenarios. With a loss profile corresponding to that of one of the pioneering Micius up-link experiments, and a terrestrial end user separated by 10~km of telecom fibre we achieve secure key bit accumulation of 5.2~kbit in a single emulated overpass in the asymptotic limit. Our results confirm the viability of upcoming low-Earth orbit receiver satellite missions.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the generalized radial uncertainty product for the d-dimensional non-relativistic Hydrogen atom in position space. Utilizing the framework of quantum mechanics in d-dimensional spherical coordinates, the study extends the standard radial uncertainty relation to higher dimensions. Taking the solution of the radial Schrodinger equation, the normalized radial wave functions, expectation values, and uncertainties in both position and momentum space are rigorously evaluated. The analytical derivations reveal the dependence of the uncertainty product on the principal and angular quantum numbers, as well as the dimensional parameter d. The results provide deeper insight into the role of dimensionality in quantum uncertainty relations and their implications for higher-dimensional quantum systems</description>

      <title>Rapid comprehensive characterization of biphoton spatial-polarization hyperentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement across more than one degree of freedom (DoF), is a valuable resource in photonic quantum information technology. However, the lack of efficient characterization schemes hinders its quantitative study and application potential. Here, we present a rapid quantitative characterization of spatial-polarization hyperentangled biphoton state produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We first demonstrate rapid certification of the hyperentanglement dimensionality with a cumulative acquisition time of only 17 minutes. In particular, we verify transverse spatial entanglement through a violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion with a minimum conditional uncertainty product of $(0.11\pm0.05)\hbar$ and certify the entanglement dimensionality to be at least 148. Next, by performing spatially-resolved polarization state tomography of the entire field, we demonstrate the generation of an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303\pm0.0004$. Together, the results reveal a total dimensionality of at least 251, which is the highest dimensionality reported for hyperentanglement. These measurements quantitatively resolve the influence of the spatial correlations of the down-converted photons and the angular spectrum of the pump beam on the polarization entanglement. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Landauer principle: Thermodynamic criteria of transmitting classical information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmitting energy and information are two essential aspects of nature. Recent findings suggest they are closely related, while a quantitative equivalence between them is still unknown. This thus motivates us to ask: Can information transmission tasks equal certain energy transmission tasks? We answer this question positively by bounding various one-shot classical capacities via different energy transmission tasks. Such bounds provide the physical implication that, in the one-shot regime, transmitting $n$ bits of classical information is equivalent to $n\times k_BT\ln2$ transmitted energy. Unexpectedly, these bounds further uncover a dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between "transmitting" (rather than "erasing") information and energy. Finally, in the asymptotic regime, our findings further provide thermodynamic meanings for Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem and a series of strong converse properties as well as no-go theorems.</description>

Abstract: The native gate set is fundamental to the performance of quantum devices, as it governs the accuracy of basic quantum operations and dictates the complexity of implementing quantum algorithms. Traditional approaches to extending gate sets often require accessing multiple transitions within an extended Hilbert space, leading to increased control complexity while offering only a limited set of gates. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a unified and highly versatile gate scheme capable of natively generating arbitrary two-qubit gates using only exchange interaction and qubit driving on a superconducting quantum processor, achieving maximum expressivity. Using a state-of-the-art transmon-coupler-transmon architecture, we achieve high fidelities averaging $99.37 \pm 0.07\%$ across a wide range of commonly used two-qubit unitaries. This outstanding performance, combined with reduced complexity, enables precise multipartite entangled state preparation, as demonstrated. To further enhance its applicability, we also show the high-fidelity realization of the unique B gate, which efficiently synthesizes the entire family of two-qubit gates. Our results highlight that fully exploiting the capabilities of a single interaction can yield a comprehensive and highly accurate gate set. With maximum expressivity, gate-time optimality, demonstrated high fidelity, and easy adaptability to other quantum platforms, our unified control scheme paves the way for optimal performance in quantum devices, offering exciting prospects for advancing quantum hardware and algorithm development.</description>

      <title>Steady-state coherence in multipartite quantum systems: its connection with thermodynamic quantities and impact on quantum thermal machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how coherence of quantum systems affects thermodynamic quantities, such as work and heat, is essential for harnessing quantumness effectively in thermal quantum technologies. Here, we study the unique contributions of quantum coherence among different subsystems of a multipartite system, specifically in non-equilibrium steady states, to work and heat currents. Our system comprises two coupled ensembles, each consisting of $N$ particles, interacting with two baths of different temperatures, respectively. The particles in an ensemble interact with their bath either simultaneously or sequentially, leading to non-local dissipation and enabling the decomposition of work and heat currents into local and non-local components.We find that the non-local heat current, as well as both the local and non-local work currents,are linked to the system quantum coherence. We provide explicit expressions of coherence-related quantities that determine the work currents under various intrasystem interactions.Our scheme is versatile, capable of functioning as a refrigerator, an engine, and an accelerator, with its performance being highly sensitive to the configuration settings. These findings establish a connection between thermodynamic quantities and quantum coherence, supplying valuable insights for the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Sensing with Hybrid Exceptional-Diabolic Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an enhanced sensitivity for detecting linear perturbations near hybrid (doubly degenerated) exceptional-diabolic (HED) singular points in a four mode bosonic system. The sensitivity enhancement is attributed to a singular response function, with the pole order determining the scaling of estimation error. At HED singular points, the error scaling exhibits a twofold improvement over non-HED singular points. The ultimate bound on estimation error is derived via quantum Fisher information, with heterodyne detection identified as the measurement achieving this optimal scaling.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity and Quantumness in Thermodynamics: From Principles to Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of quantum mechanics on thermodynamics, particularly on the principles and designs of heat machines (HM), has been limited by the incompatibility of quantum coherent evolution with the dissipative, open-system nature of all existing HM and their basic structure, which has not been radically changed since Carnot. We have recently proposed a paradigm change whereby conventional HM functionality is replaced by that of few-mode coherent, closed systems with nonlinear, e.g. cross-Kerr, inter-mode couplings. These couplings allow us to coherently filter incident thermal noise, transforming it into a resource of work and information. Current technological advances enable heat engines, noise sensors or microscopes based on such designs to operate with thermal noise sources of few photons. This paradigm shift opens a path towards radically new understanding and exploitation of the relation between coherent, quantum or classical, evolution and thermodynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Pre-stack and post-stack seismic inversion using quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Quantum annealing, a specialized approach within quantum computing, is particularly effective for optimization tasks, as it leverages quantum tunneling to escape local minima and efficiently explore complex energy landscapes. In geosciences, many problems are framed as high-dimensional optimization problems, including seismic inversion, which aims to estimate subsurface impedances from seismic data for accurate geological interpretation and resource exploration. This study presents a novel application of quantum computing for seismic inversion, marking the first instance of inverting seismic data to estimate both P-wave and S-wave impedances using a quantum annealer. Building upon our prior work, which demonstrated the estimation of acoustic impedances from post-stack data using a two-step framework, we propose an enhanced workflow capable of inverting both post-stack and pre-stack seismic data in a single step. This advancement significantly reduces the number of qubits per model parameter (from 20 to 5) while improving computational speed (from 20 seconds to 6.3 seconds). The seismic inversion is implemented using the D-Wave Leap hybrid solver, achieving impedance estimation within 4-9 seconds, with the quantum processing unit (QPU) contributing just 0.043-0.085 seconds. Comparative analysis with simulated annealing reveals that quantum annealing produces impedance models closely matching true values in a single epoch, whereas simulated annealing requires 10 epochs for improved accuracy. These findings underscore the transformative potential of quantum computing for real-time, high-precision seismic inversion, marking a crucial step toward fully quantum-driven geophysical solutions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal characteristics of two-qubit gates and their argand diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the usefulness of the chords present in the argand diagram of squared eigenvalues of nonlocal part of two-qubit gates to study their nonlocal characteristics. We discuss about the criteria for perfect entanglers to transform a pair of orthonormal product states into a pair of orthonormal maximally entangled states. Perfect entanglers with a chord passing through origin can do such a transformation. We show that all the perfect entanglers with at least one chord passing through origin form five different planes of Weyl chamber. Perfect entanglers represented by each plane have unique entangling characteristics. We also provide the conditions for a perfect entangler not present in one of those five planes to transform a pair of orthonormal product states into orthonormal maximally entangled states. Finally, we show that similar to entangling power, gate typicality can also be described using the chords present in the argand diagram. For each chord describing the entangling power there exists a chord describing the gate typicality. We show the geometrical relation between the two sets of chords.</description>

      <title>Any theory that admits a Wigner's Friend type multi-agent paradox is logically contextual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner's Friend scenarios push the boundaries of quantum theory by modeling agents, along with their memories storing measurement outcomes, as physical quantum systems. Extending these ideas beyond quantum theory, we ask: in which physical theories, and under what assumptions, can agents who are reasoning logically about each other's measurement outcomes encounter apparent paradoxes? To address this, we prove a link between Wigner's Friend type multi-agent paradoxes and contextuality in general theories: if agents who are modeled within a physical theory come to a contradiction when reasoning using that theory (under certain assumptions on how they reason and describe measurements), then the theory must admit contextual correlations of a logical form. This also yields a link between the distinct fundamental concepts of Heisenberg cuts and measurement contexts in general theories, and in particular, implies that the quantum Frauchiger-Renner paradox is a proof of logical contextuality. Moreover, we identify structural properties of such paradoxes in general theories and specific to quantum theory. For instance, we demonstrate that theories admitting behaviors corresponding to extremal vertices of n-cycle contextuality scenarios admit Wigner's Friend type paradoxes without post-selection, and that any quantum Wigner's Friend paradox based on the n-cycle scenario must necessarily involve post-selection. Further, we construct a multi-agent paradox based on a genuine contextuality scenario involving sequential measurements on a single system, showing that Bell non-local correlations between distinct subsystems are not necessary for Wigner's Friend paradoxes. Our work offers an approach to investigate the structure of physical theories and their information-theoretic resources by means of deconstructing the assumptions underlying multi-agent physical paradoxes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers with a limited qubit connectivity require inserting SWAP gates for qubit routing, which increases gate execution errors and the impact of environmental noise due to an overhead in circuit depth. In this work, we benchmark various routing techniques considering random quantum circuits on one-dimensional and square lattice connectivities, employing both analytical and numerical methods. We introduce circuit fidelity as a comprehensive metric that captures the effects of SWAP and circuit depth overheads. Leveraging a novel approach based on the SABRE algorithm, we achieve up to $84\%$ higher average circuit fidelity for large devices within the NISQ range, compared to previously existing methods. Additionally, our results highlight that the optimal routing choice critically depends on the qubit count and the hardware characteristics, including gate fidelities and coherence times.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Design using a Progressive Widening Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) strongly depends on the choice of the parameterized quantum circuit to optimize. One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem and to the quantum hardware. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. It introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits have up to three times fewer CNOT gates.</description>

      <title>Optical interference by amplitude measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference effects are usually observed by intensity measurement. Path indistinguishability by quantum complementarity principle requires projection of the interfering fields into a common indistinguishable mode before detection. On the other hand, the essence of wave interference is the addition of amplitudes of the interfering fields. Therefore, if amplitudes can be directly measured and added, interference can occur even though the interfering fields are in well-distinguishable modes. Here, we make a comprehensive study in both theory and experiment of a technique by homodyne measurement of field amplitudes to reveal interference. This works for both classical and quantum fields even though there exists distinguishability in the interfering paths of light. This directly challenges complementarity principle. We present a resolution of this issue from the viewpoint of measurement that emphasizes either particle or wave. This technique is particularly useful for recovering interference in unbalanced interferometers with path-imbalance beyond coherence length of the input field and can be applied to remote sensing to extend applicable range. Since the amplitude-based interference phenomena studied here are fundamentally different from the traditional intenisty-based interference phenomena, our approach leads to a new paradigm to study coherence between optical fields.</description>

      <title>Modeling the laser-pulse induced helium trimer dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by ongoing pump-probe spectroscopy experiments, this work develops a theoretical framework for describing the rovibrational wave packet dynamics that ensues when a single weakly-bound van der Waals trimer is exposed to a short, sub-picosecond linearly polarized pump laser pulse. The intensity I of the pump laser is chosen such that excitation and ionization of the electronic degrees of freedom are negligible while excitation of the wavepacket in the nuclear degrees of freedom is non-negligible. The numerical treatment, which takes advantage of the fact that the laser pulse is very short compared to typical molecular time scales, is based on a wave packet decomposition that utilizes hyperspherical coordinates. The framework is applied to the extremely floppy bosonic helium trimer. A convergence analysis of the partial wave decomposition is conducted. The kinetic energy release and orientation dynamics are presented. While the dynamics of more strongly-bound van der Waals trimers such as, e.g., the argon trimer display negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture appropriate, those of weakly-bound trimers display non-negligible coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, rendering a description within a rigid-body picture inappropriate. It is shown that a model that constructs the helium trimer dynamics from the dynamics of the helium dimer captures a number of key characteristics of the alignment signal, including the interference between different angular momentum wave packet components.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express the dynamics of the two probability amplitudes in the elementary Landau-Zener problem in terms of the solution of the corresponding Riccati differential equation and identify three key features: (i) The solution of the Riccati equation provides the bridge between the two probability amplitudes. (ii) Neglecting the non-linearity in the Riccati equation is equivalent to the Markov approximation which yields the exact asymptotic expression for one of the probability amplitudes, and (iii) the Riccati equation identifies the origin of the failure of the Markov approximation not being able to provide us in general with the correct asymptotic expression of the other probability amplitude. Our approach relies on approximate yet analytical solutions of the Riccati equation in different time regimes, highlighting the impact of its non-linear nature on the time evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>Backflash Attack on Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution Protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we experimentally demonstrate an eavesdropper's (Eve's) information gain by exploiting the breakdown flash generated by the single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) used in coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) setup. Unlike prior studies focusing on the device-level characterization of backflash photons, this work quantifies Eve's learning with a QKD system that includes a key distillation engine (KDE). Eve's learning is quantified using the backflash photons emitted by SPAD and the information available on the classical channel. Experimentally observed data are in good agreement with theoretical simulations. Some mitigation strategies against the backflash attack are also discussed.</description>

      <title>DAPO-QAOA: An algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems by dynamically constructing phase operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a well-known hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. Improving QAOA involves enhancing its approximation ratio while addressing practical constraints of Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, such as minimizing the number of two-qubit gates and reducing circuit depth. Although existing research has optimized designs for phase and mixer operators to improve performance, challenges remain, particularly concerning the excessive use of two-qubit gates in the construction of phase operators. To address these issues, we introduce a Dynamic Adaptive Phase Operator (DAPO) algorithm, which dynamically constructs phase operators based on the output of previous layers and neighborhood search approach, optimizing the problem Hamiltonian more efficiently. By using solutions generated by QAOA itself to simplify the problem Hamiltonian at each layer, the algorithm captures the problem's structural properties more effectively, progressively steering the solution closer to the optimal target. Experimental results on MaxCut and NAE3SAT problems show that DAPO achieves higher approximation ratios and significantly reduces two-qubit RZZ gates, especially in dense graphs. Compared to vanilla QAOA, DAPO uses only 66% of RZZ gates at the same depth while delivering better results, demonstrating its potential for efficient combinatorial optimization in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Qualitative differences in the robust controllability of model two-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise implementation and manipulation of quantum gates is key to extracting advantages from future quantum technologies. Achieving this requires very accurate control over the quantum system. If one has complete knowledge about a Hamiltonian, accurate manipulation of the system is possible. However, in real scenarios, there will often be some uncertainty in the parameters of the Hamiltonian, which makes full control of the system either difficult or impossible. In this paper we consider two model Hamiltonians with a continuous parameter that is partly unknown. We assess robust controllability against this parameter uncertainty using existing theoretical frameworks and take a numerical route by discretizing the unknown parameter in the cases where we cannot predict controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a penalty term into the fidelity function to optimize control pulses, enhancing robustness against the influence of parameter fluctuations. Within our framework, we analyze the qualitative differences in the robust controllability of the two systems.</description>

      <title>Quadratic spin-phonon coupling and bipolarons in trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum simulation of quadratic spin-phonon coupling in a crystal of trapped ions. The coupling is implemented using tightly focused optical tweezers on each ion that change the local trapping potential in a state-dependent way. By encoding spins in the internal states of the ions and adding a tunneling term via M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen-type interactions, we calculate the emergence of mobile bipolarons driven by the zero-point energy of the ion crystal phonons. We show that thermal occupation may pin the bipolarons for ion crystals at finite temperature. Our scheme can be used to study and illustrate the emergence of mobile bipolarons as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Towards experimental demonstration of quantum position verification using true single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geographical position can be a good credential for authentication of a party, this is the basis of position-based cryptography - but classically this cannot be done securely without physical exchange of a private key. However, recently, it has been shown that by combining quantum mechanics with the speed of light limit of special relativity, this might be possible: quantum position verification. Here we demonstrate experimentally a protocol that uses two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference at a beamsplitter, which, in combination with two additional beam splitters and 4 detectors is rendering the protocol resilient to loss. With this we are able to show first results towards an experimental demonstration of quantum position verification.</description>

      <title>Gate teleportation-assisted routing for quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited qubit connectivity of quantum processors poses a significant challenge in deploying practical algorithms and logical gates, necessitating efficient qubit mapping and routing strategies. When implementing a gate that requires additional connectivity beyond the native connectivity, the qubit state must be moved to a nearby connected qubit to execute the desired gate locally. This is typically achieved using a series of SWAP gates creating a SWAP path. However, routing methods relying on SWAP gates often lead to increased circuit depth and gate count, motivating the need for alternative approaches. This work explores the potential of teleported gates to improve qubit routing efficiency, focusing on implementation within specific hardware topologies and benchmark quantum algorithms. We propose a routing method that is assisted by gate teleportation. It establishes additional connectivity using gate teleportation paths through available unused qubits, termed auxiliary qubits, within the topology. To optimize this approach, we have developed an algorithm to identify the best gate teleportation connections, considering their potential to reduce the depth of the circuit and address possible errors that may arise from the teleportation paths. Finally, we demonstrate depth reduction with gate teleportation-assisted routing in various benchmark algorithms, including case studies on the compilation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for heavy-hexagon topology used in IBM 127-qubit Eagle r3 processors. Our benchmark results show a 10-20 $\%$ depth reduction in the routing of selected algorithms compared to regular routing without using the teleported gate.</description>

      <title>Cyclic quantum causal modelling with a graph separation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal modelling frameworks link observable correlations to causal explanations, which is a crucial aspect of science. These models represent causal relationships through directed graphs, with vertices and edges denoting systems and transformations within a theory. Most studies focus on acyclic causal graphs, where well-defined probability rules and powerful graph-theoretic properties like the d-separation theorem apply. However, understanding complex feedback processes and exotic fundamental scenarios with causal loops requires cyclic causal models, where such results do not generally hold. While progress has been made in classical cyclic causal models, challenges remain in uniquely fixing probability distributions and identifying graph-separation properties applicable in general cyclic models. In cyclic quantum scenarios, existing frameworks have focussed on a subset of possible cyclic causal scenarios, with graph-separation properties yet unexplored. This work proposes a framework applicable to all consistent quantum and classical cyclic causal models on finite-dimensional systems. We address these challenges by introducing a robust probability rule and a novel graph-separation property, p-separation, which we prove to be sound and complete for all such models. Our approach maps cyclic causal models to acyclic ones with post-selection, leveraging the post-selected quantum teleportation protocol. We characterize these protocols and their success probabilities along the way. We also establish connections between this formalism and other classical and quantum frameworks to inform a more unified perspective on causality. This provides a foundation for more general cyclic causal discovery algorithms and to systematically extend open problems and techniques from acyclic informational networks (e.g., certification of non-classicality) to cyclic causal structures and networks.</description>

      <title>Frame-dependent coherence of a quantum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite-dimensional Hilbert space is usually described by using an orthonormal basis, but a more general description can be obtained by using a tight frame. The frame-dependent coherence, defined by following the analogy with the basis-dependent coherence, allows us to define the coherence with respect to several orthonormal bases considered simultaneously or with respect to a discrete system of coherent states. By using this more general definition, we can investigate how the basis-dependent coherence changes when we go from a basis to another one, from a basis to a complementary one. Frame-dependent coherence contains basis-dependent coherence as a particular case, but it allows a deeper description of coherence.</description>

      <title>Exploring operation parallelism vs. ion movement in ion-trapped QCCD architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion-trapped Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures have emerged as a promising alternative to scale single-trap devices by interconnecting multiple traps through ion shuttling, enabling the execution of parallel operations across different traps. While this parallelism enhances computational throughput, it introduces additional operations, raising the following question: do the benefits of parallelism outweigh the potential loss of fidelity due to increased ion movements?
  This paper answers this question by exploring the trade-off between the parallelism of operations and fidelity loss due to movement overhead, comparing sequential execution in single-trap devices with parallel execution in QCCD architectures. We first analyze the fidelity impact of both methods, establishing the optimal number of ion movements for the worst-case scenario. Next, we evaluate several quantum algorithms on QCCD architectures by exploiting parallelism through ion distribution across multiple traps. This analysis identifies the algorithms that benefit the most from parallel executions, explores the underlying reasons, and determines the optimal balance between movement overhead and fidelity loss for each algorithm.</description>

      <title>General theory of slow non-Hermitian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</description>

      <title>Casimir force inadequacy in explaining a strong attractive force in a micrometer-sized narrow-gap re-entrant cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pate et al. \cite{pate} investigated a macroscopic opto-mechanical system with a narrow-gap re-entrant cavity coupled to a SiN membrane resonator coated with Au or Nb. They observed a significant increase in the membrane's effective spring constant $k_{\rm eff}$ for sub-2-micron gaps $x$. This increase scales roughly with $x^{-4}$, suggesting an attractive force pulling the membrane towards the re-entrant Al post, with an $x^{-3}$ dependence. Attributing this force solely to the thermal Casimir effect is challenged by our detailed calculations (presented below). These calculations reveal that the Casimir force, at the investigated gap sizes, is orders of magnitude weaker than the observed force. This significant discrepancy necessitates an alternative explanation for the observed attraction.</description>

      <title>Variational decision diagrams for quantum-inspired machine learning applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) have emerged as an efficient tool for simulating quantum circuits due to their capacity to exploit data redundancies in quantum states and quantum operations, enabling the efficient computation of probability amplitudes. However, their application in quantum machine learning (QML) has remained unexplored. This paper introduces variational decision diagrams (VDDs), a novel graph structure that combines the structural benefits of DDs with the adaptability of variational methods for efficiently representing quantum states. We investigate the trainability of VDDs by applying them to the ground state estimation problem for transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg Hamiltonians. Analysis of gradient variance suggests that training VDDs is possible, as no signs of vanishing gradients--also known as barren plateaus--are observed. This work provides new insights into the use of decision diagrams in QML as an alternative to design and train variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Non-Variational Quantum Random Access Optimization with Alternating Operator Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving hard optimization problems is one of the most promising application domains for quantum computers due to the ubiquity of such problems in industry and the availability of broadly applicable quantum speedups. However, the ability of near-term quantum computers to tackle industrial-scale optimization problems is limited by their size and the overheads of quantum error correction. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) has been proposed to reduce the space requirements of quantum optimization. However, to date QRAO has only been implemented using variational algorithms, which suffer from the need to train instance-specific variational parameters, making them difficult to scale. We propose and benchmark a non-variational approach to QRAO based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for the MaxCut problem. We show that instance-independent ``fixed'' parameters achieve good performance, removing the need for variational parameter optimization. Additionally, we evaluate different design choices, such as various mixers and initial states, as well as QAOA operator implementations when customizing for QRAO, and identify a strategy that performs well in practice. Our results pave the way for the practical execution of QRAO on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Better Bounds for Quantum Optimization via Dynamical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide several quantum algorithms for continuous optimization that do not require any gradient estimation. Instead, we encode the optimization problem into the dynamics of a physical system and coherently simulate the time evolution. This allows us, in certain cases, to obtain exponentially better query upper bounds relative to the best known upper bounds for gradient-based optimization schemes which utilize quantum computers only for the evaluation of gradients. Our first two algorithms can find local optima of a differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by simulating either classical or quantum dynamics with friction via a time-dependent Hamiltonian. We show that these methods require $O(N\kappa^2/h_x^2\epsilon)$ queries to a phase oracle to find an $\epsilon$-approximate local optimum of a locally quadratic objective function, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the Hessian matrix and $h_x$ is the discretization spacing. In contrast, we show that gradient-based methods require $O(N(1/\epsilon)^{\kappa \log(3)/4})$ queries. Our third algorithm can find the global optimum of $f$ by preparing a classical low-temperature thermal state via simulation of the classical Liouvillian operator associated with the Nos\'e Hamiltonian. We use results from the quantum thermodynamics literature to bound the thermalization time for the discrete system. Additionally, we analyze barren plateau effects that commonly plague quantum optimization algorithms and observe that our approach is vastly less sensitive to this problem than standard gradient-based optimization. Our results suggests that these dynamical optimization approaches may be far more scalable for future quantum machine learning, optimization and variational experiments than was widely believed.</description>

      <title>Identifying hard native instances for the maximum independent set problem on neutral atoms quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization task that can be naturally mapped onto the Ising Hamiltonian of neutral atom quantum processors. Given its connection to NP-hard problems and real-world applications, there has been significant experimental interest in exploring quantum advantage for MIS. Pioneering experiments on King's Lattice graphs suggested a quadratic speed-up over simulated annealing, but recent benchmarks using state-of-the-art methods found no clear advantage, likely due to the structured nature of the tested instances. In this work, we generate hard instances of unit-disk graphs by leveraging complexity theory results and varying key hardness parameters such as density and treewidth. For a fixed graph size, we show that increasing these parameters can lead to prohibitive classical runtime increases of several orders of magnitude. We then compare classical and quantum approaches on small instances and find that, at this scale, quantum solutions are slower than classical ones for finding exact solutions. Based on extended classical benchmarks at larger problem sizes, we estimate that scaling up to a thousand atoms with a 1 kHz repetition rate is a necessary step toward demonstrating a computational advantage with quantum methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing the amplitude and range of couplings in quantum systems is a fundamental tool for exploring a large variety of quantum mechanical effects. Here, we consider off-resonant photon scattering processes on a geometrically shaped molecular cloud. Our analysis shows that such a setup is properly modeled by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian where the range, amplitude and sign of the tunneling processes of the scattered photonic modes can be accurately tuned. Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.</description>

      <title>Open transmission channels in multimode fiber cavities with random mode mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of light in disordered media is governed by open transmission channels, which enable nearly complete transmission of the incident power, despite low average transmission. Extensively studied in diffusive media and chaotic cavities, open channels exhibit unique properties such as universal spatial structure and extended dwell times. However, their experimental study is challenging due to the large number of modes required for control and measurement. We propose a multimode fiber cavity (MMFC) as a platform to explore open channels. Leveraging mode confinement and finite angular spread, MMFCs enable a full control over all channels. This allowed us to achieve an 18-fold power enhancement by selectively exciting an open channel with a transmission rate of $0.90 \pm 0.04$. By analyzing 100 transmission matrices of MMFC realizations, we observed a bimodal transmission eigenvalue distribution, indicating high channel control and low losses. The scalability of MMFCs, combined with long dwell times and potential for nonlinear phenomena, offers new opportunities for studying complex wave transport.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describe a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behavior expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Feynman-Kac formula within the deformation quantization program. Constructing on previous work it is shown that, upon a Wick rotation, the ground state energy of any prescribed physical system can be obtained from the asymptotic limit of the phase space integration of the star exponential of the Hamiltonian operator. Some examples of this correspondence are provided showing a novel and efficient way of computing the ground state energy for some physical models.</description>

      <title>Reed-Muller Codes on CQ Channels via a New Correlation Bound for Quantum Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether Reed-Muller (RM) codes achieve capacity on binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels has drawn attention since it was resolved positively for the binary erasure channel by Kudekar et al. in 2016. In 2021, Reeves and Pfister extended this to prove the bit-error probability vanishes on BMS channels when the code rate is less than capacity. In 2023, Abbe and Sandon improved this to show the block-error probability also goes to zero. These results analyze decoding functions using symmetry and the nested structure of RM codes. In this work, we focus on binary-input symmetric classical-quantum (BSCQ) channels and the Holevo capacity. For a BSCQ, we consider observables that estimate the channel input in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE). Using the orthogonal decomposition of these observables under a weighted inner product, we establish a recursive relation for the minimum MSE estimate of a single bit in the RM code. Our results show that any set of $2^{o(\sqrt{\log N})}$ bits can be decoded with a high probability when the code rate is less than the Holevo capacity.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Optimized, Fabrication Error-Tolerant Photonic Crystal Nanobeam Cavities for Scalable On-Chip Diamond Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity-enhanced diamond color center qubits can be initialized, manipulated, entangled, and read individually with high fidelity, which makes them ideal for large-scale, modular quantum computers, quantum networks, and distributed quantum sensing systems. However, diamond's unique material properties pose significant challenges in manufacturing nanophotonic devices, leading to fabrication-induced structural imperfections and inaccuracies in defect implantation, which hinder reproducibility, degrade optical properties and compromise the spatial coupling of color centers to small mode-volume cavities. A cavity design tolerant to fabrication imperfections, such as surface roughness, sidewall slant, and non-optimal emitter positioning, can improve coupling efficiency while simplifying fabrication. To address this challenge, a deep learning-based optimization methodology is developed to enhance the fabrication error tolerance of nanophotonic devices. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to promising designs, such as L2 and fishbone nanobeam cavities, predicting Q-factors up to one million times faster than traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, enabling efficient optimization of complex, high-dimensional parameter spaces. The CNNs achieve prediction errors below 3.99% and correlation coefficients up to 0.988. Optimized structures demonstrate a 52% reduction in Q-factor degradation, achieving quality factors of 5e4 under real-world conditions and a two-fold expansion in field distribution, enabling efficient coupling of non-optimally positioned emitters. This methodology enables scalable, high-yield manufacturing of robust nanophotonic devices, including the cavity-enhanced diamond quantum systems developed in this study.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Optimization with Continuous Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to variational Quantum algorithms (VQA) via continuous bandits. VQA are a class of hybrid Quantum-classical algorithms where the parameters of Quantum circuits are optimized by classical algorithms. Previous work has used zero and first order gradient based methods, however such algorithms suffer from the barren plateau (BP) problem where gradients and loss differences are exponentially small. We introduce an approach using bandits methods which combine global exploration with local exploitation. We show how VQA can be formulated as a best arm identification problem in a continuous space of arms with Lipschitz smoothness. While regret minimization has been addressed in this setting, existing methods for pure exploration only cover discrete spaces. We give the first results for pure exploration in a continuous setting and derive a fixed-confidence, information-theoretic, instance specific lower bound. Under certain assumptions on the expected payoff, we derive a simple algorithm, which is near-optimal with respect to our lower bound. Finally, we apply our continuous bandit algorithm to two VQA schemes: a PQC and a QAOA quantum circuit, showing that we significantly outperform the previously known state of the art methods (which used gradient based methods).</description>

      <title>Leading and beyond leading-order spectral form factor in chaotic quantum many-body systems across all Dyson symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) spectral correlations in the chaotic phase of generic periodically kicked interacting quantum many-body systems by analytically calculating spectral form factor (SFF), $K(t)$, up to two leading orders in time, $t$. We explicitly consider the presence or absence of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry to investigate all three Dyson's symmetry classes. Our derivation only assumes random phase approximation to enable ensemble average. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=1$, we show that beyond the Thouless time $t^*$, the SFF takes the form $K(t)\simeq 2t-2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to second order in time, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Hilbert space dimension. This is identical to the result from circular orthogonal ensemble of RMT. In the absence of $\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, we show that $K(t)\simeq t$ beyond $t^*$, and there is no universal term in the second order, unlike the $\mathcal{T}^2=1$ case, in agreement with the result of circular unitary ensemble. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=-1$, we show that $K(t)\simeq 2t+2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to two orders in time beyond $t^*$, in agreement with the result of circular symplectic ensemble. In all three cases, the system-size, $L$, scaling of $t^*$ is determined by eigenvalues of a doubly stochastic matrix $\mathcal{M}$. For strongly interacting fermionic chains, $\mathcal{M}$ is $SU(2)$ invariant in all three cases, leading to $t^*\propto L^2$ in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry. In the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, we find $t^*\propto L^0$, due to gapped non-degenerate second-largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{M}$ or $t^*\propto \ln(L)$ due to gapped second-largest eigenvalue with degeneracy $\propto L^\zeta$. Our calculation of SFF is plausible in higher space dimensions as well, where similar system-size scalings of $t^*$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Cyclic functional causal models beyond unique solvability with a graph separation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional causal models (fCMs) specify functional dependencies between random variables associated to the vertices of a graph. In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), fCMs are well-understood: a unique probability distribution on the random variables can be easily specified, and a crucial graph-separation result called the d-separation theorem allows one to characterize conditional independences between the variables. However, fCMs on cyclic graphs pose challenges due to the absence of a systematic way to assign a unique probability distribution to the fCM's variables, the failure of the d-separation theorem, and lack of a generalization of this theorem that is applicable to all consistent cyclic fCMs. In this work, we develop a causal modeling framework applicable to all cyclic fCMs involving finite-cardinality variables, except inconsistent ones admitting no solutions. Our probability rule assigns a unique distribution even to non-uniquely solvable cyclic fCMs and reduces to the known rule for uniquely solvable fCMs. We identify a class of fCMs, called averagely uniquely solvable, that we show to be the largest class where the probabilities admit a Markov factorization. Furthermore, we introduce a new graph-separation property, p-separation, and prove this to be sound and complete for all consistent finite-cardinality cyclic fCMs while recovering the d-separation theorem for DAGs. These results are obtained by considering classical post-selected teleportation protocols inspired by analogous protocols in quantum information theory. We discuss further avenues for exploration, linking in particular problems in cyclic fCMs and in quantum causality.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conference \emph{Black Holes Inside and Out} marked the 50th anniversary of Hawking's seminal paper on black hole radiance. It was clear already from Hawking's analysis that a proper quantum gravity theory would be essential for a more complete understanding of the evaporation process. This task was undertaken in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) two decades ago and by now the literature on the subject is quite rich. The goal of this contribution is to summarize a mainstream perspective that has emerged. The intended audience is the broader gravitational physics community, rather than quantum gravity experts. Therefore, the emphasis is on conceptual issues, especially on the key features that distinguish the LQG approach, and on concrete results that underlie the paradigm that has emerged. This is \emph{not} meant to be an exhaustive review. Rather, it is a broad-brush stroke portrait of the present status. Further details can be found in the references listed.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation for Probability Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the Dirac Notation in Quantum Mechanics (QM), we propose the Bracket Notation (PBN) by defining a probability-bra (P-bra), P-ket, P-bracket, P-identity, etc. Using the PBN, many formulae, such as normalizations and expectations in systems of one or more random variables, can now be written in abstract basis-independent expressions, which are easy to expand by inserting a proper P-identity. The time evolution of homogeneous Markov processes can also be formatted in such a way. Our system P-kets are identified with probability vectors, and our system P-bra is comparable to the Doi state function or the Peliti standard bra. In the Heisenberg picture of the PBN, a random variable becomes a stochastic process, and the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations are obtained by inserting a time-dependent P-identity. Also, some QM expressions in the Dirac notation are naturally transformed into probability expressions in PBN by a special Wick rotation. Potential applications show the usefulness of the PBN beyond the constrained domain and range of Hermitian operators on Hilbert Spaces in QM all the way to IT.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary time dynamics of topological modes in open planar quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nontrivial topological invariant of bulk electronic wavefunctions in two-dimensional quantum crystals leaves its footprints on the edge, dislocation, and corner modes. Here we investigate non-unitary time dynamics of these topological modes in square lattice-based open quantum systems in which the time-dependent Hamiltonian smoothly interpolates between topologically distinct insulators across band gap closing quantum critical points. The temporal dynamics of these modes is described by a Lindblad equation in which the instantaneous Hamiltonian plays the role of the Lindblad operator, thereby allowing the environment to couple with the system through the energy channels (weak measurement protocol). We show that in the presence of such a real time ramp, the survival probability of these modes decreases (increases) in short (long) time scale where the dephasing (quantum Zeno) effect dominates with the increasing amplitude of the system-to-environment coupling, for both slow and fast ramps from a topological to a normal insulating state. For a reverse course of the time evolution, the revival or condensation probability of nucleating such topological modes, otherwise absent in the initial system, increases for stronger system-to-environment coupling. This phenomenon can be attributed to the strong decoherence of the initial mixed state among all the energy eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian which also includes the topological modes, causing their enhanced condensation probability. Our findings can be germane to real open topological materials with time-tunable band gap, and should be applicable to open topological crystals of arbitrary dimension and belonging to any symmetry class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy transfer and information transmission are two fundamental aspects of nature. They are seemingly unrelated, while recent findings suggest that a deep connection between them is to be discovered. This amounts to asking: Can we phrase the processes of transmitting classical bits equivalently as specific energy-transmitting tasks, thereby uncovering foundational links between them? We answer this question positively by showing that, for a broad class of classical communication tasks, a quantum dynamics' ability to transmit $n$ bits of classical information is equivalent to its ability to transmit $n$ units of energy in a thermodynamic task. This finding not only provides an analytical correspondence between information transmission and energy extraction tasks, but also quantifies classical communication by thermodynamics. Furthermore, our findings uncover the dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between transmitting information and energy. In the asymptotic regime, our results further provide thermodynamic meanings for the well-known Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem in quantum communication theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is an important ingredient for scalable quantum computing. Stabilizer codes are one of the most promising and straightforward ways to correct quantum errors, are convenient for logical operations, and improve performance with increasing the number of qubits involved. Here, we propose a resource-efficient scaling of a five-qubit perfect code with increasing-weight cyclic stabilizers for small distances on the ring architecture, which takes into account the topological features of the superconducting platform. We show an approach to construct the quantum circuit of a correction code with ancillas entangled with non-neighboring data qubits. Furthermore, we introduce a neural network-based decoding algorithm supported by an improved lookup table decoder and provide a numerical simulation of the proposed code, which demonstrates the exponential suppression of the logical error rate.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. We recently proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Vector Atomic Magnetometer Using an Alternating Fast-Rotating Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a vector atomic magnetometer that employs a fast-rotating magnetic field applied to a pulsed $^{87}$Rb scalar atomic magnetometer. This approach enables simultaneous measurements of the total magnetic field and its two polar angles relative to the rotation plane. Operating in gradiometer mode, the magnetometer achieves a total field gradient sensitivity of 35 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ (0.7 parts per billion) and angular resolutions of 6 $\mathrm{nrad/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at a 50 $\mu$T Earth field strength. The noise spectra remain flat down to 1 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively. Here we show that this method overcomes several metrological challenges commonly faced by vector magnetometers and gradiometers. We propose a unique peak-altering modulation technique to mitigate systematic effects, including a newly identified dynamic heading error. Additionally, we establish the fundamental sensitivity limits of the sensor, demonstrating that its vector sensitivity approaches scalar sensitivity while preserving the inherent accuracy and calibration benefits of scalar sensors. This high-dynamic-range, ultrahigh-resolution magnetometer offers exceptional versatility for diverse applications.</description>

Abstract: Correlation is the basic mechanism of every measurement model, as one never accesses the measured system directly. Instead, correlations are created, codifying information about the measurable property into the environment. Here, we address the problem of the emergence of physical reality from the quantum world by introducing a model that interpolates between weak and strong non-selective measurements for qudits. By utilizing Heisenberg-Weyl operators, our model suggests that independently of the interaction intensity between the system and the environment, full information about the observable of interest can always be obtained by making the system interact with many environmental qudits, following a Quantum Darwinism framework.</description>

Abstract: Accurate simulations of vibrational molecular spectra are expensive on conventional computers. Compared to the electronic structure problem, the vibrational structure problem with quantum computers is less investigated. In this work we accurately estimate quantum resources, such as number of logical qubits and quantum gates, required for vibrational structure calculations on a programmable quantum computer. Our approach is based on quantum phase estimation and focuses on fault-tolerant quantum devices. In addition to asymptotic estimates for generic chemical compounds, we present a more detailed analysis of the quantum resources needed for the simulation of the Hamiltonian arising in the vibrational structure calculation of acetylene-like polyynes of interest. Leveraging nested commutators, we provide an in-depth quantitative analysis of trotter errors compared to the prior investigations. Ultimately, this work serves as a guide for analyzing the potential quantum advantage within vibrational structure simulations.</description>

      <title>Broadband biphoton source for quantum optical coherence tomography based on a Michelson interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broadband correlated photon pairs (biphotons) are valuable in quantum metrology, but current generation methods either involve complex nonlinear structures or lack sufficient bandwidth and brightness. In this work, we theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate a novel technique for generation of a bright collinear biphoton field with a broad spectrum, achieved by using a tightly focused pump in a bulk nonlinear crystal. As the most straightforward application of the source, we employ Michelson interferometer-based quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT). Utilizing the source enables the demonstration of record resolution and dispersion cancellation for this QOCT scheme.</description>

      <title>Rate Function Modelling of Quantum Many-Body Adiabaticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result in quantum mechanics, with a multitude of applications, both theoretical and practical. Here, we investigate the dynamics of adiabatic processes for quantum many-body systems %in detail by analysing the properties of observable-free, intensive quantities. In particular, we study the adiabatic rate function $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in dependence of the ramp time $T$, which gives us a complete characterization of the many-body adiabatic fidelity as a function of $T$ and the strength of the parameter displacement $\Delta \lambda$. $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ quantifies the deviation from adiabaticity for a given process and therefore allows us to control and define the notion of adiabaticity in many-body systems. First we study $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ for the 1D transverse field Ising model and the Luttinger liquid, both of which are quadratic systems and therefore allow us to look at the thermodynamic limit. For ramps across gapped phases, we relate $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ to the transition probability of the system and for ramps across a gapless point, or gapless phase we relate it to the excitation density of the relevant quasiparticles. Then we investigate the XXZ model which allows us to see the qualitative features that survive when interactions are turned on. Several key results in the literature regarding the interplay of the thermodynamic and the adiabatic limit are obtained as inferences from the properties of $f(T, \Delta \lambda)$ in the large $T$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen--type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the potential experimental relevance of our states by providing a protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator functions.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Classical algorithms for market equilibrium computation such as proportional response dynamics face scalability issues with Internet-based applications such as auctions, recommender systems, and fair division, despite having an almost linear runtime in terms of the product of buyers and goods. In this work, we provide the first quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation with sub-linear performance. Our algorithm provides a polynomial runtime speedup in terms of the product of the number of buyers and goods while reaching the same optimization objective value as the classical algorithm. Numerical simulations of a system with 16384 buyers and goods support our theoretical results that our quantum algorithm provides a significant speedup.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Faster computation of nonstabilizerness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of nonstabilizerness is fruitful due to its application in gate synthesis and classical simulation. In particular, the resource monotone called the stabilizer extent is a useful tool to estimate the simulation cost using rank-based simulators, one of the state-of-the-art simulators of Clifford+$T$ circuits. In this work, we propose faster numerical algorithms to compute the stabilizer extent. Our algorithm utilizes the Column Generation method, which iteratively updates the subset of pure stabilizer states used for calculation. This subset is selected based on the overlaps between all stabilizer states and a target state. In order to update the subset, we make use of a newly proposed subroutine for calculating the stabilizer fidelity that (i) achieves linear time complexity with respect to the number of stabilizer states, (ii) super-exponentially reduces the space complexity by in-place calculation, and (iii) prunes unnecessary states for the computation. As a result, our algorithm can compute the stabilizer fidelity and the stabilizer extent for Haar random pure states up to $n=9$ qubits, which naively requires a memory of 305 EiB. We further show that our algorithm runs faster when the target state vector is real. We prove that the problem size is reduced by $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ compared to the general cases, which makes it computable for the case of $n=10$ qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm to simulate the dynamics in quantum chemistry problems. It is based on adding fresh qubits at each Trotter step, which enables a simpler implementation of the dynamics in the extended system. After each step, the extra qubits are recycled, so that the whole process accurately approximates the correct unitary evolution. A key ingredient of the approach is an isometry that maps a simple, diagonal Hamiltonian in the extended system to the original one, and we give a procedure to compute this isometry. We estimate the error at each time step, as well as the number of gates, which scales as $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of orbitals. We illustrate our results with three examples: the Hydrogen chain, small molecules, and the FeMoco molecule. In the Hydrogen chain and the Hydrogen molecule we observe that the error scales in the same way as the Trotter error. For FeMoco, we estimate the number of gates in a fault-tolerant setup.</description>

Abstract: Krylov space methods provide an efficient framework for analyzing the dynamical aspects of quantum systems, with tridiagonal matrices playing a key role. Despite their importance, the behavior of such matrices from chaotic to integrable states, transitioning through an intermediate phase, remains unexplored. We aim to fill this gap by considering the properties of the tridiagonal matrix elements and the associated basis vectors for appropriate random matrix ensembles. We utilize the Rosenzweig-Porter model as our primary example, which hosts a fractal regime in addition to the ergodic and localized phases. We discuss the characteristics of the matrix elements and basis vectors across the three (ergodic, fractal, and localized) regimes and introduce tools to identify the transition points. The exact expressions of the Lanczos coefficients are provided in terms of $q$-logarithmic function across the full parameter regime. The numerical results are corroborated with analytical reasoning for certain features of the Krylov spectra. Additionally, we investigate the Krylov state complexity within these regimes, showcasing the efficacy of our methods in pinpointing these transitions.</description>

      <title>Teleportation of unknown qubit via Star type tripartite states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eylee Jung \textit{et.al}\cite{jung2008} had conjectured that $P_{max}=\frac{1}{2}$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the perfect two-party teleportation and consequently the Groverian measure of entanglement for the entanglement resource must be $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. It is also known that prototype $W$ state is not useful for standard teleportation. Agrawal and Pati\cite{pati2006} have successfully executed perfect (standard) teleportation with non-prototype $W$ state. Aligned with Pati's protocol\cite{pati2006} we have considered here $Star$ type tripartite states and have shown that perfect teleportation is suitable with such states. Moreover, we have taken the linear superposition of non-prototype $W$ state and its spin-flipped version and shown that it belongs to $Star$ class. Also, standard teleportation is possible with these states. It is observed that genuine tripartite entanglement is not necessary requirement for a state to be used as a channel for successful standard teleportation. We have also shown that these $Star$ class states are $P_{max}=\frac{1}{4}$ states and their Groverian entanglement is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, thus concluding that Jung conjecture is not a necessary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any given prescription of quantum time travel necessarily endows a Hilbert space to the chronology-violating (CV) system on the closed timelike curve (CTC). However, under the two foremost models, Deutsch's prescription (D-CTCs) and postselected teleportation (P-CTCs), the CV system is treated very differently: D-CTCs assign a definite form to the state on this system, while P-CTCs do not. To further explore this distinction, we present a methodology by which an operational notion of state may be assigned to their respective CV systems. This is accomplished via a conjunction of state tomography and weak measurements, with the latter being essential in leaving any notions of self-consistency intact. With this technique, we are able to verify the predictions of D-CTCs and, perhaps more significantly, operationally assign a state to the system on the P-CTC. We show that, for any given combination of chronology-respecting input and unitary interaction, it is always possible to recover the unique state on the P-CTC, and we provide a few specific examples in the context of select archetypal temporal paradoxes. We also demonstrate how this state may be derived from analysis of the P-CTC prescription itself, and we explore how it compares to its counterpart in the CV state predicted by D-CTCs.</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, our protocol deterministically entangles spatially localized modes that are not only distinguishable but are also individually accessible and amenable to state preparation and measurement, and therefore, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for deterministic quantum information processing with light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of probabilistic theories, termed Minimal Strongly Causal Operational Probabilistic Theories, where system dynamics are constrained to the minimal set of operations consistent with the set of states and permitting conditional tests. Specifically, the allowed instruments are limited to those derived from compositions of preparations, measurements, swap transformations, and conditional operations. We demonstrate that minimal theories with conditioning and a spanning set of non-separable states satisfy two quantum no-go theorems: no-information without disturbance and no-broadcasting. As a key example, we construct Minimal Strongly Causal Bilocal Classical Theory, a classical toy-theory that lacks incompatible measurements, preparation uncertainty relations, and is noncontextual (both Kochen-Specker and generalised), yet exhibits irreversibility of measurement disturbance, no-information without disturbance, and no-broadcasting. Therefore, the latter three properties cannot be understood $per se$ as signatures of non-classicality. We further explore distinctions between a theory and its minimal strongly causal counterpart, showing that while the minimal strongly causal version of quantum theory diverges from full quantum theory, the same does not hold for classical theory. Additionally, we establish the pairwise independence of the properties of simpliciality, strong causality, and local discriminability.</description>

Abstract: Classical neural networks with random initialization famously behave as Gaussian processes in the limit of many neurons, which allows one to completely characterize their training and generalization behavior. No such general understanding exists for quantum neural networks (QNNs), which -- outside of certain special cases -- are known to not behave as Gaussian processes when randomly initialized. We here prove that QNNs and their first two derivatives instead generally form what we call "Wishart processes," where certain algebraic properties of the network determine the hyperparameters of the process. This Wishart process description allows us to, for the first time: give necessary and sufficient conditions for a QNN architecture to have a Gaussian process limit; calculate the full gradient distribution, generalizing previously known barren plateau results; and calculate the local minima distribution of algebraically constrained QNNs. Our unified framework suggests a certain simple operational definition for the "trainability" of a given QNN model using a newly introduced, experimentally accessible quantity we call the "degrees of freedom" of the network architecture.</description>

      <title>Many-body adiabatic passage: Instability, chaos, and quantum classical correspondence</title>

Abstract: Adiabatic passage in systems of interacting bosons is substantially affected by interactions and inter-particle entanglement. We consider STIRAP-like schemes in Bose-Hubbard chains that exhibit low-dimensional chaos (a 3 site chain), and high-dimensional chaos (more than 3 sites). The dynamics that is generated by a transfer protocol exhibits striking classical and quantum chaos fingerprints that are manifest in the mean-field classical treatment, in the truncated-Wigner semiclassical treatment, and in the full many-body quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulability of Quantum Circuits with Shallow Magic Depth</title>

Abstract: Quantum magic is a necessary resource for quantum computers to be not efficiently simulable by classical computers. Previous results have linked the amount of quantum magic, characterized by the number of $T$ gates or stabilizer rank, to classical simulability. However, the effect of the distribution of quantum magic on the hardness of simulating a quantum circuit remains open. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of quantum circuits with alternating Clifford and $T$ layers across three tasks: amplitude estimation, sampling, and evaluating Pauli observables. In the case where all $T$ gates are distributed in a single layer, performing amplitude estimation and sampling to multiplicative error are already classically intractable under reasonable assumptions, but Pauli observables are easy to evaluate. Surprisingly, with the addition of just one $T$ gate layer or merely replacing all $T$ gates with $T^{\frac{1}{2}}$, the Pauli evaluation task reveals a sharp complexity transition from P to GapP-complete. Nevertheless, when the precision requirement is relaxed to 1/poly($n$) additive error, we are able to give a polynomial time classical algorithm to compute amplitudes, Pauli observable, and sampling from $\log(n)$ sized marginal distribution for any magic-depth-one circuit that is decomposable into a product of diagonal gates. Our research provides new techniques to simulate highly magical circuits while shedding light on their complexity and their significant dependence on the magic depth.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state classification and entanglement quantification are of significant importance in the fundamental research of quantum information science and various quantum applications. Traditional methods, such as quantum state tomography, face exponential measurement demands with increasing numbers of qubits, necessitating more efficient approaches. Recent work has shown promise in using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for quantum state analysis. However, existing ANNs may falter when confronted with states affected by dephasing noise, especially with limited data and computational resources. In this study, we employ a machine-learning approach to investigate the disentanglement process in two-qubit systems in the presence of dephasing noise. Our findings highlight the limitations of general state-trained ANNs in classifying states under dephasing noise. Specialized ANN algorithms, tailored for classifying states and quantifying entanglement in such noisy environments, demonstrate excellent performance using only a subset of tomographic features.</description>

      <title>Optical forces on atoms subject to higher-order Poincar\'e vortex modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of atoms with higher-order Poincar\'e optical vortex modes of order $m\geq 0$ is explored for light close to resonance with atomic dipole transitions. It is well-known that atoms subject to optical vortex modes experience both translational and rotational forces acting on the atomic centre of mass, leading to atom dynamics and atom trapping. Here we consider the optical forces on atoms immersed in general paraxial higher-order Poincar\'e optical vector modes. The coupling to atoms gives rise to wide-ranging scenarios involving such modes in which any specific polarisation is within a spectrum of wave polarisation and all the interactions are treatable within a single formulation. We show that this gives rise to a variety of physical situations, governed by the mode order $m$, the polarisation represented by the angular coordinates of the mode on the surface of the unit Poincar\'e sphere, the atomic transitions involved, and their selection rules. We present the analytical steps leading to the optical forces on sodium atoms and display their variations in various situations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Implementation of Non-Positive-Operator-Valued Measurements in General Probabilistic Theories by Post-Selected POVMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is important problem to clarify the class of implementable quantum measurements from both fundamental and applicable viewpoints. Positive-Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) measurements are implementable by the indirect measurement methods, and the class is the largest class determined by the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. However, if we assume probabilistic consistency in our operations instead of the structure of Hilbert space, we can deal with Non-Positive-Operator-Valued Measure (N-POVM) measurements in the framework of General Probabilistic Theories (GPTs). N-POVM measurements are not considered as implementable, but this paper gives a constructive way to implement N-POVM measurements by POVM measurements and post-selection in quantum theory when we restrict the domain of target states. Besides, we show that a post-selected POVM measurement is regarded as an N-POVM measurement in a restricted domain. These results provide a new relationship between N-POVM measurements in GPTs and post-selection.</description>

Abstract: We use operators from generalized equiangular measurements to construct positive maps. Their positivity follows from the inequality for indices of coincidence corresponding to few equiangular tight frames. These maps give rise to entanglement witnesses, which include as special cases many important classes considered in the literature. Additionally, we introduce separability criteria based on the correlation matrix and analyze them for various types of measurements.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation with relativistic mass: a relativistic Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon equation describes the wave-like behavior of spinless particles since it is Lorentz invariant. While it seemed initially ripe for explaining the electronic structure of the hydrogen atom, the lack of a unconditional positive probability density really limited its applications. Yet, it is intimately connected with fermions. Any solution to the Dirac equation is automatically a solution to the Klein-Gordon equation. What is even more surprising, the Klein-Gordon equation for a free particle turns into the Schr\"odinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. In this work we show that these problems disappear when we use the relativistic mass instead of the rest mass. While the Klein-Gordon equation losses its Lorentz invariance because of this transformation, it gains most of the features present the Schr\"odinger equation, including the unconditional positivity of probability density, while keeping most of its relativistic characteristics intact, including the matter-wave dispersion relation. What is even more surprising, the non-relativistic, quasi-static limit of the Klein-Gordon equation with relativistic mass is simply the Schr\"odinger equation under all possible conditions. So, it can be argued that this Klein-Gordon equation is a sort of relativistic Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Recurrence in discrete-time quantum stochastic walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interplay between quantum interference and classical randomness can enhance performance of various quantum information tasks. In the present paper we analyze recurrence phenomena in the discrete-time quantum stochastic walk on a line, which is a quantum stochastic process that interpolates between quantum and classical walk dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that introducing classical randomness can reduce the recurrence probability -- despite the fact that the classical random walk returns with certainty -- and we identify the conditions under which this intriguing phenomenon occurs. Numerical evaluation of the first-return generating function allows us to investigate the asymptotics of the return probability as the step number approaches infinity. This provides strong evidence that the suppression of recurrence probability is not a transient effect but a robust feature of the underlying quantum-classical interplay in the asymptotic limit. Our results show that for certain tasks discrete-time quantum stochastic walks outperform both classical random walks and unitary quantum walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a specially constructed set of hard 2-SAT problems with four satisfying assignments, we study the scaling and sampling performance of numerical simulation of quantum annealing as well as that of the physical quantum annealers offered by D-Wave. To this end, we use both the standard quantum annealing and reverse annealing protocols in both our simulations and on the D-Wave quantum annealer. In the case of ideal quantum annealing the sampling behavior can be explained by perturbation theory and the scaling behavior of the time to solution depends on the scaling behavior of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the annealing Hamiltonian. The corresponding results from the D-Wave quantum annealers do not fit to this ideal picture, but suggest that the scaling of the time to solution from the quantum annealers matches those calculated from the equilibrium probability distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization entangled photons are the key ingredients of various protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. In particular, for key distributions, a near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is one of the requirements for minimizing the qubit error rates. In this work, we theoretically investigate the polarization entangled photon pairs emitted by a quantum-dot radiative cascade embedded in a micropillar cavity. We develop a polaron master equation theory for incorporating the unavoidable exciton-phonon coupling and investigate the role of phonon-mediated processes and phonon-bath temperature on the degree of entanglement. We show that the phonon-coupling introduces the one-photon and two-photon incoherent processes, as well as the cross-coupling between the two exciton states. It is shown that the phonon-mediated coupling along with the ac-Stark shift and multiphoton emission significantly degrade the entanglement at higher temperatures. Finally, we consider a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol to investigate the qubit error rate for the given degree of entanglement.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between thermodynamics, general relativity and quantum mechanics has long intrigued researchers. Recently, important advances have been obtained in thermodynamics, mainly regarding its application to the quantum domain through fluctuation theorems. In this letter, we apply Fermi normal coordinates to report a fully general relativistic detailed quantum fluctuation theorem based on the two point measurement scheme. We demonstrate how the spacetime curvature can produce entropy in a localized quantum system moving in a general spacetime. The example of a quantum harmonic oscillator living in an expanding universe is presented. This result implies that entropy production is strongly observer dependent and deeply connects the arrow of time with the causal structure of the spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Sharp electromagnetically induced absorption via balanced interferometric excitation in a microwave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cylindrical TM$_{0,1,0}$ mode microwave cavity resonator was excited using a balanced interferometric configuration that allowed manipulation of the electric field and potential within the resonator by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the interferometer arms driving the resonator. With precise tuning of the phase and amplitude, 25 dB suppression of the electric field at the resonance frequency was achieved while simultaneously resonantly enhancing the time-varying electric-scalar potential. Under these conditions, the system demonstrated electromagnetically induced absorption in the cavity response due to the annulment of the electric field at the resonance frequency. This phenomena can be regarded as a form of extreme dispersion, and led to a sharp increase in the cavity phase versus frequency response by an order of magnitude when compared to the cavity Q-factor. This work presents an experimental setup that will allow the electric-scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect to be tested under conditions involving a time-varying electric-scalar potential, without the presence of an electric field or magnetic vector potential, an experiment that has not yet been realised.</description>

Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a static Unruh-DeWitt detector in two $(2+1)$-dimensional black hole spacetimes that are isometric to the static Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole outside the horizon but have no asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter exterior behind the horizon. The spacetimes are the $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon, with spatial topology $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$, and the Swedish geon of \AA{}minneborg \emph{et al\/}, with spatial topology $T^{2}\setminus\{\text{point at infinity}\}$. For a conformal scalar field, prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-type state that is induced from the global vacuum on the anti-de Sitter covering space, we show numerically that the detector's transition rate distinguishes the two spacetimes, particularly at late exterior times, and we trace this phenomenon to the differences in the isometries that are broken by the quotient construction from the universal covering space. Our results provide an example in which information about the interior topology of a black hole is accessible to a quantum observer outside the black hole.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dots (DQD) coupled to superconducting microwave resonators offer a promising platform for the detection of single microwave photons. In previous works, the photodetection was studied for a monochromatic source of microwave photons. Here, we theoretically analyze the photodetection of single microwave pulses. The photodetection in this case can be seen as a non-linear filtering process of an incoming signal, the pulse, to an outgoing one, the photocurrent. This analogy to signal processing motivated the derivation of a Wigner-function formalism which provides a compelling visualization of the time and frequency properties of the photodetector for low intensities. We find a trade-off between detecting the time and the frequency of the incoming photons in agreement with the time-energy uncertainty relation. As the intensity of the source increases, the photodetection is influenced by coherent Rabi oscillations of the DQD. Our findings give insight into the time-dependent properties of microwave photons interacting with electrons in a DQD-resonator hybrid system and provide guidance for experiments on single microwave pulse detection.</description>

      <title>Electron hopping induced phonon pumping in opto-mechanical molecular nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic molecular nanojunctions exhibit opto-mechanical coupling at the nanoscale, enabling intertwined optical, vibrational and electronic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate plasmon-mediated phonon pumping, driven by inelastic electron hopping in conductive molecules, which results in strong Raman nonlinearity at the light intensities almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional opto-mechanical systems and up to four-fold enhancement of the effective Raman polarizability due to vibrational electron-phonon coupling. We also developed a microscopic framework of opto-mechanical electron-phonon coupling in molecular nanojunctions based on the Marcus electron hopping. Systematically varying electrical conductance of the molecules in the junction and laser intensity, we observed the transition between a photo-assisted tunnelling regime and an electron hopping process. Our findings provide a microscopic description for vibrational, optical, and electronic phenomena in plasmonic nanocavities important for efficient phonon lasing, representing the first attempt to exploit conductive molecules as quantum-mechanical oscillators.</description>

      <title>Symmetric tensor scars with tunable entanglement from volume to area law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation of quantum information over long distances requires robust entanglement on the macroscopic scale. The construction of highly energetic eigenstates with tunable long-range entanglement can provide a new medium for information transmission. Using a symmetric superposition of the antipodal triplet states, we construct polynomially many exact zero-energy eigenstates for a class of non-integrable spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with two-body interactions. These states exhibit non-thermal correlations, and by tuning the distribution of triplets we induce extensive, logarithmic, or area-law entanglement. Quasiparticle excitations in this manifold converge to be exact quantum many-body scars in the thermodynamic limit. This framework has a natural extension to higher dimensions, where entangled states controlled by lattice geometry and internal symmetries can result in new classes of correlated out-of-equilibrium quantum matter. Our results provide a new avenue for entanglement control and quantum state constructions.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of heuristic approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5% for much more rugged planted-solution instances. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1% and approximation ratios of about 72-88%. A theoretical implication of our algorithm is that only quantum algorithms with sublinear time complexity may have time-complexity quantum advantage for heuristic approximate optimization of classical spin glasses that have decaying correlations. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>
