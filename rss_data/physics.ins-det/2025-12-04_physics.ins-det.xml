      <title>Kaleidoscopic Scintillation Event Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillators are transparent materials that interact with high-energy particles and emit visible light as a result. They are used in state of the art methods of measuring high-energy particles and radiation sources. Most existing methods use fast single-pixel detectors to detect and time scintillation events. Cameras provide spatial resolution but can only capture an average over many events, making it difficult to image the events associated with an individual particle. Emerging single-photon avalanche diode cameras combine speed and spatial resolution to enable capturing images of individual events. This allows us to use machine vision techniques to analyze events, enabling new types of detectors. The main challenge is the very low brightness of the events. Techniques have to work with a very limited number of photons.
  We propose a kaleidoscopic scintillator to increase light collection in a single-photon camera while preserving the event's spatial information. The kaleidoscopic geometry creates mirror reflections of the event in known locations for a given event location that are captured by the camera. We introduce theory for imaging an event in a kaleidoscopic scintillator and an algorithm to estimate the event's 3D position. We find that the kaleidoscopic scintillator design provides sufficient light collection to perform high-resolution event measurements for advanced radiation imaging techniques using a commercial CMOS single-photon camera.

      <title>Compton suppressed scintillation spectrometer based on a cluster of 9$\times$CeBr$_{3}$-NaI(Tl) phoswich detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the characteristics of an Compton suppressed spectrometer consisting of 9$\times$CeBr$_{3}$-NaI(Tl) phoswich detectors surrounded by four CsI(Tl) scintillation detectors intended for suppressing the Compton component of the spectrum have been carried out. Measurements were performed using gamma and neutron radiation sources. Key parameters of the spectrometer have been determined: the suppression factor of the Compton part of the $\gamma$-spectrum, as well as the dependencies of the neutron detection efficiency on their energy at various detection threshold values.</description>

      <title>Studying the GRAiNITA concept: first test beam results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data collected over a two-day period in June 2024 at the CERN SPS H9 test beam using a small-scale GRAiNITA prototype have been analyzed to characterize the detector's energy resolution performance. The measurements allow for a first estimate of the constant term associated with detector non-uniformity. Although the evaluation is limited by the small prototype size and the use of pion beams, the results indicate that the non-uniformity-related constant term is significantly below 1%. Furthermore, the test-beam data confirm that the contribution to the energy resolution arising from photo-electron statistics is approximately 1%/sqrt(E). These findings validate the expected calorimetric performance of the GRAiNITA concept and provide important input for the design and optimization of future full-scale detectors.</description>

      <title>Poly- and single-crystalline diamond nitrogen-induced TLS losses estimation with superconducting lumped elements micro-resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on diamond has intensified due to its exceptional thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, making it a key material in quantum technologies and high-power applications. Diamonds with engineered nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers represent a very sensitive platform for quantum sensing, while high-optical quality diamond windows represent a fundamental safety component inside Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) systems in nuclear fusion reactors. A major challenge is the development of ultra-low-loss, high-optical-quality single-crystal diamond substrates to meet growing demands for quantum coherence and power handling. Traditionally, dielectric losses ($\tan \delta$) in diamonds are evaluated using Fabry-Perot microwave resonators, in which the resonance quality factors Q of the cavity with and without the sample are compared. These devices are limited to resolutions around 10$^{-5}$ by the need to keep the resonator dimensions within a reasonable range. In contrast, superconducting thin-film micro-strip resonators, with Q factors exceeding 10$^6$, are stated to provide higher sensitivity for assessing ultra-low-loss materials. This study examines four diamond samples grown through different processes, analyzing their dielectric losses at extreme low temperatures (sub-Kelvin) within the Two-Level System (TLS) framework. Complementary Raman spectroscopy measurements allowed us not only to associate higher nitrogen content with increased losses, but also to investigate how the different growth process influence the way these defects are incorporated in the crystal lattice.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments of the VOXES Von Hamos X-ray Spectrometer for Laboratory XES and XAS Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VOXES is a Von Hamos X-ray spectrometer developed at the INFN National Laboratories of Frascati for high-resolution laboratory X-ray spectroscopy in the 5--20~keV range. It uses curved mosaic crystals and motorized positioning stages to perform wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WD-XRF) with sub-10~eV tunable resolution for extended and dilute samples. Recent developments include the integration of an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) line based on a silicon pin-diode detector, which enables flux monitoring and simultaneous ED and WD measurements. In addition, a dedicated liquid-sample holder has been introduced, and a Y-shaped support geometry, crucial for switching to a transmission layout, provides mechanical compatibility with laboratory XAS, now under implementation. These upgrades expand the versatility and automation of VOXES, strengthening its role as a table-top platform for laboratory X-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&amp;D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising, also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Readout noise of digital frequency multiplexed TES detectors for CUPID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors have been the standard in Cosmic Microwave Background experiments for almost two decades and are now being adapted for use in nuclear physics, such as neutrinoless double beta decay searches. In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency multiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy resolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept to a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout SQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful consideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency multiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly designed frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a noise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID coil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output wiring, worsen the readout noise of the system. To meet noise requirements, a SQUID with a low input inductance, high transimpedance and/or low dynamic impedance is needed, and the wiring capacitance should be kept as small as possible. Alternatively, the option of adding a cryogenic low-noise amplifier at the output of the SQUID should be explored.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic geometric anti-spring vibration isolation system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of low temperature and low vibration levels is key for ultrasensitive sensing applications such as scanning probe microscopy, large-mass quantum mechanics, and gravitational wave detection. Unfortunately, closed-cycle cryostats using pulse tube or GM coolers introduce strong low-frequency vibrations starting at 1 Hz. Mass-spring systems allow passive isolation, but for low-frequency applications the required spring constants and masses become impractical. Blade-based geometric anti-spring systems are compact isolators that operate from sub-Hz frequencies, but have not been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we characterize a geometric anti-spring system tuned to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Our cryogenic filter uses radially arranged titanium blade springs whose effective spring constant can be tuned in-situ using a magnetic actuator. Our system achieves a vertical resonance frequency of 185 mHz at 7K, which allows reduction of vibrations at the problematic 1 Hz cooler frequency by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>SynradG4: A Geant4-Based Extension for Synchrotron Radiation Background Studies in the ePIC Detector at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will operate at high luminosity with multi-GeV, high-current electron beams, resulting in substantial synchrotron radiation (SR) emission in the electron storage ring (ESR). A detailed understanding of SR photon transport in the complex three-dimensional interaction region (IR) geometry is critical for estimating backgrounds in the ePIC detector and for developing effective shielding and masking strategies.
  This paper presents SynradG4, an EIC-specific extension of Geant4 designed for fast photon tracking in vacuum using established SR reflection and rough surface scattering models. SynradG4 integrates the photon reflection models of Synrad+ within the Geant4 geometry and field framework, while disabling all bulk matter interactions to achieve high-statistics transport through the 50-m-long IR vacuum system. Absorbed photon coordinates are then passed to a second-stage DD4hep simulation, where full electromagnetic processes such as photoabsorption, Compton scattering, Rayleigh scattering, and fluorescence are enabled for propagation through the beam pipe and detector materials.
  SynradG4 is not intended to replace general SR simulation codes; rather, it complements them by providing the workflow and geometry integration capabilities needed for EIC-specific background studies. Benchmark tests against Synrad+, Synrad3D, and the native Geant4 X-ray reflection model demonstrate excellent agreement for specular and diffuse reflection regimes. Using the full IR geometry and machine lattice, we present the first SR background estimates for the ePIC detector and evaluate the impact of potential SR masks.</description>
