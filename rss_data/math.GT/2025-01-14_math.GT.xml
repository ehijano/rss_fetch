      <title>Bordered algebras and the wrapped Fukaya category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an isomorphism between endomorphism algebras from the wrapped Fukaya category of a type of punctured surface, and the class of A-infinity algebras related to bordered knot Floer homology, called star algebras, which the author first constructed in her previous work. By viewing the star algebras as A-infinity deformations of underlying associative algebras and making several calculations with Hochschild cohomology, we verify that the star algebras are unique with a given set of generators and basic A-infinity relations. We then make model calculations in order to establish that the endomorphism algebras have these generators and basic operations, so that the desired isomorphism follows.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new equivalence relation, named R-equivalence relation, on the set of colorings of an oriented knot diagram by a quandle. We determine the R-equivalence classes of colorings of a diagram of a torus knot by a quandle, called $\mathrm{Rot} \mathbb{E}^{2}$, under a certain condition.</description>

      <title>Black holes in the Dynnikov Coordinate Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an application of Dynnikov coordinates in geometric group theory. We describe the orbits and dynamics of the action of Dehn twists $t_c$ and $t_d$ in the Dynnikov coordinate plane for a thrice-punctured disc $M$, where $c$ and $d$ are simple closed curves with Dynnikov coordinates $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$, respectively. This action has an interesting geometric meaning as a piecewise linear $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$-automorphism preserving the shape of the linearity border fan.</description>

      <title>Lodha--Moore groups and its $n$-adic generalization are not SCY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A closed 4-manifold is symplectic Calabi--Yau (SCY) if its canonical class is trivial. Friedl and Vidussi proved that Thompson's group $F$ cannot be the fundamental group of any SCY manifold. In this paper, we show that its generalizations, called the Brown--Thompson group and the $n$-adic Lodha--Moore groups, cannot be also the fundamental group of any SCY manifold by using their method. From this proof, we also show that there exist non-trivial infinitely many examples which satisfy Geoghegan's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Ribbonness of a stable-ribbon surface-link, II. General case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that any handle-irreducible summand of every stable-ribbon surface-link is a unique ribbon surface-link up to equivalences, so that every stable-ribbon surface-link is a ribbon surface-link. This is a generalization of a previously observed result for a stably trivial surface-link. Two observations are given. One observation is that a connected sum of two surface-links is a ribbon surface-link if and only if both the connected summands are ribbon surface-links. The other observation is a characterization of when a surface-link consisting of ribbon surface-knot components becomes a ribbon surface-link.</description>

      <title>Stallings's Fibring Theorem and $\mathrm{PD}^3$-pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a relatively self-contained proof that if a group $G$ fibres algebraically and is part of a $\mathrm{PD}^3$-pair, then $G$ is the fundamental group of a fibred compact aspherical 3-manifold. This yields a homological proof of a classical theorem of Stallings: if $G = \pi_1(M^3)$ is the fundamental group of a compact irreducible 3-manifold $M^3$ and $\phi \colon G \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a surjective homomorphism with finitely generated kernel, then $\phi$ is induced by a topological fibration of $M^3$ over the circle.</description>

Abstract: We show that, up to connected sums with integer homology $L$-spaces, bordered Floer homology detects handlebodies, as well as whether a mapping class extends over a given handlebody or compression body. Using this, we combine ideas of Casson-Long with the theory of train tracks to give an algorithm using bordered Floer homology to detect whether a mapping class extends over any compression body.</description>

      <title>Dual structures on Coxeter and Artin groups of rank three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups to all rank-three Coxeter systems, beyond the previously studied spherical and affine cases. Using geometric, combinatorial, and topological techniques, we show that rank-three noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable lattices and give rise to Garside groups isomorphic to the associated standard Artin groups. Within this framework, we prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture, the triviality of the center, and the solubility of the word problem for rank-three Artin groups. Some of our constructions apply to general Artin groups; we hope they will help develop complete solutions to the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture and other open problems in the area.</description>

      <title>Conformal dynamics at infinity for groups with contracting elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04861v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of conformal density at infinity for groups with contracting elements. We start by introducing a class of convergence boundary encompassing many known hyperbolic-like boundaries, on which a detailed study of conical points and Myrberg points is carried out. The basic theory of conformal density is then established on the convergence boundary, including the Sullivan shadow lemma and a Hopf--Tsuji--Sullivan dichotomy. This gives a unification of the theory of conformal density on the Gromov and Floyd boundary for (relatively) hyperbolic groups, the visual boundary for rank-1 CAT(0) groups, and Thurston boundary for mapping class groups. Besides that, the conformal density on the horofunction boundary provides a new important example of our general theory. Applications include the identification of Poisson boundary of random walks, the co-growth problem of divergent groups, measure theoretical results for CAT(0) groups and mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Resonant forms at zero for dissipative Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study resonant differential forms at zero for transitive Anosov flows on $3$-manifolds. We pay particular attention to the dissipative case, that is, Anosov flows that do not preserve an absolutely continuous measure. Such flows have two distinguished Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen $3$-forms, $\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}$, and the cohomology classes $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ (where $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the flow) play a key role in the determination of the space of resonant $1$-forms. When both classes vanish we associate to the flow a $\textit{helicity}$ that naturally extends the classical notion associated with null-homologous volume preserving flows. We provide a general theory that includes horocyclic invariance of resonant $1$-forms and SRB-measures as well as the local geometry of the maps $X\mapsto [\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ near a null-homologous volume preserving flow. Next, we study several relevant classes of examples. Among these are thermostats associated with holomorphic quadratic differentials, giving rise to quasi-Fuchsian flows as introduced by Ghys. For these flows we compute explicitly all resonant $1$-forms at zero, we show that $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]=0$ and give an explicit formula for the helicity. In addition we show that a generic time change of a quasi-Fuchsian flow is semisimple and thus the order of vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function at zero is $-\chi(M)$, the same as in the geodesic flow case. In contrast, we show that if $(M,g)$ is a closed surface of negative curvature, the Gaussian thermostat driven by a (small) harmonic $1$-form has a Ruelle zeta function whose order of vanishing at zero is $-\chi(M)-1$.</description>

      <title>Genus one singularities in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for certain one-parameter families of initial conditions in $\mathbb R^3$, when we run mean curvature flow, a genus one singularity must appear in one of the flows. Moreover, such a singularity is robust under perturbation of the family of initial conditions. This contrasts sharply with the case of just a single flow. As an application, we construct an embedded, genus one self-shrinker with entropy lower than a shrinking doughnut.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Cohen-Jones-Segal construction in Morse-Bott theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1995, Cohen, Jones and Segal proposed a method of upgrading any given Floer homology to a stable homotopy-valued invariant. For a generic pseudo-gradient Morse-Bott flow on a closed smooth manifold $M$, we rigorously construct the alleged stable normal framings, which are an essential ingredient in their construction, and give a rigorous proof that the resulting stable homotopy type recovers $\Sigma^\infty_+ M$. We further show that other systems of compatible stable normal framings recover Thom spectra $M^E$, for all reduced $KO$-theory classes $E$ on $M$. Our paper also includes a construction of the smooth corner structure on compactified moduli spaces of broken flow lines with free endpoint, a formal construction of Piunikhin-Salamon-Schwarz type continuation maps, and a way to relax the stable normal framing condition to orientability in orthogonal spectra.</description>
