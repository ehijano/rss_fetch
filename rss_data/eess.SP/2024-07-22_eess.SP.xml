      <title>Optimality of the Bussgang Linear MMSE Channel Estimator for MIMO Systems with 1-Bit ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimality of the Bussgang linear minimum mean squared error (BLMMSE) channel estimator for multiple-input multiple-output systems with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters. We compare the BLMMSE with the optimal minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator, which is generally non-linear, and we develop a novel framework based on the orthant probability of a multivariate normal distribution to compute the MMSE channel estimate. Then, we analyze the equivalence of the MMSE and BLMMSE channel estimators under specific assumptions on the channel correlation or pilot symbols. Interestingly, the BLMMSE channel estimator turns out to be optimal in several specific cases. Our study culminates with the presentation of a necessary and sufficient condition for the BLMMSE channel estimator to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Beam Secure mmWave Wireless Communication for Hybrid Wiretapping Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the physical layer (PHY) security problem for hybrid wiretapping wireless systems in millimeter wave transmission, where active eavesdroppers (AEs) and passive eavesdroppers (PEs) coexist to intercept the confidential messages and emit jamming signals. To achieve secure and reliable transmission, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided robust multi-beam array transceiver scheme. Leveraging beamforming, we aim to minimize transmit power by jointly designing the information and AN beamforming, while satisfying valid reception for legitimate users (LUs), per-antenna power constraints for transmitter, as well as all interception power constraints for eavesdroppers (Eves). In particular, the interception power formulation is taken into account for protecting the information against hybrid Eves with imperfect AE channel state information (CSI) and no PE CSI. In light of the intractability of the problem, we reformulate the considered problem by replacing non-convex constraints with tractable forms. Afterwards, a two-stage algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal solution. Additionally, we design the received beamforming weights by means of minimum variance distortionless response, such that the jamming caused by AEs can be effectively suppressed. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency and security.</description>

      <title>Joint Information and Jamming Beamforming for Securing IoT Networks With Rate-Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to address the physical layer (PHY) security problem for multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) Internet of Things (IoT) systems in the presence of passive eavesdroppers (Eves). To this end, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided rate-splitting (RS)-based secure beamforming scheme. Our design considers the dual use of common messages and places the research emphasis on hiding the private messages for secure communication. In particular, leveraging AN-aided RS-based beamforming, we aim to maximize the focused secrecy sum-rate (F-SSR) by jointly designing transmit information and AN beamforming while satisfying the desired received constraints for the private messages at IoT devices (IoDs), and per-antenna transmit power constraint at base station. Then, we proposed a two-stage algorithm to iteratively find the optimal solution. By transforming non-convex terms into linear terms, we first reformulate the original problem as a convex program. Next, we recast the optimization problem to an unconstrained problem to obtain the global optimal solutions. Utilizing the duality framework, we further develop an efficient algorithm based on a barrier interior point method to solve the reformulated problem. Simulation results validate the superior performance of our proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Track-MDP: Reinforcement Learning for Target Tracking with Controlled Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State of the art methods for target tracking with sensor management (or controlled sensing) are model-based and are obtained through solutions to Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulations. In this paper a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the problem is explored for the setting where the motion model for the object/target to be tracked is unknown to the observer. It is assumed that the target dynamics are stationary in time, the state space and the observation space are discrete, and there is complete observability of the location of the target under certain (a priori unknown) sensor control actions. Then, a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) rather than POMDP formulation is proposed for the tracking problem with controlled sensing, which is termed as Track-MDP. In contrast to the POMDP formulation, the Track-MDP formulation is amenable to an RL based solution. It is shown that the optimal policy for the Track-MDP formulation, which is approximated through RL, is guaranteed to track all significant target paths with certainty. The Track-MDP method is then compared with the optimal POMDP policy, and it is shown that the infinite horizon tracking reward of the optimal Track-MDP policy is the same as that of the optimal POMDP policy. In simulations it is demonstrated that Track-MDP based RL leads to a policy that can track the target with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Mirror Descent-Based Algorithm for Corruption-Tolerant Distributed Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed gradient descent algorithms have come to the fore in modern machine learning, especially in parallelizing the handling of large datasets that are distributed across several workers. However, scant attention has been paid to analyzing the behavior of distributed gradient descent algorithms in the presence of adversarial corruptions instead of random noise. In this paper, we formulate a novel problem in which adversarial corruptions are present in a distributed learning system. We show how to use ideas from (lazy) mirror descent to design a corruption-tolerant distributed optimization algorithm. Extensive convergence analysis for (strongly) convex loss functions is provided for different choices of the stepsize. We carefully optimize the stepsize schedule to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, while at the same time amortizing the effect of the corruption over time. Experiments based on linear regression, support vector classification, and softmax classification on the MNIST dataset corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enabled Semantic Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, achieving near-human levels in multiple language understanding challenges and aligning closely with the core principles of semantic communication. Inspired by LLMs' advancements in semantic processing, we propose an innovative LLM-enabled semantic communication system framework, named LLM-SC, that applies LLMs directly to the physical layer coding and decoding for the first time. By analyzing the relationship between the training process of LLMs and the optimization objectives of semantic communication, we propose training a semantic encoder through LLMs' tokenizer training and establishing a semantic knowledge base via the LLMs' unsupervised pre-training process. This knowledge base aids in constructing the optimal decoder by providing the prior probability of the transmitted language sequence. Based on this foundation, we derive the optimal decoding criterion for the receiver and introduce the beam search algorithm to further reduce the complexity. Furthermore, we assert that existing LLMs can be employed directly for LLM-SC without additional re-training or fine-tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-SC outperforms classical DeepSC at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) exceeding 3 dB, enabling error-free transmission of semantic information under high SNR, which is unattainable by DeepSC. In addition to semantic-level performance, LLM-SC demonstrates compatibility with technical-level performance, achieving approximately 8 dB coding gain for a bit error ratio (BER) of $10^{-3}$ without any channel coding while maintaining the same joint source-channel coding rate as traditional communication systems.</description>

      <title>A Secure and Efficient Distributed Semantic Communication System for Heterogeneous Internet of Things Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications have emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of efficient communication in rapidly evolving and increasingly complex Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, protecting the security of semantic communication systems within the distributed and heterogeneous IoT networks is critical issues that need to be addressed. We develop a secure and efficient distributed semantic communication system in IoT scenarios, focusing on three aspects: secure system maintenance, efficient system update, and privacy-preserving system usage. Firstly, we propose a blockchain-based interaction framework that ensures the integrity, authentication, and availability of interactions among IoT devices to securely maintain system. This framework includes a novel digital signature verification mechanism designed for semantic communications, enabling secure and efficient interactions with semantic communications. Secondly, to improve the efficiency of interactions, we develop a flexible semantic communication scheme that leverages compressed semantic knowledge bases. This scheme reduces the data exchange required for system update and is adapt to dynamic task requirements and the diversity of device capabilities. Thirdly, we exploit the integration of differential privacy into semantic communications. We analyze the implementation of differential privacy taking into account the lossy nature of semantic communications and wireless channel distortions. An joint model-channel noise mechanism is introduced to achieve differential privacy preservation in semantic communications without compromising the system's functionality. Experiments show that the system is able to achieve integrity, availability, efficiency and the preservation of privacy.</description>

      <title>RT-Pose: A 4D Radar Tensor-based 3D Human Pose Estimation and Localization Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for human localization and pose estimation (HPE), which mainly rely on RGB images as an input modality, confront substantial limitations in real-world applications due to privacy concerns. In contrast, radar-based HPE methods emerge as a promising alternative, characterized by distinctive attributes such as through-wall recognition and privacy-preserving, rendering the method more conducive to practical deployments. This paper presents a Radar Tensor-based human pose (RT-Pose) dataset and an open-source benchmarking framework. The RT-Pose dataset comprises 4D radar tensors, LiDAR point clouds, and RGB images, and is collected for a total of 72k frames across 240 sequences with six different complexity-level actions. The 4D radar tensor provides raw spatio-temporal information, differentiating it from other radar point cloud-based datasets. We develop an annotation process using RGB images and LiDAR point clouds to accurately label 3D human skeletons. In addition, we propose HRRadarPose, the first single-stage architecture that extracts the high-resolution representation of 4D radar tensors in 3D space to aid human keypoint estimation. HRRadarPose outperforms previous radar-based HPE work on the RT-Pose benchmark. The overall HRRadarPose performance on the RT-Pose dataset, as reflected in a mean per joint position error (MPJPE) of 9.91cm, indicates the persistent challenges in achieving accurate HPE in complex real-world scenarios. RT-Pose is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/uwipl/RT-Pose.</description>

      <title>PowerTrain: Fast, Generalizable Time and Power Prediction Models to Optimize DNN Training on Accelerated Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accelerated edge devices, like Nvidia's Jetson with 1000+ CUDA cores, are increasingly used for DNN training and federated learning, rather than just for inferencing workloads. A unique feature of these compact devices is their fine-grained control over CPU, GPU, memory frequencies, and active CPU cores, which can limit their power envelope in a constrained setting while throttling the compute performance. Given this vast 10k+ parameter space, selecting a power mode for dynamically arriving training workloads to exploit power-performance trade-offs requires costly profiling for each new workload, or is done \textit{ad hoc}. We propose \textit{PowerTrain}, a transfer-learning approach to accurately predict the power and time consumed when training a given DNN workload (model + dataset) using any specified power mode (CPU/GPU/memory frequencies, core-count). It requires a one-time offline profiling of $1000$s of power modes for a reference DNN workload on a single Jetson device (Orin AGX) to build Neural Network (NN) based prediction models for time and power. These NN models are subsequently transferred (retrained) for a new DNN workload, or even a different Jetson device, with minimal additional profiling of just $50$ power modes to make accurate time and power predictions. These are then used to rapidly construct the Pareto front and select the optimal power mode for the new workload. PowerTrain's predictions are robust to new workloads, exhibiting a low MAPE of $&lt;6\%$ for power and $&lt;15\%$ for time on six new training workloads for up to $4400$ power modes, when transferred from a ResNet reference workload on Orin AGX. It is also resilient when transferred to two entirely new Jetson devices with prediction errors of $&lt;14.5\%$ and $&lt;11\%$. These outperform baseline predictions by more than $10\%$ and baseline optimizations by up to $45\%$ on time and $88\%$ on power.</description>

      <title>Wideband Relative Transfer Function (RTF) Estimation Exploiting Frequency Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on estimating relative transfer functions (RTFs) for beamforming applications. While traditional methods assume that spectra are uncorrelated, this assumption is often violated in practical scenarios due to natural phenomena such as the Doppler effect, artificial manipulations like time-domain windowing, or the non-stationary nature of the signals, as observed in speech. To address this, we propose an RTF estimation technique that leverages spectral and spatial correlations through subspace analysis. To overcome the challenge of estimating second-order spectral statistics for real data, we employ a phase-adjusted estimator originally proposed in the context of engine fault detection. Additionally, we derive Cram\'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for the RTF estimation task, providing theoretical insights into the achievable estimation accuracy. The bounds show that channel estimation can be performed more accurately if the noise or the target presents spectral correlations. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our technique outperforms the narrowband maximum-likelihood estimator when the target exhibits spectral correlations. Although the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is generally close to the bound, there is some room for improvement, especially when noise signals with high spectral correlation are present. While the applications of channel estimation are diverse, we demonstrate the method in the context of array processing for speech.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source and Test-Time Domain Adaptation on Multivariate Signals using Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning applications on signals such as computer vision or biomedical data often face significant challenges due to the variability that exists across hardware devices or session recordings. This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid NOMA-OMA Scheme for Inter-plane Intersatellite Communications in Massive LEO Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication between satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations takes place through inter-satellite links (ISLs). Unlike intra-plane ISLs, which interconnect satellites belonging to the same orbital plane with fixed relative distance, inter-plane ISLs experience significant Doppler frequency shifts, since satellites belonging to different orbital planes exhibit timevarying relative distance (required, e.g., to minimize the risk of physical collisions between satellites). In this paper, we consider the problem of connecting multiple satellites, belonging to a massive LEO constellation, to a receiving satellite, referred to as the sink. Specifically, we consider a hybrid multiple access scheme, which employs a combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where radio-frequency ISLs share the same time-frequency resource blocks, and orthogonal multiple access (OMA), where ISLs employ orthogonal resource blocks. The set of satellites transmitting towards the sink is divided into groups, where NOMA is employed within each group, whereas OMA is used to separate different groups. Such a scheme subsumes as special cases both pure-OMA and pure-NOMA. Our study highlights that similar Doppler frequency shifts have a significant impact on the individual rates of the satellites in a pure-NOMA scheme, thus reducing the network fairness of this technique. Motivated by such a fact, we develop design strategies of the proposed hybrid NOMA-OMA scheme, which exploit inter-plane Doppler frequency diversity to enhance fairness among the satellites, while ensuring a significantly higher sumrate capacity compared to the pure-OMA technique. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical analysis, by demonstrating both the fairness enhancement of the proposed techniques over the pure-NOMA scheme, as well as their capacity improvement over the pure-OMA one.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.</description>

      <title>Data Service Maximization in Space-Air-Ground Integrated 6G Networks</title>

Abstract: Integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks has emerged as a promising paradigm to fulfill the constantly growing demand for connectivity, low transmission delay, and quality of services (QoS). This integration brings together the strengths of the reliability of terrestrial networks, broad coverage and service continuity of non-terrestrial networks like low earth orbit satellites (LEOSats), etc. In this work, we study a data service maximization problem in space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) where the ground base stations (GBSs) and LEOSats cooperatively serve the coexisting aerial users (AUs) and ground users (GUs). Then, by considering the spectrum scarcity, interference, and QoS requirements of the users, we jointly optimize the user association, AU's trajectory, and power allocation. To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, we disintegrate it into two subproblems: 1) user association problem and 2) trajectory and power allocation problem. We formulate the user association problem as a binary integer programming problem and solve it by using the Gurobi optimizer. Meanwhile, the trajectory and power allocation problem is solved by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to cope with the problem's non-convexity and dynamic network environments. Then, the two subproblems are alternately solved by the proposed block coordinate descent algorithm. By comparing with the baselines in the existing literature, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Channel Decoding for Wireless Federated Learning: Convergence Analysis and Adaptive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13703</link>

Abstract: One of the most critical challenges for deploying distributed learning solutions, such as federated learning (FL), in wireless networks is the limited battery capacity of mobile clients. While it is a common belief that the major energy consumption of mobile clients comes from the uplink data transmission, this paper presents a novel finding, namely the channel decoding operation also contributes significantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile clients in FL. Motivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive channel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model errors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy consumption of channel decoders at mobile clients by adaptively adjusting the number of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that wireless FL with communication errors can converge at the same rate as the case with error-free communication as long as the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An adaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy efficiency of wireless FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel decoding energy consumption by 20% when compared to existing approaches.</description>
