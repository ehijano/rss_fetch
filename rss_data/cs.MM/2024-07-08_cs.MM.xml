      <title>Computational Thinking through Design Patterns in Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research has explored potential applications of video games in programming education to elicit computational thinking skills. However, existing approaches are often either too general, not taking into account the diversity of genres and mechanisms between video games, or too narrow, selecting tools that were specifically designed for educational purposes. In this paper we propose a more fundamental approach, defining beneficial connections between individual design patterns present in video games and computational thinking skills. We argue that video games have the capacity to elicit these skills and even to potentially train them. This could be an effective method to solidify a conceptual base which would make programming education more effective.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Video Summarization via Reinforcement Learning and a Trained Evaluator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised video summarization using reinforcement learning. It aims to address the existing limitations of current unsupervised methods, including unstable training of adversarial generator-discriminator architectures and reliance on hand-crafted reward functions for quality evaluation. The proposed method is based on the concept that a concise and informative summary should result in a reconstructed video that closely resembles the original. The summarizer model assigns an importance score to each frame and generates a video summary. In the proposed scheme, reinforcement learning, coupled with a unique reward generation pipeline, is employed to train the summarizer model. The reward generation pipeline trains the summarizer to create summaries that lead to improved reconstructions. It comprises a generator model capable of reconstructing masked frames from a partially masked video, along with a reward mechanism that compares the reconstructed video from the summary against the original. The video generator is trained in a self-supervised manner to reconstruct randomly masked frames, enhancing its ability to generate accurate summaries. This training pipeline results in a summarizer model that better mimics human-generated video summaries compared to methods relying on hand-crafted rewards. The training process consists of two stable and isolated training steps, unlike adversarial architectures. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, with F-scores of 62.3 and 54.5 on TVSum and SumMe datasets, respectively. Additionally, the inference stage is 300 times faster than our previously reported state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>TSC-PCAC: Voxel Transformer and Sparse Convolution Based Point Cloud Attribute Compression for 3D Broadcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud has been the mainstream representation for advanced 3D applications, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. However, the massive data amounts of point clouds is one of the most challenging issues for transmission and storage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end voxel Transformer and Sparse Convolution based Point Cloud Attribute Compression (TSC-PCAC) for 3D broadcasting. Firstly, we present a framework of the TSC-PCAC, which include Transformer and Sparse Convolutional Module (TSCM) based variational autoencoder and channel context module. Secondly, we propose a two-stage TSCM, where the first stage focuses on modeling local dependencies and feature representations of the point clouds, and the second stage captures global features through spatial and channel pooling encompassing larger receptive fields. This module effectively extracts global and local interpoint relevance to reduce informational redundancy. Thirdly, we design a TSCM based channel context module to exploit interchannel correlations, which improves the predicted probability distribution of quantized latent representations and thus reduces the bitrate. Experimental results indicate that the proposed TSC-PCAC method achieves an average of 38.53%, 21.30%, and 11.19% Bjontegaard Delta bitrate reductions compared to the Sparse-PCAC, NF-PCAC, and G-PCC v23 methods, respectively. The encoding/decoding time costs are reduced up to 97.68%/98.78% on average compared to the Sparse-PCAC. The source code and the trained models of the TSC-PCAC are available at https://github.com/igizuxo/TSC-PCAC.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Decision-Making for Multi-User 360 Video Processing over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-task decision-making problem for 360 video processing in a wireless multi-user virtual reality (VR) system that includes an edge computing unit (ECU) to deliver 360 videos to VR users and offer computing assistance for decoding/rendering of video frames. However, this comes at the expense of increased data volume and required bandwidth. To balance this trade-off, we formulate a constrained quality of experience (QoE) maximization problem in which the rebuffering time and quality variation between video frames are bounded by user and video requirements. To solve the formulated multi-user QoE maximization, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-task rate adaptation and computation distribution (MTRC). The proposed MTRC approach does not rely on any predefined assumption about the environment and relies on video playback statistics (i.e., past throughput, decoding time, transmission time, etc.), video information, and the resulting performance to adjust the video bitrate and computation distribution. We train MTRC with real-world wireless network traces and 360 video datasets to obtain evaluation results in terms of the average QoE, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), rebuffering time, and quality variation. Our results indicate that the MTRC improves the users' QoE compared to state-of-the-art rate adaptation algorithm. Specifically, we show a 5.97 dB to 6.44 dB improvement in PSNR, a 1.66X to 4.23X improvement in rebuffering time, and a 4.21 dB to 4.35 dB improvement in quality variation.</description>

      <title>Semantic Grouping Network for Audio Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, audio-visual separation approaches have taken advantage of the natural synchronization between the two modalities to boost audio source separation performance. They extracted high-level semantics from visual inputs as the guidance to help disentangle sound representation for individual sources. Can we directly learn to disentangle the individual semantics from the sound itself? The dilemma is that multiple sound sources are mixed together in the original space. To tackle the difficulty, in this paper, we present a novel Semantic Grouping Network, termed as SGN, that can directly disentangle sound representations and extract high-level semantic information for each source from input audio mixture. Specifically, SGN aggregates category-wise source features through learnable class tokens of sounds. Then, the aggregated semantic features can be used as the guidance to separate the corresponding audio sources from the mixture. We conducted extensive experiments on music-only and universal sound separation benchmarks: MUSIC, FUSS, MUSDB18, and VGG-Sound. The results demonstrate that our SGN significantly outperforms previous audio-only methods and audio-visual models without utilizing additional visual cues.</description>

      <title>Improving Audio Generation with Visual Enhanced Caption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have shown significant achievements in audio generation tasks. However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the low quality and relatively small quantity of training data. In this work, we aim to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions for audio-visual datasets by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). We introduce Sound-VECaps, a dataset comprising 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We demonstrate that training with Sound-VECaps significantly enhances the capability of text-to-audio generation models to comprehend and generate audio from complex input prompts, improving overall system performance. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of Sound-VECaps across several audio-language tasks, suggesting its potential in advancing audio-text representation learning. Our dataset and models are available online.</description>

      <title>VCoME: Verbal Video Composition with Multimodal Editing Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verbal videos, featuring voice-overs or text overlays, provide valuable content but present significant challenges in composition, especially when incorporating editing effects to enhance clarity and visual appeal. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of verbal video composition with editing effects. This task aims to generate coherent and visually appealing verbal videos by integrating multimodal editing effects across textual, visual, and audio categories. To achieve this, we curate a large-scale dataset of video effects compositions from publicly available sources. We then formulate this task as a generative problem, involving the identification of appropriate positions in the verbal content and the recommendation of editing effects for these positions. To address this task, we propose VCoME, a general framework that employs a large multimodal model to generate editing effects for video composition. Specifically, VCoME takes in the multimodal video context and autoregressively outputs where to apply effects within the verbal content and which effects are most appropriate for each position. VCoME also supports prompt-based control of composition density and style, providing substantial flexibility for diverse applications. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of VCoME. A comprehensive user study shows that our method produces videos of professional quality while being 85$\times$ more efficient than professional editors.</description>

      <title>MultiIoT: Benchmarking Machine Learning for the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of machine learning systems must be adept at perceiving and interacting with the physical world through a diverse array of sensory channels. Commonly referred to as the `Internet of Things (IoT)' ecosystem, sensory data from motion, thermal, geolocation, depth, wireless signals, video, and audio are increasingly used to model the states of physical environments and the humans inside them. Despite the potential for understanding human wellbeing, controlling physical devices, and interconnecting smart cities, the community has seen limited benchmarks for building machine learning systems for IoT. Existing efforts are often specialized to a single sensory modality or prediction task, which makes it difficult to study and train large-scale models across many IoT sensors and tasks. To accelerate the development of new machine learning technologies for IoT, this paper proposes MultiIoT, the most expansive and unified IoT benchmark to date, encompassing over 1.15 million samples from 12 modalities and 8 real-world tasks. MultiIoT introduces unique challenges involving (1) generalizable learning from many sensory modalities, (2) multimodal interactions across long temporal ranges, (3) extreme heterogeneity due to unique structure and noise topologies in real-world sensors, and (4) complexity during training and inference. We evaluate a comprehensive set of models on MultiIoT, including modality and task-specific methods, multisensory and multitask supervised models, and large multisensory foundation models. Our results highlight opportunities for ML to make a significant impact in IoT, but many challenges in scalable learning from heterogeneous, long-range, and imperfect sensory modalities still persist. We release all code and data to accelerate future research in machine learning for IoT.</description>

      <title>EasyAnimate: A High-Performance Long Video Generation Method based on Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents EasyAnimate, an advanced method for video generation that leverages the power of transformer architecture for high-performance outcomes. We have expanded the DiT framework originally designed for 2D image synthesis to accommodate the complexities of 3D video generation by incorporating a motion module block. It is used to capture temporal dynamics, thereby ensuring the production of consistent frames and seamless motion transitions. The motion module can be adapted to various DiT baseline methods to generate video with different styles. It can also generate videos with different frame rates and resolutions during both training and inference phases, suitable for both images and videos. Moreover, we introduce slice VAE, a novel approach to condense the temporal axis, facilitating the generation of long duration videos. Currently, EasyAnimate exhibits the proficiency to generate videos with 144 frames. We provide a holistic ecosystem for video production based on DiT, encompassing aspects such as data pre-processing, VAE training, DiT models training (both the baseline model and LoRA model), and end-to-end video inference. Code is available at: https://github.com/aigc-apps/EasyAnimate. We are continuously working to enhance the performance of our method.</description>

      <title>MetaDesigner: Advancing Artistic Typography through AI-Driven, User-Centric, and Multilingual WordArt Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MetaDesigner revolutionizes artistic typography synthesis by leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive a design paradigm centered around user engagement. At the core of this framework lies a multi-agent system comprising the Pipeline, Glyph, and Texture agents, which collectively enable the creation of customized WordArt, ranging from semantic enhancements to the imposition of complex textures. MetaDesigner incorporates a comprehensive feedback mechanism that harnesses insights from multimodal models and user evaluations to refine and enhance the design process iteratively. Through this feedback loop, the system adeptly tunes hyperparameters to align with user-defined stylistic and thematic preferences, generating WordArt that not only meets but exceeds user expectations of visual appeal and contextual relevance. Empirical validations highlight MetaDesigner's capability to effectively serve diverse WordArt applications, consistently producing aesthetically appealing and context-sensitive results.</description>
