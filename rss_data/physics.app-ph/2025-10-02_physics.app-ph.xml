      <title>An infection-responsive collagen-based wet-spun textile fibre for wound monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wound infections are a significant clinical and socioeconomic challenge, contributing to delayed healing and increased wound chronicity. To enable early infection detection and inform therapeutic decisions, this study investigated the design of pH-responsive collagen fibres using a scalable wet spinning process, evaluating product suitability for textile dressings and resorbable sutures. Type I collagen was chemically functionalised with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride, enabling UV-induced crosslinking and yielding mechanically robust fibres. Bromothymol blue, a halochromic dye responsive to pH changes, was incorporated via drop-casting to impart visual infection-responsive colour change. Gravimetric analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy confirmed high dye loading, whereby a Loading Efficiency of 99+/-3 wt.% was achieved. The fibres exhibited controlled swelling in aqueous environments (Swelling Ratio: 323+/-79 - 492+/-73 wt.%) and remarkable wet-state Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS: 12+/-3 - 15+/-7 MPa), while up to ca. 30 wt.% of their initial crosslinked mass was retained after 24 hours in a collagenase-rich buffer (pH 7.4, 37{\deg}C, 2 CDU) and ethanol series dehydration. Importantly, distinct and reversible colour transitions were observed between acidic (pH 5) and alkaline (pH 8) environments, with up to 88 wt.% dye retention following 72-hour incubation. The fibres were successfully processed into woven dressing prototypes and demonstrated knotting ability suitable for suture applications. Overall, these wet-spun collagen fibres integrate infection-responsive capability, biodegradability, and scalable fabrication, representing a promising platform for smart wound dressings and resorbable sutures.</description>

      <title>Comment on the "Electric Power Generation from Earth's Rotation through its Own Magnetic Field"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The suggestion made by C. F. Chyba and K. P. Hand about electric power generation from Earth's rotation through its own magnetic field is intriguing [1, 2]. Here, we reanalyze the theoretical arguments for their conclusion, especially those presented in [1]. The model that they consider, is a magnetic cylindrical shell moving with low velocity $v$ in the $y$ direction at a right angle to the direction of the Earth's magnetic field $B_\infty$. We first focus on one of the electromagnetic boundary conditions for moving dielectric boundaries (a topic not dealt with in [1, 2]), and obtain therefrom a result at variance with the main result in the mentioned papers. Therefore, we have to conclude that their result does not satisfy this boundary condition. Moreover, by a simple calculation, we observe that a displacement of the shell in the mentioned $y$ direction, does not involve any expenditure of external work. A process involving dissipation of energy as envisaged in [1, 2] thus appears to be forbidden for energy conservation reasons.</description>

      <title>Consistent control of drying rates of solution thin films on wafer-sized substrates by dynamic air-knife drying with optimal trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles the problem of achieving consistent drying rates of a solution film deposited on a $20\,\rm{cm}$-wide substrate ($\approx $ silicon-wafer size) that is driven under a narrow air flow ejected by a slot nozzle (or "air knife"). The main prerequisite of the work is that the drying rate of the solution film is highly decisive for a certain performance indicator of the deposited film at a particular, critical concentration $c_{\rm crit.}$. Empirically, this concentration can be associated with the visual observation of "the drying front" as, for the example of hybrid perovskite thin films, caused by the onset of a crystallization process. As a main result, a set of equations for achieving consistent drying rates, $\dot{d}_{\rm crit.}$, at critical concentration is presented that is solved by a simple two-staged least-squares gradient decent. From the resulting velocity vector, an optimal trajectory of the air knife, $\hat{x}(t)$, depending on the initial wet film thickness distribution over the substrate is derived. It is demonstrated that scenarios where the wet film thickness increases along the movement direction of the air knife have a consistent set of equations. Wet thin films that do not obey this constraint, as in the demonstrated scenarios with convex and concave shapes of wet film thickness over the substrate area, cannot always be dried in a fully consistent way by optimizing the air-knife trajectory alone. However, with the presented methods, optimal trajectories can still be derived that enable more homogeneous drying results.</description>

      <title>Determining the Density of In-gap States in Organic Semiconductors: A Pitfall of Photoelectron Yield Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of electronic states with low density in the bandgap (in-gap states) is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. In the device research field, photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) has been widely used to evaluate such states, and its derivative is commonly employed to estimate the density of states (DOS). However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly represent the DOS. Here, we applied hv-dependent high-sensitivity ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy with low-energy photons to probe the origin of photoelectrons in organic semiconductors. We show that PYS signals arise from the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, from SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) in anions, and biphotonic electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusions. Because the BEE signal masks the DOS, derivative PYS can misestimate the DOS of in-gap states. In contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) can reliably determine the DOS. For example, in Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3), we observed BEE, and CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap states and SOMO over six orders of magnitude. The direct determination of the SOMO DOS allowed us to clarify the role of Alq3 in the electron injection layer in organic light-emitting diodes. Moreover, the BEE process can act as both a carrier-generation and degradation pathway in organic optoelectronic devices. These findings demonstrate that CFS-YS provides a reliable method to determine the DOS of in-gap states and to probe exciton and/or anion interactions. We establish practical guidelines for determining the DOS of in-gap states for low-energy photon measurements, such as examining photon-flux dependence.</description>

      <title>Non-linear inhibitory responses enhance performance in collective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis and simulation of lateral memristive devices: Schottky, ohmic, and multi-dimensional electrode models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the numerical analysis and simulations of a multi-dimensional memristive device model. Memristive devices and memtransistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have demonstrated promising potential for neuromorphic computing and next-generation memory technologies. Our charge transport model describes the drift-diffusion of electrons, holes, and ionic defects self-consistently in an electric field. We incorporate two types of boundary models: ohmic and Schottky contacts. The coupled drift-diffusion partial differential equations are discretized using a physics-preserving Voronoi finite volume method. It relies on an implicit time-stepping scheme and the excess chemical potential flux approximation. We demonstrate that the fully discrete nonlinear scheme is unconditionally stable, preserving the free-energy structure of the continuous system and ensuring the non-negativity of carrier densities. Novel discrete entropy-dissipation inequalities for both boundary condition types in multiple dimensions allow us to prove the existence of discrete solutions. We perform multi-dimensional simulations to understand the impact of electrode configurations and device geometries, focusing on the hysteresis behavior in lateral 2D memristive devices. Three electrode configurations -- side, top, and mixed contacts -- are compared numerically for different geometries and boundary conditions. These simulations reveal the conditions under which a simplified one-dimensional electrode geometry can well represent the three electrode configurations. This work lays the foundations for developing accurate, efficient simulation tools for 2D memristive devices and memtransistors, offering tools and guidelines for their design and optimization in future applications.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Impacted Beam Statistics and Image Topology with Lorentz Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous statistical and geometric framework for analyzing turbulence-impacted beam propagation and image topology with results obtained using a PMMA slab. The approach models beam intensity distributions as n-dimensional data set represented through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), embedding them into the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By employing information geometric tools, geodesic distances, and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics, we establish a principled methodology for quantifying similarity and dissimilarity among beam images. Experimental results demonstrate topological distance trends, distance statistics, and correlation measures for different turbulence scenarios, including polarized and unpolarized cases. Histograms of distance statistics reveal stable statistical features, with correlation coefficients highlighting the turbulence-induced variability in PMMA-based beam propagation. The framework not only provides a systematic foundation for analyzing optical beam statistics under turbulence but also opens avenues for advanced applications such as deep learning-based feature reduction, image compression, and secure free-space optical (FSO) communication. Future directions include refining the GMM-EM based distance measures, comparative scatter analysis, and developing robust statistical tools for turbulence imaging. Overall, this study bridges theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and potential technological applications in adaptive and applied optics.</description>
