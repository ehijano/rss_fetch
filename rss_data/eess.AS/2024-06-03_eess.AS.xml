      <title>Cross-Talk Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While far-field multi-talker mixtures are recorded, each speaker can wear a close-talk microphone so that close-talk mixtures can be recorded at the same time. Although each close-talk mixture has a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the wearer, it has a very limited range of applications, as it also contains significant cross-talk speech by other speakers and is not clean enough. In this context, we propose a novel task named cross-talk reduction (CTR) which aims at reducing cross-talk speech, and a novel solution named CTRnet which is based on unsupervised or weakly-supervised neural speech separation. In unsupervised CTRnet, close-talk and far-field mixtures are stacked as input for a DNN to estimate the close-talk speech of each speaker. It is trained in an unsupervised, discriminative way such that the DNN estimate for each speaker can be linearly filtered to cancel out the speaker's cross-talk speech captured at other microphones. In weakly-supervised CTRnet, we assume the availability of each speaker's activity timestamps during training, and leverage them to improve the training of unsupervised CTRnet. Evaluation results on a simulated two-speaker CTR task and on a real-recorded conversational speech separation and recognition task show the effectiveness and potential of CTRnet.</description>

      <title>Very Low Complexity Speech Synthesis Using Framewise Autoregressive GAN (FARGAN) with Pitch Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural vocoders are now being used in a wide range of speech processing applications. In many of those applications, the vocoder can be the most complex component, so finding lower complexity algorithms can lead to significant practical benefits. In this work, we propose FARGAN, an autoregressive vocoder that takes advantage of long-term pitch prediction to synthesize high-quality speech in small subframes, without the need for teacher-forcing. Experimental results show that the proposed 600~MFLOPS FARGAN vocoder can achieve both higher quality and lower complexity than existing low-complexity vocoders. The quality even matches that of existing higher-complexity vocoders.</description>

      <title>SeamlessExpressiveLM: Speech Language Model for Expressive Speech-to-Speech Translation with Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is a key research topic in seamless communication, which focuses on the preservation of semantics and speaker vocal style in translated speech. Early works synthesized speaker style aligned speech in order to directly learn the mapping from speech to target speech spectrogram. Without reliance on style aligned data, recent studies leverage the advances of language modeling (LM) and build cascaded LMs on semantic and acoustic tokens. This work proposes SeamlessExpressiveLM, a single speech language model for expressive S2ST. We decompose the complex source-to-target speech mapping into intermediate generation steps with chain-of-thought prompting. The model is first guided to translate target semantic content and then transfer the speaker style to multi-stream acoustic units. Evaluated on Spanish-to-English and Hungarian-to-English translations, SeamlessExpressiveLM outperforms cascaded LMs in both semantic quality and style transfer, meanwhile achieving better parameter efficiency.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dataset Sampling Rate for Noise Cancellation through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Active noise cancellation has been a subject of research for decades. Traditional techniques, like the Fast Fourier Transform, have limitations in certain scenarios. This research explores the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) as a superior alternative. Objective: The study aims to determine the effect sampling rate within training data has on lightweight, efficient DNNs that operate within the processing constraints of mobile devices. Methods: We chose the ConvTasNET network for its proven efficiency in speech separation and enhancement. ConvTasNET was trained on datasets such as WHAM!, LibriMix, and the MS-2023 DNS Challenge. The datasets were sampled at rates of 8kHz, 16kHz, and 48kHz to analyze the effect of sampling rate on noise cancellation efficiency and effectiveness. The model was tested on a core-i7 Intel processor from 2023, assessing the network's ability to produce clear audio while filtering out background noise. Results: Models trained at higher sampling rates (48kHz) provided much better evaluation metrics against Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Quality Prediction For Generative Neural Speech Codecs (WARP-Q) values, indicating improved audio quality. However, a trade-off was noted with the processing time being longer for higher sampling rates. Conclusions: The Conv-TasNET network, trained on datasets sampled at higher rates like 48kHz, offers a robust solution for mobile devices in achieving noise cancellation through speech separation and enhancement. Future work involves optimizing the model's efficiency further and testing on mobile devices.</description>

      <title>On the Condition Monitoring of Bolted Joints through Acoustic Emission and Deep Transfer Learning: Generalization, Ordinal Loss and Super-Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of deep transfer learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to monitor the condition of bolted joints using acoustic emissions. Bolted structures are critical components in many mechanical systems, and the ability to monitor their condition status is crucial for effective structural health monitoring. We evaluated the performance of our methodology using the ORION-AE benchmark, a structure composed of two thin beams connected by three bolts, where highly noisy acoustic emission measurements were taken to detect changes in the applied tightening torque of the bolts. The data used from this structure is derived from the transformation of acoustic emission data streams into images using continuous wavelet transform, and leveraging pretrained CNNs for feature extraction and denoising. Our experiments compared single-sensor versus multiple-sensor fusion for estimating the tightening level (loosening) of bolts and evaluated the use of raw versus prefiltered data on the performance. We particularly focused on the generalization capabilities of CNN-based transfer learning across different measurement campaigns and we studied ordinal loss functions to penalize incorrect predictions less severely when close to the ground truth, thereby encouraging misclassification errors to be in adjacent classes. Network configurations as well as learning rate schedulers are also investigated, and super-convergence is obtained, i.e., high classification accuracy is achieved in a few number of iterations with different networks. Furthermore, results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of CNN-based transfer learning for monitoring bolted structures by acoustic emission with varying amounts of prior information required during training.</description>

      <title>StreamVoice: Streamable Context-Aware Language Modeling for Real-time Zero-Shot Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent language model (LM) advancements have showcased impressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) performance. However, existing LM-based VC models usually apply offline conversion from source semantics to acoustic features, demanding the complete source speech and limiting their deployment to real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce StreamVoice, a novel streaming LM-based model for zero-shot VC, facilitating real-time conversion given arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. Specifically, to enable streaming capability, StreamVoice employs a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor, while alternately processing semantic and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression which eliminates the dependence on complete source speech. To address the potential performance degradation from the incomplete context in streaming processing, we enhance the context-awareness of the LM through two strategies: 1) teacher-guided context foresight, using a teacher model to summarize the present and future semantic context during training to guide the model's forecasting for missing context; 2) semantic masking strategy, promoting acoustic prediction from preceding corrupted semantic and acoustic input, enhancing context-learning ability. Notably, StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead. Experiments demonstrate StreamVoice's streaming conversion capability while achieving zero-shot performance comparable to non-streaming VC systems.</description>

      <title>Spoken Question Answering and Speech Continuation Using Spectrogram-Powered LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Spectron, a novel approach to adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to perform spoken question answering (QA) and speech continuation. By endowing the LLM with a pre-trained speech encoder, our model becomes able to take speech inputs and generate speech outputs. The entire system is trained end-to-end and operates directly on spectrograms, simplifying our architecture. Key to our approach is a training objective that jointly supervises speech recognition, text continuation, and speech synthesis using only paired speech-text pairs, enabling a `cross-modal' chain-of-thought within a single decoding pass. Our method surpasses existing spoken language models in speaker preservation and semantic coherence. Furthermore, the proposed model improves upon direct initialization in retaining the knowledge of the original LLM as demonstrated through spoken QA datasets. We release our audio samples (https://michelleramanovich.github.io/spectron/spectron) and spoken QA dataset (https://github.com/google-research-datasets/LLAMA1-Test-Set).</description>

      <title>Female mosquito detection by means of AI techniques inside release containers in the context of a Sterile Insect Technique program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a biological pest control technique based on the release into the environment of sterile males of the insect species whose population is to be controlled. The entire SIT process involves mass-rearing within a biofactory, sorting of the specimens by sex, sterilization, and subsequent release of the sterile males into the environment. The reason for avoiding the release of female specimens is because, unlike males, females bite, with the subsequent risk of disease transmission. In the case of Aedes mosquito biofactories for SIT, the key point of the whole process is sex separation. This process is nowadays performed by a combination of mechanical devices and AI-based vision systems. However, there is still a possibility of false negatives, so a last stage of verification is necessary before releasing them into the environment. It is known that the sound produced by the flapping of adult male mosquitoes is different from that produced by females, so this feature can be used to detect the presence of females in containers prior to environmental release. This paper presents a study for the detection of females in Aedes mosquito release vessels for SIT programs. The containers used consist of PVC a tubular design of 8.8cm diameter and 12.5cm height. The containers were placed in an experimental setup that allowed the recording of the sound of mosquito flight inside of them. Each container was filled with 250 specimens considering the cases of (i) only male mosquitoes, (ii) only female mosquitoes, and (iii) 75% males and 25% females. Case (i) was used for training and testing, whereas cases (ii) and (iii) were used only for testing. Two algorithms were implemented for the detection of female mosquitoes: an unsupervised outlier detection algorithm (iForest) and a one-class SVM trained with male-only recordings.</description>

      <title>ELF: Encoding Speaker-Specific Latent Speech Feature for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling numerous speakers, which enables expressing the overall characteristics of speakers in detail like a trained multi-speaker model without additional training on the target speaker's dataset. Although various works with similar purposes have been actively studied, their performance has not yet reached that of trained multi-speaker models due to their fundamental limitations. To overcome previous limitations, we propose effective methods for feature learning and representing target speakers' speech characteristics by discretizing the features and conditioning them to a speech synthesis model. Our method obtained a significantly higher similarity mean opinion score (SMOS) in subjective similarity evaluation than seen speakers of a high-performance multi-speaker model, even with unseen speakers. The proposed method also outperforms a zero-shot method by significant margins. Furthermore, our method shows remarkable performance in generating new artificial speakers. In addition, we demonstrate that the encoded latent features are sufficiently informative to reconstruct an original speaker's speech completely. It implies that our method can be used as a general methodology to encode and reconstruct speakers' characteristics in various tasks.</description>

      <title>Any2Point: Empowering Any-modality Large Models for Efficient 3D Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large foundation models have recently emerged as a prominent focus of interest, attaining superior performance in widespread scenarios. Due to the scarcity of 3D data, many efforts have been made to adapt pre-trained transformers from vision to 3D domains. However, such 2D-to-3D approaches are still limited, due to the potential loss of spatial geometries and high computation cost. More importantly, their frameworks are mainly designed for 2D models, lacking a general any-to-3D paradigm. In this paper, we introduce Any2Point, a parameter-efficient method to empower any-modality large models (vision, language, audio) for 3D understanding. Given a frozen transformer from any source modality, we propose a 3D-to-any (1D or 2D) virtual projection strategy that correlates the input 3D points to the original 1D or 2D positions within the source modality. This mechanism enables us to assign each 3D token with a positional encoding paired with the pre-trained model, which avoids 3D geometry loss caused by the true projection and better motivates the transformer for 3D learning with 1D/2D positional priors. Then, within each transformer block, we insert an any-to-3D guided adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The adapter incorporates prior spatial knowledge from the source modality to guide the local feature aggregation of 3D tokens, compelling the semantic adaption of any-modality transformers. We conduct extensive experiments to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code and models are released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/Any2Point.</description>

      <title>SpeechVerse: A Large-scale Generalizable Audio Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible proficiency in performing tasks that require semantic understanding of natural language instructions. Recently, many works have further expanded this capability to perceive multimodal audio and text inputs, but their capabilities are often limited to specific fine-tuned tasks such as automatic speech recognition and translation. We therefore develop SpeechVerse, a robust multi-task training and curriculum learning framework that combines pre-trained speech and text foundation models via a small set of learnable parameters, while keeping the pre-trained models frozen during training. The models are instruction finetuned using continuous latent representations extracted from the speech foundation model to achieve optimal zero-shot performance on a diverse range of speech processing tasks using natural language instructions. We perform extensive benchmarking that includes comparing our model performance against traditional baselines across several datasets and tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the model's capability for generalized instruction following by testing on out-of-domain datasets, novel prompts, and unseen tasks. Our empirical experiments reveal that our multi-task SpeechVerse model is even superior to conventional task-specific baselines on 9 out of the 11 tasks.</description>

      <title>Spiketrum: An FPGA-based Implementation of a Neuromorphic Cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea's ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description>

      <title>Zipper: A Multi-Tower Decoder Architecture for Fusing Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating multiple generative foundation models, especially those trained on different modalities, into something greater than the sum of its parts poses significant challenges. Two key hurdles are the availability of aligned data (concepts that contain similar meaning but is expressed differently in different modalities), and effectively leveraging unimodal representations in cross-domain generative tasks, without compromising their original unimodal capabilities.
  We propose Zipper, a multi-tower decoder architecture that addresses these concerns by using cross-attention to flexibly compose multimodal generative models from independently pre-trained unimodal decoders. In our experiments fusing speech and text modalities, we show the proposed architecture performs very competitively in scenarios with limited aligned text-speech data. We also showcase the flexibility of our model to selectively maintain unimodal (e.g., text-to-text generation) generation performance by freezing the corresponding modal tower (e.g. text). In cross-modal tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) where the output modality is text, we show that freezing the text backbone results in negligible performance degradation. In cross-modal tasks such as text-to-speech generation (TTS) where the output modality is speech, we show that using a pre-trained speech backbone results in superior performance to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Iterative Feature Boosting for Explainable Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In speech emotion recognition (SER), using predefined features without considering their practical importance may lead to high dimensional datasets, including redundant and irrelevant information. Consequently, high-dimensional learning often results in decreasing model accuracy while increasing computational complexity. Our work underlines the importance of carefully considering and analyzing features in order to build efficient SER systems. We present a new supervised SER method based on an efficient feature engineering approach. We pay particular attention to the explainability of results to evaluate feature relevance and refine feature sets. This is performed iteratively through feature evaluation loop, using Shapley values to boost feature selection and improve overall framework performance. Our approach allows thus to balance the benefits between model performance and transparency. The proposed method outperforms human-level performance (HLP) and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in emotion recognition on the TESS dataset.</description>
