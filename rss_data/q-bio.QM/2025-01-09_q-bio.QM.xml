      <title>A Framework for Building Enviromics Matrices in Mixed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a framework for constructing enviromics matrices in mixed models to integrate genetic and environmental data to enhance phenotypic predictions in plant breeding. Enviromics utilizes diverse data sources, such as climate and soil, to characterize genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions. The approach employs block-diagonal structures in the design matrix to incorporate random effects from genetic and envirotypic covariates across trials. The covariance structure is modeled using the Kronecker product of the genetic relationship matrix and an identity matrix representing envirotypic effects, capturing genetic and environmental variability. This dual representation enables more accurate crop performance predictions across environments, improving selection strategies in breeding programs. The framework is compatible with existing mixed model software, including rrBLUP and BGLR, and can be extended for more complex interactions. By combining genetic relationships and environmental influences, this approach offers a powerful tool for advancing GxE studies and accelerating the development of improved crop varieties.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and statistical classification of CRISPR-Cas12a diagnostic assays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CRISPR-based diagnostics have gained increasing attention as biosensing tools able to address limitations in contemporary molecular diagnostic tests. To maximise the performance of CRISPR-based assays, much effort has focused on optimizing the chemistry and biology of the biosensing reaction. However, less attention has been paid to improving the techniques used to analyse CRISPR-based diagnostic data. To date, diagnostic decisions typically involve various forms of slope-based classification. Such methods are superior to traditional methods based on assessing absolute signals, but still have limitations. Herein, we establish performance benchmarks (total accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) using common slope-based methods. We compare the performance of these benchmark methods with three different quadratic empirical distribution function statistical tests, finding significant improvements in diagnostic speed and accuracy when applied to a clinical data set. Two of the three statistical techniques, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests, report the lowest time-to-result and highest total test accuracy. Furthermore, we developed a long short-term memory recurrent neural network to classify CRISPR-biosensing data, achieving 100% specificity on our model data set. Finally, we provide guidelines on choosing the classification method and classification method parameters that best suit a diagnostic assays needs.</description>

      <title>Fast Directed $q$-Analysis for Brain Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent innovations in reconstructing large scale, full-precision, neuron-synapse-scale connectomes demand subsequent improvements to graph analysis methods to keep up with the growing complexity and size of the data. One such tool is the recently introduced directed $q$-analysis. We present numerous improvements, theoretical and applied, to this technique: on the theoretical side, we introduce modified definitions for key elements of directed $q$-analysis, which remedy a well-hidden and previously undetected bias. This also leads to new, beneficial perspectives to the associated computational challenges. Most importantly, we present a high-speed, publicly available, low-level implementation that provides speed-ups of several orders of magnitude on C. Elegans. Furthermore, the speed gains grow with the size of the considered graph. This is made possible due to the mathematical and algorithmic improvements as well as a carefully crafted implementation. These speed-ups enable, for the first time, the analysis of full-sized connectomes such as those obtained by recent reconstructive methods. Additionally, the speed-ups allow comparative analysis to corresponding null models, appropriately designed randomly structured artificial graphs that do not correspond to actual brains. This, in turn, allows for assessing the efficacy and usefulness of directed $q$-analysis for studying the brain. We report on the results in this paper.</description>

      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptides prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model, employing an Extra-Trees classifier, has been validated on the AntiCP 2.0 and mACPpred 2.0 benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance or results comparable to existing deep learning models, while providing greater interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>
