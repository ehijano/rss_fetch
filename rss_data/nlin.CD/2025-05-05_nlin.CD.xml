      <title>Controlling the effect of quantum fluctuations in a driven nonlinear parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between a high-frequency external forcing and the intrinsic dynamics of a quantum nonlinear parametric oscillator. To analyze this system, classical equations of motion of the averages of quantum operators are derived and solved by employing suitable truncation schemes and the Blekhman perturbation method. It is observed that quantum fluctuations and oscillation amplitudes within the parametric resonance zone can be modulated through the fast external periodic forcing. Moreover, the influence of the strength of driving on the overall system dynamics is systematically explored. Finally, the theoretical predictions are validated through numerical simulations, establishing the reliability of the developed framework.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of chaos in billiards: the role of mixed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system plays a crucial role in shaping its dynamics, which may be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. When a boundary has varying curvature, it offers a unique setting to study the relation between classical chaos and quantum behaviour. In this study, we introduce two geometrically distinct billiards: a bean-shaped boundary and a peanut-shaped variant of Cassini ovals. These systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing walls with no neutral segments. Our study reveals a strong correlation between classical and quantum dynamics. Our analysis of billiard flow diagrams confirms sensitivity to initial conditions(ICs)- a defining feature of chaos. Poincar\'e maps further show the phase space intricately woven with regions of chaotic motion and stability islands. Moving to the quantum domain, we employ nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and level spacing ratio as statistical measures to characterise chaos. Early time saturation in spectral complexity also supports an ergodic hierarchy in these systems. We observe a striking quantum phenomenon, i.e. eigenfunction scarring. This work bridges geometric boundary effects, classical hyperbolicity, and quantum ergodicity, offering a framework to engineer chaos in confined systems.</description>
