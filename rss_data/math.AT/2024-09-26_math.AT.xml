      <title>Type 2 complexes constructed from Brown-Gitler spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, one of us interpreted mod 2 Dyer-Lashof operations as explicit A-module extensions between Brown-Gitler modules, and showed these A-modules can be topologically realized by finite spectra occurring as fibers of maps between 2-local dual Brown-Gitler spectra.
  Starting from these constructions, in this paper, we show that infinite families of these finite spectra are of chromatic type 2, with mod 2 cohomology that is free over A(1). Applications include classifying the dual Brown-Gitler spectra after localization with respect to K-theory.</description>

      <title>Fundamental polytope for the Weyl group acting on a maximal torus of a compact Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a fundamental domain for the action of the finite Weyl group on a maximal torus of a compact Lie group of the corresponding type. The general situation is reduced to the adjoint case and, from the perspective of root data, this problem can be rephrased by asking for a fundamental polytope for the action of the extended affine Weyl group on the (dual) toral subalgebra. We solve the problem in this second form.
  Using the theory of minuscule weights, we obtain a description of this fundamental polytope as a convex hull of explicit vertices, and as an intersection of closed half-spaces. The latter description was first obtained by Komrakov and Premet in 1984 but, as the present work is independent of that of Komrakov-Premet, we give a new self-contained proof of it. We also derive some consequences on the structure of automorphism groups of extended Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>The geometric diagonal of the special linear algebraic cobordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivic version of the $c_1$-spherical cobordism spectrum is constructed. A connection of this spectrum with other motivic Thom spectra is established. Using this connection, we compute the $\mathbb{P}^1$-diagonal of the homotopy groups of the special linear algebraic cobordism $\pi_{2*,*}(\mathrm{MSL})$ over a local Dedekind domain $k$ with $1/2\in k$ after inverting the exponential characteristic of the residue field of $k$. We discuss the action of the motivic Hopf element $\eta$ on this ring, obtain a description of the localization away from $2$ and compute the $2$-primary torsion subgroup. The complete answer is given in terms of the special unitary cobordism ring. An important component of the computation is the construction of Pontryagin characteristic numbers with values in the Hermitian K-theory. We also construct Chern numbers in this setting, prove the motivic version of the Anderson-Brown-Peterson theorem and briefly discuss classes of Calabi-Yau varieties in the $\mathrm{SL}$-cobordism ring.</description>

      <title>Squares K-theory and 2-Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an $S_\bullet$-construction for squares categories, and introduce a class of squares categories we call "proto-Waldhausen" which capture the properties required for the $S_\bullet$-construction to model the K-theory space. The primary question we investigate is when the $S_\bullet$-construction of a squares category produces a 2-Segal space. We show that the answer to this question is affirmative when the squares category satisfies certain "stability" conditions. In an appendix, we discuss a version of Waldhausen's additivity theorem for squares K-theory.</description>

      <title>Complex K-theory of 4-complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note summarizes a number of facts about the ring $K^0(X)$ for $X$ a $4$-dimensional CW-complex. Unusual features of this dimension are that every complex vector bundle is determined up to stable isomorphism by its Chern classes, that every even cohomology class arises as a Chern class of a vector bundle, and that $K^0(X)$ is completely determined as a ring by knowledge of the even-dimensional cohomology ring $H^{\text{even}}(X; \mathbb Z)$. (All of these fail in high dimensions.)</description>

      <title>Admissible Skein Modules and Ansular Functors: A Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite ribbon category, which is a particular case of a cyclic algebra over the operad of genus zero surfaces, there are two possibilities for an extension defined on all three-dimensional handlebodies: On the one hand, one can use the admissible skein module construction of Costantino-Geer-Patureau-Mirand. On other hand, by a construction of the authors using Costello's modular envelope, one can build a so-called ansular functor, a handlebody version of the notion of a modular functor. Unlike the admissible skein modules with their construction through the Reshetikhin-Turaev graphical calculus, the ansular functor is defined purely through a universal property. In this note, we prove the widely held expectation that these constructions are related by giving an isomorphism between them, with the somewhat surprising subtlety that we need to include consistently on one of the sides an additional boundary component labeled by the distinguished invertible object of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik. In other words, the constructions agree on handlebodies up to a `background charge' that becomes trivial in the unimodular case. Our comparison result includes the handlebody group action as well as the skein algebra action.</description>

      <title>A Cubical Perspective on Complements of Union-Closed Families of Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complements of union-closed families of sets, over a finite ground set, are known as simply rooted families of sets. Cubical sets are widely studied topological objects having applications in computational homology. In this paper, we look at simply rooted families of sets from the perspective of cubical sets. That is, for every family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of a finite set, we construct a natural cubical set $X(\mathcal F)$ (corresponding to it). We show that for every simply rooted family $\mathcal F$, containing the empty set, the cubical set $X(\mathcal F)$ is always acyclic (that is, it has trivial reduced cubical homology). As a consequence of this, using the Euler-Poincar\`{e} formula, we obtain a formula satisfied by all simply rooted families of sets which contain the empty set. We also provide an elementary proof of this formula.</description>

      <title>Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology in the context of curved algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology of an algebra with coefficients in a module is defined by deriving a functor based on K\"ahler differential forms. It can be computed using a cofibrant resolution of the algebra in a model category structure where weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms. This construction works for algebras over an operad, providing a cohomology theory tailored for each type of algebra. For curved algebras however, the notion of quasi-isomorphism is meaningless. The occurrence and importance of curved structures in various research topics (symplectic topology, deformation theory, derived geometry, mathematical physics) motivate the development of their homotopy theory and Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology theory. To get a homotopical context with an appropriate notion of weak equivalence, we consider filtered complete modules with a predifferential inducing a differential on the associated graded. Curved algebras in such modules are algebras over a curved operad. In this article, we consider curved operads which are not necessarily augmented. Bar and cobar constructions adapted to these curved operads are developed, as well as Koszul duality theory. Consequently, we obtain homotopy versions of our curved algebras and make it explicit for interesting cases. Two main examples are the curved operads encoding curved unital associative algebras and curved complex Lie algebras. In particular, homotopy curved unital associative algebras describe the structure of Floer complexes of lagrangian submanifolds and Fukaya categories in symplectic topology. Bar and cobar constructions for curved algebras are also developed, and we obtain resolutions from which we compute their Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology with module coefficients. Our computations in the case of curved complex Lie algebras reveal an interesting link between their Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology and derived complex analytic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Hopf invariants, defined by evaluation in Harrison cohomology of the commutative cochains of a space, calculate the logarithm map from a fundamental group to its Malcev Lie algebra. They thus present the zeroth Harrison cohomology as a universal dual object to the Malcev Lie algebra. This structural theorem supports explicit calculations in algebraic topology, geometric topology and combinatorial group theory. In particular, we give the first algorithm to determine whether a power of a word is a k-fold nested commutator while encoding commutator structure in any group presented by generators and relations.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of minimal Sullivan algebras of non-finite type and their realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the morphisms from a minimal Sullivan algebra $\Lambda V$ to $A_{PL}(|\Lambda V|)$, the algebra of polynomial differential forms on its realization, can be quasi-isomorphic if and only if the cohomology $H(\Lambda V)$ is of finite type. Importantly, $\Lambda V$ itself need not be of finite type. For example, it can be the minimal Sullivan model of the wedge sum of a circle and a sphere. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by F\'elix, Halperin, and Thomas. Furthermore, we study the spaces whose homotopy groups are reflected by their minimal Sullivan models as a generalization of Sullivan spaces, and explore which properties of Sullivan spaces can be broadened.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce persistence matching diagrams induced by set mappings of metric spaces, based on 0-persistent homology of Vietoris-Rips filtrations. Also, we present a geometric definition of the persistence matching diagram that is more intuitive than the algebraic one. In addition, we show that such matching diagrams encapsulate the information of persistence morphism images, kernels and cokernels induced by embeddings. The main result is a stability theorem for persistence matching diagrams induced by embeddings. At the end, we adapt our stability result for set injections (not embeddings) of finite metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Capturing Tie Strength with Algebraic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The association between tie strength and social structure is a fundamental topic in the social sciences. We study this association by analyzing tie strength in higher-order networks, an increasingly relevant model which can encode group interactions between three or more individuals. First, we introduce three measures based on algebraic topology which characterize the network context and influence of an edge. Our experimental results across 15 datasets indicate that these measures outperform standard network proxies in estimating tie strength. We further find that these measures can replicate and explain a puzzle wherein certain bridging ties are surprisingly strong. We then consider a single centrality measure which combines the three initial measures, is highly inversely related to tie strength, and can be interpreted through an information exchange process which highlights ties that have access to useful information. In this sense, we are able to illuminate the information advantages of weak ties due to their network position.</description>
