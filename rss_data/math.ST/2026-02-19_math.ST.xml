      <title>Ratio Covers of Convex Sets and Optimal Mixture Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study density estimation in Kullback-Leibler divergence: given an i.i.d. sample from an unknown density $p$, the goal is to construct an estimator $\widehat p$ such that $\mathrm{KL}(p,\widehat p)$ is small with high probability. We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions.
  Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions. Second, we prove an optimal ratio covering theorem for convex sets: for every convex compact set $K\subset \mathbb{R}_+^d$, there exists a subset $A\subset K$ with at most $2^{8d}$ elements such that each element of $K$ is coordinate-wise dominated by an element of $A$ up to a universal constant factor. This geometric result is of independent interest; notably, it yields new cardinality estimates for $\varepsilon$-approximate Pareto sets in multi-objective optimization when the attainable set of objective vectors is convex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric estimation of the linear multiplier function $\theta(t)$ for processes satisfying stochastic differential equations of the type $$dX_t=\theta(t) X_tdt+ \epsilon dZ^{q,H}_t, X_0=x_0, 0\leq t \leq T$$ where $\{Z^{q,H}_t, t \geq 0\}$ is a Hermite process with known order $q$ and known self-similarity parameter $H \in (\frac{1}{2},1).$ We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the estimator of the unknown function $\theta(t)$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0.$</description>

      <title>HAL-MLE Log-Splines Density Estimation (Part I: Univariate)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of probability densities under a total variation (TV) type penalty, sectional variation norm (also named as Hardy-Krause variation). TV regularization has a long history in regression and density estimation, including results on $L^2$ and KL divergence convergence rates. Here, we revisit this task using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) framework. We formulate a HAL-based maximum likelihood estimator (HAL-MLE) using the log-spline link function from \citet{kooperberg1992logspline}, and show that in the univariate setting the bounded sectional variation norm assumption underlying HAL coincides with the classical bounded TV assumption. This equivalence directly connects HAL-MLE to existing TV-penalized approaches such as local adaptive splines \citep{mammen1997locally}. We establish three new theoretical results: (i) the univariate HAL-MLE is asymptotically linear, (ii) it admits pointwise asymptotic normality, and (iii) it achieves uniform convergence at rate $n^{-(k+1)/(2k+3)}$ up to logarithmic factors for the smoothness order $k \geq 1$. These results extend existing results from \citet{van2017uniform}, which previously guaranteed only uniform consistency without rates when $k=0$. We will include the uniform convergence for general dimension $d$ in the follow-up work of this paper. The intention of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the TV-penalized density estimation methods, and to connect the HAL-MLE to the existing TV-penalized methods in the univariate case, despite that the general HAL-MLE is defined for multivariate cases.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal parametrisations of Extreme-Value distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme value distributions are routinely employed to assess risks connected to extreme events in a large number of applications. They typically are two- or three- parameter distributions: the inference can be unstable, which is particularly problematic given the fact that often times these distributions are fitted to small samples. Furthermore, the distribution's parameters are generally not directly interpretable and not the key aim of the estimation. We present several orthogonal reparametrisations of the main extreme-value distributions, key in the modelling of rare events. In particular, we apply the theory developed in Cox and Reid (1987) to the Generalised Extreme-Value, Generalised Pareto, and Gumbel distributions. We illustrate the principal advantage of these reparametrisations in a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Conformal Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deformations of the geodesic distances on a domain of R N induced by a function called conformal factor. We show that under a positive reach assumption on the domain (not necessarily a submanifold) and mild assumptions on the conformal factor, geodesics for the conformal metric have good regularity properties in the form of a lower bounded reach. This regularity allows for efficient estimation of the conformal metric from a random point cloud with a relative error proportional to the Hausdorff distance between the point cloud and the original domain. We then establish convergence rates of order n^(-1/d) that are close to sharp when the intrinsic dimension d of the domain is large, for an estimator that can be computed in O(n^2 ) time. Finally, this paper includes a useful equivalence result between ball graphs and nearest-neighbors graphs when assuming Ahlfors regularity of the sampling measure, allowing to transpose results from one setting to another.</description>

      <title>Optimal training-conditional regret for online conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online conformal prediction for non-stationary data streams subject to unknown distribution drift. While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift.
  When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Separating Oblivious and Adaptive Models of Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse recovery is among the most well-studied problems in learning theory and high-dimensional statistics. In this work, we investigate the statistical and computational landscapes of sparse recovery with $\ell_\infty$ error guarantees. This variant of the problem is motivated by \emph{variable selection} tasks, where the goal is to estimate the support of a $k$-sparse signal in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main contribution is a provable separation between the \emph{oblivious} (``for each'') and \emph{adaptive} (``for all'') models of $\ell_\infty$ sparse recovery. We show that under an oblivious model, the optimal $\ell_\infty$ error is attainable in near-linear time with $\approx k\log d$ samples, whereas in an adaptive model, $\gtrsim k^2$ samples are necessary for any algorithm to achieve this bound. This establishes a surprising contrast with the standard $\ell_2$ setting, where $\approx k \log d$ samples suffice even for adaptive sparse recovery. We conclude with a preliminary examination of a \emph{partially-adaptive} model, where we show nontrivial variable selection guarantees are possible with $\approx k\log d$ measurements.</description>

      <title>On Sharpened Convergence Rate of Generalized Sliced Inverse Regression for Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Sliced Inverse Regression (GSIR) is one of the most important methods for nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction. As shown in Li and Song (2017), it enjoys a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension of the predictor, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we establish an improved convergence rate of GSIR under additional mild eigenvalue decay rate and smoothness conditions. Our convergence rate can be made arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/3}$ under appropriate decay rate and smoothness parameters. As a comparison, the rate of Li and Song (2017) is $n^{-1/4}$ under the best conditions. This improvement is significant because, for example, in a semiparametric estimation problem involving an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, the convergence rate of the estimator of the nuisance parameter is often required to be faster than $n^{-1/4}$ to guarantee desired semiparametric properties such as asymptotic efficiency. This can be achieved by the improved convergence rate, but not by the original rate. The sharpened convergence rate can also be established for GSIR in more general settings, such as functional sufficient dimension reduction.</description>

      <title>Can Generative Artificial Intelligence Survive Data Contamination? Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.</description>

      <title>Introducing the b-value: combining unbiased and biased estimators from a sensitivity analysis perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In empirical research, when we have multiple estimators for the same parameter of interest, a central question arises: how do we combine unbiased but less precise estimators with biased but more precise ones to improve the inference? Under this setting, the point estimation problem has attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focus on a less studied inference question: how can we conduct valid statistical inference in such settings with unknown bias? We propose a strategy to combine unbiased and biased estimators from a sensitivity analysis perspective. We derive a sequence of confidence intervals indexed by the magnitude of the bias, which enable researchers to assess how conclusions vary with the bias levels. Importantly, we introduce the notion of the b-value, a critical value of the unknown maximum relative bias at which combining estimators does not yield a significant result. We apply this strategy to three canonical combined estimators: the precision-weighted estimator, the pretest estimator, and the soft-thresholding estimator. For each estimator, we characterize the sequence of confidence intervals and determine the bias threshold at which the conclusion changes. Based on the theory, we recommend reporting the b-value based on the soft-thresholding estimator and its associated confidence intervals, which are robust to unknown bias and achieve the lowest worst-case risk among the alternatives.</description>

      <title>Generalised Linear Models Driven by Latent Processes: Asymptotic Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a class of generalised linear models (GLMs) driven by latent processes for modelling count, real-valued, binary, and positive continuous time series. Extending earlier latent-process regression frameworks based on Poisson or one-parameter exponential family assumptions, we allow the conditional distribution of the response to belong to a bi-parameter exponential family, with the latent process entering the conditional mean multiplicatively. This formulation substantially broadens the scope of latent-process GLMs, for instance, it naturally accommodates gamma responses for positive continuous data, enables estimation of an unknown dispersion parameter via method of moments, and avoids restrictive conditions on link functions that arise under existing formulations. We establish the asymptotic normality of the GLM estimators obtained from the GLM likelihood that ignores the latent process, and we derive the correct information matrix for valid inference. In addition, we provide a principled approach to prediction and forecasting in GLMs driven by latent processes, a topic not previously addressed in the literature. We present two real data applications on measles infections in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and paleoclimatic glacial varves, which highlight the practical advantages and enhanced flexibility of the proposed modelling framework.</description>

      <title>Sequential Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Embedded Latent Projection for Robust Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: Conformal inference is a versatile tool for building prediction sets in regression or classification. We study the false coverage proportion (FCP) in a simultaneous inference setting with a calibration sample of $n$ points and a test sample of $m$ points. We identify the exact, distribution-free, asymptotic distribution of the FCP when both $n$ and $m$ tend to infinity. This shows in particular that FCP control can be achieved by using the well-known Kolmogorov distribution, and puts forward that the asymptotic variance is decreasing in the ratio $n/m$. We then provide a number of extensions by considering the problems of novelty detection, weighted conformal inference or distribution shift between the calibration sample and the test sample. In particular, our asymptotic results allow to accurately quantify the asymptotic behavior of the errors (a miscovering interval or declaring a false novelty) when weighted conformal inference is used.</description>

      <title>Large-sample analysis of cost functionals for inference under the coalescent</title>

Abstract: The coalescent is a foundational model of latent genealogical trees under neutral evolution, but suffers from intractable sampling probabilities. Methods for approximating these sampling probabilities either introduce bias or fail to scale to large sample sizes. We show that a class of cost functionals of the coalescent with recurrent mutation and a finite number of alleles converge to tractable processes in the infinite-sample limit. A particular choice of costs yields insight about importance sampling methods, which are a classical tool for coalescent sampling probability approximation. These insights reveal that the behaviour of coalescent importance sampling algorithms differs markedly from standard sequential importance samplers, with or without resampling. We conduct a simulation study to verify that our asymptotics are accurate for algorithms with finite (and moderate) sample sizes. Our results constitute the first theoretical description of large-sample importance sampling algorithms for the coalescent, provide heuristics for the a priori optimisation of computational effort, and identify settings where resampling is harmful for algorithm performance. We observe strikingly different behaviour for importance sampling methods under the infinite sites model of mutation, which is regarded as a good and more tractable approximation of finite alleles mutation in most respects.</description>

      <title>Incomplete U-Statistics of Equireplicate Designs: Berry-Esseen Bound and Efficient Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: U-statistics are a fundamental class of estimators that generalize the sample mean and underpin much of nonparametric statistics. Although extensively studied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high computational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and their non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically requires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel perspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the main analytical tool in this literature but one that is highly sensitive to degeneracy. By characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a Berry-Esseen bound valid for incomplete U-statistics of deterministic designs, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be established even in degenerate cases and when the order diverges. We also introduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics based on equireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain cases, achieve minimum variance. Beyond its theoretical contributions, our framework provides a systematic way to construct permutation-free counterparts to tests based on degenerate U-statistics, as demonstrated in experiments with kernel-based tests using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional learning dynamics of multi-pass Stochastic Gradient Descent in multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $\kappa \asymp n^\alpha$ where $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>From Collapse to Improvement: Statistical Perspectives on the Evolutionary Dynamics of Iterative Training on Contaminated Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of model collapse has presented new challenges in iterative training of generative models, where such training with synthetic data leads to an overall degradation of performance. This paper looks at the problem from a statistical viewpoint, illustrating that one can actually hope for improvement when models are trained on data contaminated with synthetic samples, as long as there is some amount of fresh information from the true target distribution. In particular, we consider iterative training on samples sourced from a mixture of the true target and synthetic distributions. We analyze the entire iterative evolution in a next-token prediction language model, capturing how the interplay between the mixture weights and the sample size controls the overall long-term performance. With non-trivial mixture weight of the true distribution, even if it decays over time, simply training the model in a contamination-agnostic manner with appropriate sample sizes can avoid collapse and even recover the true target distribution under certain conditions. Simulation studies support our findings and also show that such behavior is more general for other classes of models.</description>

      <title>Block Empirical Likelihood Inference for Longitudinal Generalized Partially Linear Single-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized partially linear single-index models (GPLSIMs) provide a flexible and interpretable semiparametric framework for longitudinal outcomes by combining a low-dimensional parametric component with a nonparametric index component. For repeated measurements, valid inference is challenging because within-subject correlation induces nuisance parameters and variance estimation can be unstable in semiparametric settings. We propose a profile estimating-equation approach based on spline approximation of the unknown link function and construct a subject-level block empirical likelihood (BEL) for joint inference on the parametric coefficients and the single-index direction. The resulting BEL ratio statistic enjoys a Wilks-type chi-square limit, yielding likelihood-free confidence regions without explicit sandwich variance estimation. We also discuss practical implementation, including constrained optimization for the index parameter, working-correlation choices, and bootstrap-based confidence bands for the nonparametric component. Simulation studies and an application to the epilepsy longitudinal study illustrate the finite-sample performance.</description>
