      <title>The Ozawa solution to the Davey--Stewartson II equations and surface theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the Ozawa solution to the Davey--Stewartson II equation from the point of view of surface theory by presenting a soliton deformation of surfaces which is ruled by the Ozawa solution. The Ozawa solution blows up at certain moment and we describe explicitly the corresponding singularity of the deformed surface.</description>

      <title>Integrability and exact large deviations of the weakly-asymmetric exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weakly asymmetric exclusion process (WASEP) in one dimension is a paradigmatic system of interacting particles described by the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) in the presence of driving. We consider an initial condition with densities $\rho_1,\rho_2$ on either side of the origin, so that for $\rho_1=\rho_2$ the gas is stationary. Starting from the microscopic description, we obtain exact formulae for the cumulant generating functions, and large deviation rate functions of the time-integrated current and the position of a tracer. As the asymmetry/driving is increased, these describe the crossover between the symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) and the weak noise regime of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation: we recover the two limits and describe the crossover from the WASEP cubic tail to the $5/2$ and $3/2$ KPZ tail exponents. Finally, we show that the MFT of the WASEP is classically integrable, by exhibiting the explicit Lax pairs, which are obtained through a novel mapping between the MFT of the WASEP and a complex extension of the classical anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz spin chain. This shows integrability of all MFTs of asymmetric models with quadratic mobility as well as their dual versions.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real and imaginary parts of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ give rise to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equations. As a generalization of Euler's elastica whose curvature obeys the focusing static MKdV (FSMKdV) equation, we study real plane curves whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation since the FSMKdV equation is a special case of the FGMKdV equation. In this paper, we focus on the hyperelliptic curves of genus three. By tuning some moduli parameters and initial conditions, we show closed real plane curves associated with the FGMKdV equation beyond Euler's figure-eight of elastica.</description>

      <title>The N-species integrable Volterra system as a maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results presented in this paper are a natural development of those described in the paper {\it The Volterra Integrable case. Novel analytical and numerical results} (OCNMP Vol.4 (2024) pp 188-211), where the authors reconsidered the integrable case of the Hamiltonian $N$-species Lotka-Volterra system, introduced by Vito Volterra in 1937. There, an alternative approach for constructing the integrals of motion has been proposed, and compared with the old Volterra approach. Here we go beyond, and show that in fact the model introduced by Volterra and studied by us is not just integrable, but is maximally superintegrable and reducible to a system with only one degree of freedom regardless the number of species considered. We present both analytical and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Bethe/Gauge correspodence: a short review on an aspect of the integrability nature of supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a short review (written in Chinese) on the Bethe/Gauge correspondence. We first explain the basic idea in an explicit example of the correspondence between XXX spin chains and 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauge theories. The connection between 4d and 2d will then be explored by comparing the instanton and vortex partition functions. We conclude this article by briefly mentioning the similarity in the integrability structure of 4d gauge theories and 2d ones from an algebraic aspect, and a potential relation between two different integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>
