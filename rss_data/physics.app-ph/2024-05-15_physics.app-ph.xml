      <title>Nanosecond Electron Holography by Interference Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interference gating is a novel method for robust time-resolved electron holographic measurements by directly switching the interference. Here, a new arrangement is presented in which a biprism in the condenser aperture as a fast electric phase shifter is used to control the interference pattern. High-frequency stimulation of the electric phase shifter in the gigahertz range are performed and observed via electron holography, proving the feasibility of interference gating in the upper picosecond range. Despite the bandwidth limitation of 180~MHz of the current signal generator, a time resolution of 100 nanoseconds is achieved through forward correction of the control signal. With this time resolution, it is already possible to measure the transient response of the biasing holder system. Our method paves the way towards a closer look on fast dynamic processes with high temporal and spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Investigation of BaTiO$_3$-NiO composite as compact Dielectric Resonator Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact dielectric resonator antenna has been fabricated on a microstrip transmission line for the purpose of C-band wireless communication using a ceramic material made out of a sintered mixture of BTO and NiO. The antenna parameters are optimized using Ansys HFSS software and verified experimentally. Ni replaces both Ba at A site and Ti at B site. Such a solid solution has a limit depending on the amount of NiO provided during sintering. A complete study of the structural changes and the dielectric constant enables the correlation with the resonating property. All the samples retain the ferroelectric tetragonal P4mm phase with a nominal decrease in the c/a ratio. NiO incorporation in BTO decreases the sintering temperature and shows two types of morphology associated with BTO-like and NiO-like phases. It induces prominent reduction in the permittivity and loss tangent (&lt;0.01) in the range 100Hz to 1MHz. These properties make these samples suitable for DRA application in the C-Band range [4-8 GHz]. Experimental and theoretical assessment using HFSS software yields a C-band signal at ~7.27 GHz.</description>

      <title>Ballistic-aggregated Carbon Nanofoam in Target-side of Pulsed Laser Deposition for Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pulsed laser deposition, along conventional deposition on frontside of plasma-plume, target is getting coated on its surface too. For reproducibility, cleaning those residues is the most adopted approach. Herein, we investigate the target-side coated materials and employ them as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. Ballistic aggregated target-side nanofoam is compact and contains higher sp2-carbon, higher nitrogen content with higher graphitic-N and lower oxygen content with lower COOH group than that of diffusive aggregated conventional nanofoams. They are highly hydrogenated graphite-like amorphous carbon and superhydrophilic. The symmetric microsupercapacitor delivers higher volumetric capacitance of 522 mF/cm3 at 100 mV/s and 104% retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles over conventional nanofoam (215 mF/cm3 and 85% retention) with the areal capacitance of 134 {\mu}F/cm2 at 120 Hz and ultrafast frequency response. Utilizing those residue materials is of great importance towards sustainable development, zero-waste, and utilization of deposition techniques in full-phase, which is resource-efficient, energy competent and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Investigating the whirling heat current density in the Guyer--Krumhansl equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the numerous heat conduction models, the Guyer--Krumhansl equation has a special role. Besides its various application possibilities in nanotechnology, cryotechnology, and even in case of modeling heterogeneous materials, it poses additional mathematical challenges compared to the Fourier or Cattaneo {(a.k.a. Maxwell--Cattaneo--Vernotte)} equations. Furthermore, the Guyer--Krumhansl equation is the first heat conduction model, which includes the curl of the heat flux density in the evolution equation. In the present paper, we place our focus on the consequences of the existence of such whirling heat current density by solving the two-dimensional Guyer--Krumhansl equation with a space and time-dependent heat pulse boundary condition. The discretization poses further challenges in regard to the boundary condition for which we propose a particular extrapolation method. Furthermore, with the help of the Helmholtz decomposition, we show the analogy with the linearized acoustics of Newtonian fluids, which reveals how the heat flux density plays the role of the velocity field. Our solutions also reveal an unexpected temperature evolution caused by the whirling heat flux density, namely, the temperature can locally be decreased for a short time in a case when the curl of the heat flux density dominates the heat conduction process.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance of Fluorite-Structured Materials for Nanosupercapacitor Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last fifteen years, ferroelectric and antiferroelectric ultra thin films based on fluorite-structured materials have drawn significant attention for a wide variety of applications requiring high integration density. Antiferroelectric $ZrO_2$, in particular, holds significant promise for nanosupercapacitors, owing to its potential for high energy storage density (ESD) and high efficiency ($\eta$). This work assesses the potential of high-performance $Hf_{1-x}Zr_{x}O_2$ thin films encapsulated by TiN electrodes that show linear dielectric (LD), ferroelectric (FE), and antiferroelectric (AFE) behavior. Oxides on silicon are grown by magnetron sputtering and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. ESD and $\eta$ are compared for FE, AFE, and LD samples at the same electrical field (3.5 MV/cm). As expected, ESD is higher for the FE sample ($95 J/cm^3$), but $\eta$ is ridiculously small ($\approx$ 55%), because of the opening of the FE hysteresis curve inducing high loss. Conversely, LD samples exhibit the highest efficiency (nearly 100%), at the expense of a lower ESD. AFE $ZrO_2$ thin film strikes a balance between FE and LD behavior, showing reduced losses compared to the FE sample but an ESD as high as $52 J/cm^3$ at 3.5 MV/cm. This value can be further increased up to $84 J/cm^3$ at a higher electrical field (4.0 MV/cm), with an $\eta$ of 75%, among the highest values reported for fluorite-structured materials, offering promising perspectives for future optimization.</description>

      <title>GHz-rate optical phase shift in light matter interaction-engineered, silicon-ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title>

Abstract: Organic electro-optic (OEO) materials have demonstrated promising performance in developing electro-optic phase shifters (EOPS) and modulators compared to their inorganic counterparts. Integration with other devices in a silicon photonic (SiP) process, simple nanofabrication, and temperature/aging robustness remain to be developed for this class of hybrid material platforms. In particular, electro-optic (EO) polymers need an electro-thermal poling method, which has limited their potential and utilization in large-scale SiP. Devices made of paraelectric nematic liquid crystals (PN-LC), another primary type of OEO material, feature a very efficient but slow phase shift mechanism. We present a general-purpose EOPS that applies to various modulator embodiments to address these concerns. Based on that, we report a GHz-fast phase shift in a newly discovered family of OEO, namely ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FN-LC), which finally enables liquid crystals to have significant second-order nonlinear optical coefficients and associated Pockels effect. The new material avoids poling issues associated with EO polymers and can pave the way for hybrid silicon-OEO systems with CMOS-foundry compatibility. Furthermore, we propose a finger-loaded, non-slotted waveguide that enhances light-matter interaction, allowing us to achieve DC and AC modulation efficiencies of $\approx$ 0.25 V.mm and 25.7 V.mm, respectively, an on-chip insertion loss of $\approx$ 4 dB, and an EO bandwidth of f$_{-6dB}$ &gt;4.18 GHz. The remaining figures of merit for our poling-free EOPS are equivalent to EO polymer-enabled devices with fewer manufacturing difficulties. We demonstrate an electrically and photonically packaged chip that contains &gt;100 silicon-FN-LC modulators to evaluate the large-scale integration of our poling-free phase shifters and modulators.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric actuation for integrated photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent decades have seen significant advancements in integrated photonics, driven by improvements in nanofabrication technology. This field has developed from integrated semiconductor lasers and low-loss waveguides to optical modulators, enabling the creation of sophisticated optical systems on a chip scale capable of performing complex functions like optical sensing, signal processing, and metrology. The tight confinement of optical modes in photonic waveguides further enhances the optical nonlinearity, leading to a variety of nonlinear optical phenomena such as optical frequency combs, second-harmonic generation, and supercontinuum generation. Active tuning of photonic circuits is crucial not only for offsetting variations caused by fabrication in large-scale integration, but also serves as a fundamental component in programmable photonic circuits. Piezoelectric actuation in photonic devices offers a low-power, high-speed solution and is essential in the design of future photonic circuits due to its compatibility with materials like Si and Si3N4, which do not exhibit electro-optic effects. Here, we provide a detailed review of the latest developments in piezoelectric tuning and modulation, by examining various piezoelectric materials, actuator designs tailored to specific applications, and the capabilities and limitations of current technologies. Additionally, we explore the extensive applications enabled by piezoelectric actuators, including tunable lasers, frequency combs, quantum transducers, and optical isolators. These innovative ways of managing photon propagation and frequency on-chip are expected to be highly sought after in the future advancements of advanced photonic chips for both classical and quantum optical information processing and computing.</description>

      <title>Channeling Skyrmions: suppressing the skyrmion Hall effect in ferrimagnetic nanostripes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Skyrmion Hall Effect (SkHE) observed in ferromagnetic (FM) and ferrimagnetic (FI) skyrmions traveling due to a spin-polarized current can be a problematic issue when it comes to technological applications. By investigating the properties of FI skyrmions in racetracks through computational simulations, we have described the nature of their movement based on the relative values of the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and anisotropy coupling constants. Beyond that, using a design strategy, a magnetic channel-like nano-device is proposed in which a spin-polarized current protocol is created to successfully control the channel on which the skyrmion will travel without the adverse SkHE. Additionally, a simple adjustment in the current strength can modify the skyrmion position sideways between different parallel channels in the nanostripe.</description>

      <title>Charge-Transfer Hyperbolic Polaritons in $\alpha$-MoO$_3$/graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transfer is a fundamental interface process that can be harnessed for light detection, photovoltaics, and photosynthesis. Recently, charge transfer was exploited in nanophotonics to alter plasmon polaritons by involving additional non-polaritonic materials to activate the charge transfer. Yet, direct charge transfer between polaritonic materials hasn't been demonstrated. We report the direct charge transfer in pure polaritonic van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$/graphene. We extracted the Fermi energy of 0.6 eV for graphene by infrared nano-imaging of charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons in the vdW heterostructure. This unusually high Fermi energy is attributed to the charge transfer between graphene and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Moreover, we have observed charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons in multiple energy-momentum dispersion branches with a wavelength elongation of up to 150%. With support from the DFT calculation, we find that the charge transfer between graphene and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$, absent in mechanically assembled vdW heterostructures, is attributed to the relatively pristine heterointerface preserved in the epitaxially grown vdW heterostructure. The direct charge transfer and charge transfer hyperbolic polaritons demonstrated in our work hold great promise for developing nano-optical circuits, computational devices, communication systems, and light and energy manipulation devices.</description>

      <title>Scalable single-microring hybrid III-V/Si lasers for emerging narrow-linewidth applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics, compatible with large-scale silicon manufacturing, is a disruptive photonic platform that has indicated significant implications in industry and research areas (e.g., quantum, neuromorphic computing, LiDAR). Cutting-edge applications such as high-capacity coherent optical communication and heterodyne LiDAR have escalated the demand for integrated narrow-linewidth laser sources. To that effect, this work seeks to address this requirement through the development of a high-performance hybrid III-V/silicon laser. The developed integrated laser, utilizes a single microring resonator (MRR), demonstrating single-mode operation with a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) exceeding 40 dB, with laser output power as high as 16.4 mW. Moving away from current hybrid/heterogeneous laser architectures that necessitate multiple complex control, the developed laser architecture requires only two control parameters. Importantly, this serves to streamline industrial adoption by reducing the complexity involved in characterizing these lasers, at-scale. Through the succinct structure and control framework, a narrow laser linewidth of 2.79 kHz and low relative intensity noise (RIN) of -135 dB/Hz are achieved. Furthermore, optical data transmission at 12.5 Gb/s is demonstrated where a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB is measured.</description>

      <title>Virtual melting and cyclic transformations between amorphous Si, Si I, and Si IV in a shear band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual melting (VM) as alternative deformation and stress relaxation mechanisms under extreme load is directly validated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the simple shear of single crystal Si I at a temperature 1,383 K below the melting temperature. The shear band consisting of liquid Si is formed immediately after the shear instability while stress drops to zero. A thermodynamic criterion for VM, which depends on the ratio of the sample to shear band widths, is derived analytically and confirmed by MD simulations. With further shear, the VM immediately transforms to a mixture of low-density amorphous a-Si, Si I, and IV, which undergo cyclic transformations a-Si to and from Si I, a-Si to Si IV, and Si I to and from Si IV with volume fraction of phases mostly between 0.2 and 0.4 and non-repeatable nanostructure evolution. Such cyclic transformations produce additional important carriers for plastic deformation through transformation strain and transformation-induced plasticity due to volume change, which may occur in shear bands in various material systems but missed in experiments and simulations.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators play a pivotal role in superconducting quantum circuits. The ability to fine-tune their resonant frequencies provides enhanced control and flexibility. Here, we introduce a frequency-tunable superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. By applying electrical currents through specifically designed ground wires, we achieve the generation and control of a localized magnetic field on the central line of the resonator, enabling continuous tuning of its resonant frequency. We demonstrate a frequency tuning range of 54.85 MHz in a 6.21 GHz resonator. This integrated and tunable resonator holds great potential as a dynamically tunable filter and as a key component of communication buses and memory elements in superconducting quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency combs, specialized laser sources emitting multiple equidistant frequency lines, have revolutionized science and technology with unprecedented precision and versatility. Recently, integrated frequency combs are emerging as scalable solutions for on-chip photonics. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated superconducting microcomb that is easy to manufacture, simple to operate, and consumes ultra-low power. Our turnkey apparatus comprises a basic nonlinear superconducting device, a Josephson junction, directly coupled to a superconducting microstrip resonator. We showcase coherent comb generation through self-started mode-locking. Therefore, comb emission is initiated solely by activating a DC bias source, with power consumption as low as tens of picowatts. The resulting comb spectrum resides in the microwave domain and spans multiple octaves. The linewidths of all comb lines can be narrowed down to 1 Hz through a unique coherent injection-locking technique. Our work represents a critical step towards fully integrated microwave photonics and offers the potential for integrated quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Indium selenide, In2Se3, has recently attracted growing interest due to its novel properties, including room temperature ferroelectricity, outstanding photoresponsivity, and exotic in-plane ferroelectricity, which open up new regimes for next generation electronics. In2Se3 also provides the important advantage of tuning the electrical properties of ultra-thin layers with an external electrical and magnetic field, making it a potential platform to study novel two-dimensional physics. Yet, In2Se3 has many different polymorphs, and it has been challenging to synthesize single-phase material, especially using scalable growth methods, as needed for technological applications. In this paper, we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy to characterize the microstructure of twin-free single-phase ultra-thin layers of beta-In2Se3, prepared by a unique molecular beam epitaxy approach. We emphasize features of the In2Se3 layer and In2Se3/InP interface which provide evidence for understanding the growth mechanism of the single-phase In2Se3. This novel approach for forming high-quality twin-free single phase two-dimensional crystals on InP substrates is likely to be applicable to other technologically important substrates.</description>

Abstract: Magnonic systems have been a major area of research interest due to their potential benefits in speed and lower power consumption compared to traditional computing. One particular area that they may be of advantage is as Physical Reservoir Computers in machine learning models. In this work, we build on an established design for using an Auto-Oscillation Ring as a reservoir computer by introducing a simple neural network midstream and introduce an additional design using a spin wave guide with a scattering regime for processing data with different types of inputs. We simulate these designs on the new micro magnetic simulation software, Magnum.np, and show that the designs are capable of performing on various real world data sets comparably or better than traditional dense neural networks.</description>

      <title>Optical Widefield Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy</title>

Abstract: Microscopy enables detailed visualization and understanding of minute structures or processes. While cameras have significantly advanced optical, infrared, and electron microscopy, imaging nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals on a camera has remained elusive. Here, we employ nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a quantum sensor, which converts NMR signals into optical signals that are subsequently captured by a high-speed camera. Unlike traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), our method records the NMR signal over a wide field of view in real space. We demonstrate that our optical widefield NMR microscopy (OMRM) can image NMR signals in microfluidic structures with a $\sim 10\,\mu m$ resolution across a $\sim 235 \times 150\,\mu m^2$ area. Crucially, each camera pixel records an NMR spectrum providing multicomponent information about the signal's amplitude, phase, local magnetic field strengths, and gradients. The fusion of optical microscopy and NMR techniques enables multifaceted imaging applications in the physical and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Imaging Localized Variable Capacitance During Switching Processes in Silicon Diodes by Time-Resolved Electron Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interference Gating or iGate is a unique method for ultrafast time-resolved electron holography in a transmission electron microscope enabling a spatiotemporal resolution in the nm and ns regime with a minimal technological effort. Here, iGate is used for the first image-based investigation of the local dynamics of the projected electric potential in the area of the space charge region of two different general purpose silicon diodes during switching between unbiased and reverse biased condition with a temporal resolution of 25ns at a repetition rate of 3MHz. The obtained results for a focus-ion-beam-prepared ultrafast UG1A rectifier diode, which shows a decreasing capacitance with increasing reverse bias are in good agreement with an electric characterization of the macroscopic device as well as with theoretical expectations. For a severely modified 1N4007 device, however, time-resolved electron holography revealed a MOSCAP-like behavior with a rising capacitance in the area of the space charge region during the switching into reverse biased condition. Remarkably, a different behavior, dominated by the effective capacitance of the electrical setup, can be observed in the vacuum region outside both devices within the same measurements, clearly showing the benefits of localized dynamic potentiometry.</description>

      <title>Review of the high-power vacuum tube microwave sources</title>

Abstract: Since the first vacuum tube (X-ray tube) was invented by Wilhelm R\"ontgen in Germany, after more than one hundred years of development, the average power density of the vacuum tube microwave source has reached the order of 108 [MW][GHz]2. The maximum power density record was created by the Free Electron Lasers. In the high-power microwave field, the vacuum devices are still the mainstream microwave sources for applications such as scientific instruments, communications, radars, magnetic confinement fusion heating, microwave weapons, etc. The principles of microwave generation by vacuum tube microwave sources include Cherenkov or Smith-Purcell radiation, transition radiation, and Bremsstrahlung. In this paper, the vacuum tube microwave sources were reviewed in order according to the three radiation principles. Among them, the Vircators can produce 22 GW output power in P-band (0.23-1GHz). Vacuum tubes that can achieve continuous-wave operation include Traveling Wave Tubes, Klystrons, Free Electron Lasers, and Magnetrons, with output power up to 1MW. Vacuum tubes that can generate frequencies of the order of 100 GHz and above include Klystrons, Traveling Wave Tubes, Gyrotrons, Backward Wave Oscillators, Magnetrons, Surface Wave Oscillators, Free Electron Lasers, Orotrons, etc. Gyrotrons are very attractive in the millimeter wave and THz fields. The Gyrotrons can output power at the MW level with 3000s pulse width at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Active learning of effective Hamiltonian for super-large-scale atomic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian scheme provides one of the most accurate modeling technique for large-scale structures, especially for ferroelectrics. However, the parameterization of the effective Hamiltonian is complicated and can be difficult for some complex systems such as high-entropy perovskites. Here, we propose a general form of effective Hamiltonian and develop an active machine learning approach to parameterize the effective Hamiltonian based on Bayesian linear regression. The parameterization is employed in molecular dynamics simulations with the prediction of energy, forces, stress and their uncertainties at each step, which decides whether first-principles calculations are executed to retrain the parameters. Structures of BaTiO$_3$, Pb(Zr$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$)O$_3$ and (Pb,Sr)TiO$_3$ system are taken as examples to show the accuracy of this approach, as compared with conventional parametrization method and experiments. This machine learning approach provides a universal and automatic way to compute the effective Hamiltonian parameters for any considered complex systems with super-large-scale (more than $10^7$ atoms) atomic structures.</description>

      <title>Effective medium properties of stealthy hyperuniform photonic structures using multiscale physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ multiscale physics-informed neural networks (MscalePINNs) for the inverse retrieval of the effective permittivity and homogenization of finite-size photonic media with stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) disordered geometries. Specifically, we show that MscalePINNs are capable of capturing the fast spatial variations of complex fields scattered by arrays of dielectric nanocylinders arranged according to isotropic SHU point patterns, thus enabling a systematic methodology to inverse retrieve their effective dielectric profiles. Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. We believe that the multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.</description>
