      <title>Adaptive AI-Driven Material Synthesis: Towards Autonomous 2D Materials Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are poised to revolutionize current solid-state technology with their extraordinary properties. Yet, the primary challenge remains their scalable production. While there have been significant advancements, much of the scientific progress has depended on the exfoliation of materials, a method that poses severe challenges for large-scale applications. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in materials science, innovative synthesis methodologies are now on the horizon. This study explores the forefront of autonomous materials synthesis using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by evolutionary methods, focusing on the efficient production of graphene. Our approach demonstrates that a neural network can iteratively and autonomously learn a time-dependent protocol for the efficient growth of graphene, without requiring pretraining on what constitutes an effective recipe. Evaluation criteria are based on the proximity of the Raman signature to that of monolayer graphene: higher scores are granted to outcomes whose spectrum more closely resembles that of an ideal continuous monolayer structure. This feedback mechanism allows for iterative refinement of the ANN's time-dependent synthesis protocols, progressively improving sample quality. Through the advancement and application of AI methodologies, this work makes a substantial contribution to the field of materials engineering, fostering a new era of innovation and efficiency in the synthesis process.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photoconductivity in graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photoconductivity response of graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges in the presence of dissipation using a Lindblad-von Neumann master equation formalism. We propose to control the transport properties by illuminating the system with light that is linearly polarized along the finite direction of the nanoribbon while probing along the extended direction. We demonstrate that the largest steady-state photocurrent occurs for a driving frequency that is slightly blue-detuned to the electronic band gap proportional to the width of the nanoribbon. We compare the photoconductivity in the presence of coherent and incoherent light and conclude that the enhancement of the photoconductivity for blue-detuned driving relies on the coherence of the driving term. Based on this result we propose a switching protocol for fast control of the photocurrent on a time scale of a few picoseconds. Furthermore, we suggest a design for a heterostructure of a graphene nanoribbon and a high-Tc superconductor, that is operated as a transistor as a step towards next-generation coherent electronics.</description>

      <title>Topological anomalous Floquet photon pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a close theoretical connection between topological Floquet physics and cavity QED, yet this connection has not been realized experimentally due to complicated cavity QED models that often arise. We propose a simple, experimentally viable protocol to realize non-adiabatic topological photon pumping mediated by a single qubit, which we dub the anomalous Floquet photon pump. For both quantized photons and external drive, the system exhibits a non-trivial topological phase across a broad range of parameter space. Transitions out of the topological phase result from frequency-space delocalization. Finally, we argue that the protocol can be implemented in existing experiments via driven qubit non-linearities, with topological pumping witnessed in measurements of the cavity Wigner distribution functions.</description>

      <title>High spatial resolution charge sensing of quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge distribution offers a unique fingerprint of important properties of electronic systems, including dielectric response, charge ordering and charge fractionalization. We develop a new architecture for charge sensing in two-dimensional electronic systems in a strong magnetic field. We probe local change of the chemical potential in a proximitized detector layer using scanning tunneling microscopy (STS), allowing us to infer the chemical potential and the charge profile in the sample. Our technique has both high energy (&lt;0.3 meV) and spatial (&lt;10 nm) resolution exceeding that of previous studies by an order of magnitude. We apply our technique to study the chemical potential of quantum Hall liquids in monolayer graphene under high magnetic fields and their responses to charge impurities. The chemical potential measurement provides a local probe of the thermodynamic gap of quantum Hall ferromagnets and fractional quantum Hall states. The screening charge profile reveals spatially oscillatory response of the quantum Hall liquids to charge impurities, and is consistent with the composite Fermi liquid picture close to the half-filling. Our technique also paves the way to map moir\'e potentials, probe Wigner crystals, and investigate fractional charges in quantum Hall and Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Pole and zero edge state invariant for 1D non-Hermitian sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several criteria for the existence of topological edge states in 1D non-Hermitian two-band sublattice-symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonians. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach in Ref. [1, 2] uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. The pole-zero approach in Ref. [3] uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form. We give numerical examples for these invariants.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Driven Magnetothermal Transport in Magnetic Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-solid-state nanoscale devices capable of efficiently controlling a heat flow are crucial for advanced thermal management technologies. Here we predict a magnon-driven magnetothermal resistance (mMTR) effect in multilayers of ferromagnets and normal metals, i.e. a thermal resistance that varies when switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization orientations of the ferromagnetic layers, even in the absence of conduction electrons in the ferromagnets. The mMTR arises from an interfacial temperature drop caused by magnon spin accumulations and can be engineered by the layer thicknesses, spin diffusion lengths, and spin conductances. The mMTR predicted here enables magnetothermal switching in insulator-based systems; we already predict large mMTR ratios up to 40$\%$ for superlattices of the electrically insulating magnet yttrium iron garnet and elemental metals.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Quantum Properties and Functionalities of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competing magnetic interactions may stabilize smooth magnetization textures that can be characterized by a topological winding number. Such textures, which are spatially localized within a two-dimensional plane, are commonly known as skyrmions. On the classical level, their significance for fundamental science and their potential for applications, ranging from spintronic devices to unconventional computation platforms, have been intensively investigated in recent years. This Colloquium considers quantum effects associated with skyrmion textures: their theoretical origins, the experimental and material challenges associated with their detection, and the promise of exploiting them for quantum operations. Starting with classical skyrmions, we discuss their magnon and electron excitations and show how hybrid architectures offer new platforms for engineering quantum orders, including topological superconductivity. We then focus on the quantization of the skyrmion texture itself and formulate the long-time skyrmion dynamics in terms of collective coordinates. Next, we discuss the quantization of helicity and phenomena of macroscopic quantum tunneling: key concepts that fundamentally distinguish quantum skyrmions from their classical counterparts. Looking ahead, we propose material classes suitable for the realization of skyrmions in quantum spin systems and identify device architectures with the promise of achieving quantum operations. We close by addressing the advances in experimental methods which will be a prerequisite for resolving the quantum aspects of topological spin patterns, sensing their local dynamical response, and achieving their predicted functionalities in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Cotunneling assisted nonequilibrium thermodynamics of a photosynthetic junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a photosystem II-based reaction center modeled as a nonequilibrium quantum junction. We specifically focus on the electron-electron interactions that enable cotunneling events to be captured through quantum mechanical rates due to the inclusion of a negatively charged manybody state. Using a master equation framework with realistic spectral profiles, we analyze the cotunneling assisted current, power, and work. Amplification of the cotunneling assisted current and power occurs over a narrower bias range, reflecting a trade-off where higher flux is compensated by a reduced work window. We further report that the cotunneling-enhanced thermodynamic variables, particularly within specific bias windows, depends on the interplay between cotunneling amplitudes, electron transition rates, and interaction energy. Both attractive and repulsive electronic interactions can enhance cotunneling, but this effect is sensitive to the energy balance between states and the tunneling strength asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Study of Electronic Properties and Photoionization Process in Rotating 2D Quantum Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic and optical properties of a mesoscopic heterostructure of a two-dimensional quantum ring composed of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors are investigated. Using the confinement potential proposed by Tan-Inkson to describe the system under analysis, we conducted a numerical study of the photoionization cross section for a 2D quantum ring with and without rotation effects. The interior of the quantum ring is traversed by an AB flux. Our research aims to investigate how this mesoscopic structure's electronic and optical properties respond to variations in the following parameters: average radius, AB flux, angular velocity, and incident photon energy. Under these conditions, we establish that optical transitions occur from the ground state to the next excited state in the conduction sub-band, following a specific selection rule. One of the fundamental objectives of this study is to analyze how these rules can influence the general properties of two-dimensional quantum rings. To clarify the influence of rotation on the photoionization process within the system, we offer findings that illuminate the effects of the pertinent physical parameters within the described model. We emphasize that, although this is a review, it provides critical commentary, analysis, and new perspectives on existing research. Some results presented in this paper can be compared with those in the literature; however, new physical parameters and quantum ring configurations are used.</description>

      <title>Quantum Band Structure and Topology in One Dimensional Modulated Plasmonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band structures of electrons in a periodic potential are well-known to host topologies that impact their behaviors at edges and interfaces. The concept however is more general than the single-electron setting. In this work, we consider topology of plasmons in a two-dimensional metal, subject to a unidirectional periodicity. We show how the plasmon modes and wavefunctions may be computed for such a periodic system, by focusing on the confined, quantized photon degrees of freedom associated with the plasmon modes. At low frequencies the plasmons disperse with wavevector as $\sqrt{q}$; however at higher frequencies one finds a series of bands and gaps in the spectrum. For a unidirectional periodic electron density with inversion symmetry, we show that each band hosts a Zak phase $\gamma_n$ which may only take the values $0$ or $\pi$. Each gap has a topological index $\nu$ that is determined by the sum of the Zak phases below it. When the system has an interface with the vacuum, one finds in-gap modes for gaps with non-trivial topologies, which are confined to the interface. In addition, interfaces between systems that are the same except for their topologies -- which can be created by a defect in the lattice in which half a unit cell has been removed -- host in-gap, confined states when the topological indices of the relevant gaps are different. We demonstrate these properties numerically by analyzing a Kronig-Penney-type model in graphene, in which the electron density is piecewise constant, modulating between two different densities. In addition, we consider a related plasmon system modeled after the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We show that the topological phase diagram of the lowest energy bands is highly analogous to that of the SSH tight-binding system.</description>

      <title>Valley-spin polarization at zero magnetic field induced by strong hole-hole interactions in monolayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as prominent candidates to explore the complex interplay between the spin and the valleys degrees of freedom. The strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry within these materials lead to the spin-valley locking effect, in which carriers occupying the K and K' valleys of the reciprocal space must have opposite spin depending on which valley they reside. This effect is particularly strong for holes due to a larger spin-orbit gap in the valence band. By reducing the dimensionality of a monolayer of tungsten diselenide to 1D via electrostatic confinement, we demonstrate that spin-valley locking in combination with strong hole-hole interactions lead to a ferromagnetic state in which hole transport through the 1D system is spin-valley polarized, even without an applied magnetic field, and that the persistence of this spin-valley polarized configuration can be tuned by a global back-gate. This observation opens the possibility of implementing a robust and stable valley polarized system, essential for valleytronic applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalously Enhanced Diffusivity of Moir\'e Excitons via Manipulating the Interplay with Correlated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) moir\'e superlattice provides an exciting platform for manipulating excitons. The in-situ control of moir\'e potential confined exciton would usher in unprecedented functions of excitonic devices but remains challenging. Meanwhile, as a dipolar composite boson, interlayer exciton in the type-II aligned TMDC moir\'e superlattice strongly interacts with fermionic charge carriers. Here, we demonstrate active manipulation of the exciton diffusivity by tuning their interplay with correlated carriers in moir\'e potentials. At fractional fillings where carriers are known to form generalized Wigner crystals, we observed suppressed diffusivity of exciton. In contrast, in Fermi liquid states where carriers dynamically populate all moir\'e traps, the repulsive carrier-exciton interaction can effectively reduce the moir\'e potential confinement seen by the exciton, leading to enhanced diffusivity with the increase of the carrier density. Notably, the exciton diffusivity is enhanced by orders of magnitude near the Mott insulator state, and the enhancement is much more pronounced for the 0-degree than the 60-degree aligned WS2/WSe2 heterobilayer due to the more localized nature of interlayer excitons. Our study inspires further engineering and controlling exotic excitonic states in TMDC moir\'e superlattices for fascinating quantum phenomena and novel excitonic devices.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Entanglement and Quantum Sensing from Energy Transfer in two-tone Floquet Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced sensors, which surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL) and approach the fundamental precision limits dictated by quantum mechanics, are finding applications across a wide range of scientific fields. This quantum advantage becomes particularly significant when a large number of particles are included in the sensing circuit. Achieving such enhancement requires introducing and preserving entanglement among many particles, posing significant experimental challenges. In this work, we integrate concepts from Floquet theory and quantum information to design an entangler capable of generating the desired entanglement between two paths of a quantum interferometer. We demonstrate that our path-entangled states enable sensing beyond the SQL, reaching the fundamental Heisenberg limit (HL) of quantum mechanics. Moreover, we show that a decoding parity measurement maintains the HL when specific conditions from Floquet theory are satisfied$\unicode{x2013}$particularly those related to the periodic driving parameters that preserve entanglement during evolution. We address the effects of a priori phase uncertainty and imperfect transmission, showing that our method remains robust under realistic conditions. Finally, we propose a superconducting-circuit implementation of our sensor in the microwave regime, highlighting its potential for practical applications in high-precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement from many-electron systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of entanglement in atomistic systems requires a combination of advanced ab initio calculations - to account for the effect of the electron-electron interaction - and rigorous quantum-informational theoretical analyses. This combination is a challenging task that has not been tackled so far to investigate genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) in materials. Here we show, contrary to conventional wisdom, that a high degree of GME can be extracted from closed-shell molecular states - even in the non-interacting limit. Because the relevant states fulfill the super-selection rules, the generated entanglement may in principle represent also a physical resource.</description>

      <title>Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators: An efficient numerical approach for fermionic path integral simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing numerical exact solvers for open quantum systems is a challenging task due to the non-perturbative and non-Markovian nature when coupling to structured environments. The Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach is a powerful analytical tool to study the dynamics of open quantum systems. Numerical treatments of the influence functional including the quasi-adiabatic propagator technique and the tensor-network-based time-evolving matrix product operator method, have proven to be efficient in studying open quantum systems with bosonic environments. However, the numerical implementation of the fermionic path integral suffers from the Grassmann algebra involved. In this work, we present a detailed introduction of the Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for fermionic open quantum systems. In particular, we introduce the concepts of Grassmann tensor, signed matrix product operator, and Grassmann matrix product state to handle the Grassmann path integral. Using the single-orbital Anderson impurity model as an example, we review the numerical benchmarks for structured fermionic environments for real-time nonequilibrium dynamics, real-time and imaginary-time equilibration dynamics, and its application as an impurity solver. These benchmarks show that our method is a robust and promising numerical approach to study strong coupling physics and non-Markovian dynamics. It can also serve as an alternative impurity solver to study strongly-correlated quantum matter with dynamical mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Multiplexing with Solid-State Integrated Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) of cryogenic signal lines is a promising technique that can significantly reduce the required space, minimize the cooldown time, and increase the number of measurable quantum devices per cooldown. Here, we report the TDM of supercurrent with a 1-input-8-outputs voltage-actuated hybrid superconducting demultiplexer for the first time. The device comprises 14 ON/OFF InAsOI-based superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) routed with Al traces. Each JoFET features Al as a superconductor and HfO2 as a gate insulator, and it can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal-state resistance by 20 times with a gate voltage of -4.5 V. The superconducting demultiplexer operates up to 100 MHz at 50 mK, features an insertion loss of ~ 0 dB in the superconducting state, and an OFF/ON ratio of ~ 17.5 dB in a 50-Ohm-matched cryogenic measurement setup. The frequency operation range can be extended by designing the demultiplexer with a proper microwave signal transport layout minimizing, at the same time, the impact of the parasitic electrical elements. These achievements open up the practical implementation of superconducting TDM as a key to drastically reducing I/O lines, costs, and space occupation in a cryostat, enabling the scalability of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Lateral plasmonic crystals: Tunability, dark modes, and weak-to-strong coupling transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study transmission of the terahertz radiation through a two-dimensional electron gas with a concentration controlled by grating gate electrodes. Voltage applied to these electrodes creates a lateral plasmonic crystal with a gate-tunable band structure. We find that only a part of plasmonic modes of such a crystal is seen in the transmission spectrum for the case of homogeneous excitation (so-called bright modes), while there also exist dark modes which show up only in a case of inhomogeneous excitation. We develop a theory that describes both weak- to strong- coupling transition in the crystal with increasing depth of the density modulation and a transition from resonant to super-resonant regime with increasing quality factor of the structure. We discuss very recent experiment, where transmission of the terahertz radiation through GaN/AlGaN based grating gate periodic structures was studied. We argue that this experiment represents an evidence of formation of the lateral plasmonic crystal with the band structure fully controlled by the gate electrodes, in a full agreement with developed theory</description>

Abstract: Qubits that can be efficiently controlled are essential for the development of scalable quantum hardware. While resonant control is used to execute high-fidelity quantum gates, the scalability is challenged by the integration of high-frequency oscillating signals, qubit crosstalk and heating. Here, we show that by engineering the hopping of spins between quantum dots with site-dependent spin quantization axis, quantum control can be established with discrete signals. We demonstrate hopping-based quantum logic and obtain single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.97\%, coherent shuttling fidelities of 99.992\% per hop, and a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.3\%, corresponding to error rates that have been predicted to allow for quantum error correction. We also show that hopping spins constitute a tuning method by statistically mapping the coherence of a 10-quantum dot system. Our results show that dense quantum dot arrays with sparse occupation could be developed for efficient and high-connectivity qubit registers.</description>

Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect can be observed in a two-dimensional conductor penetrated by a perpendicular magnetic field and with edges connecting the current carrying contacts. Its signature is a state of quantized Hall and simultaneously vanishing longitudinal resistances. A widely accepted model is the Landauer-B\"uttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by current carrying one-dimensional edge channels. This single-particle model is challenged by the screening theory. It derives, that electron-electron interaction leads to a fragmentation of the Hall bar into compressible and incompressible strips, where the latter gradually shift from the sample edges into the bulk with increasing magnetic field. This suggests a transition from edge to bulk current if we associate current flow with incompressible strips. We present a direct experimental proof of this transition from edge to bulk current. Our results support the screening theory.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion crystal phase on a magnetic domain wall in chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromegnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Microwave radiation at criticality in a hybrid Josephson array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous metallic behavior is often observed near superconductor-insulator quantum critical points and, if persistent to zero temperature, poses a challenge to current theories of metals. One explanation for this behavior could be incomplete thermal equilibrium between the sample and the cryostat. However, despite decades of study, the temperature of an anomalous metal has not yet been measured. We introduce a new experimental probe by capturing microwave radiation emitted from the anomalous metal, using a two-dimensional array of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Josephson junctions as a model system. The total emitted radiation exceeds the limits of thermodynamic equilibrium, and is well described by an elevated sample temperature. The extracted sample temperature matches the onset of anomalous metallic behavior. Additionally, we discover scaling behavior of radiative noise in the presence of an applied bias. Elements of our noise-scaling observations were predicted based on nonlinear critical field theories and gauge-gravity duality between current noise and Hawking radiation from a black hole. This work shows that, in a prominent model system, anomalous metallic behavior is a non-equilibrium effect, and opens a new frontier in the study of universal, non-equilibrium phenomena near quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Probing topological phases in a perturbed Kane-Mele model via RKKY interaction: Application to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) are promising for spintronics, leveraging strong spin-orbit coupling for efficient spin manipulation via electrical and optical methods, with potential applications in memory storage, quantum computing, and spin-based logic. While the Kane-Mele model effectively captures the low-energy physics of these materials, the impact of perturbations driving phase transitions is less well understood. Developing approaches to describe these phases is crucial. Here, we study the noncollinear Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic impurities in a \textit{perturbed} Kane-Mele model with strong spin-orbit coupling, relevant to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ as a prominent QSHI. By analyzing RKKY interactions, we reveal distinct, relative (rather than absolute) signatures of the different phase transitions induced by static and dynamic perturbations based on their impact on magnetic impurities. We then employ these perturbations to switch between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic or clockwise and counterclockwise magnetic interactions for control processes. Our results offer a practical way to track topological phases via magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Reentrant Non-Hermitian Skin Effect Induced by Correlated Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder drastically influences the system's localization properties, giving rise to intriguing quantum phenomena. Although the intrinsic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is robust against weak disorder even in a one-dimensional system, it becomes Anderson localization under strong disorder. Here, we study an Anderson localization-delocalization transition by coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson (HN) chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorders anti-symmetrically correlated with each other. Regardless of the disorder strength, as the inter-chain coupling strength increases, an Anderson delocalization can occur. This leads to a reentrant NHSE due to the interplay of nonreciprocal hopping and correlated disorder. Furthermore, the Anderson localization-delocalization transition is well captured by the real-space winding number. This reentrant NHSE, under anti-symmetric disorder, is a remarkably nontrivial physical phenomenon without a Hermitian counterpart. We then experimentally test this phenomenology by implementing our model in electrical circuits, and observe the reentrant NHSE by measuring the voltage response.</description>

      <title>Tunable second-order Josephson response in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of external electric and Zeeman fields on the Josephson response in a planar superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor junction. Remarkably, we discover that the current-phase relation can be forward- or backward-skewed due to significant second-order Josephson response. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength. Such a second-order Josephson response can be measured directly by double SQUID devices. Additionally, the skewness can be effectively manipulated by electric gating. Furthermore, we reveal two additional impacts of external fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current. Our study opens a new avenue for exploring the second-order Josephson response in altermagnets.</description>
