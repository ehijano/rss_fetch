      <title>Interaction induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state and dynamical properties of ultracold gases in optical lattices with an aperiodic external potential-a scenario motivated by recent experiments on twisted bilayer optical lattices and optical quasicrystals. Our study reveals that the interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and a quasiperiodic potential gives rise to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose glass (BG) phase, characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions, into a SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively characterized by monitoring the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: as the on-site interaction increases, the system initially transitions from BG to SF, but further increase restores the BG phase. This reentrance is ascribed to an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a once percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsive interactions dominate. Furthermore, our analysis of quench dynamics demonstrates distinct transient behaviors. Intra-phase quenches yield minimal variations in both the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the particle density distribution. In contrast, inter-phase quenches produce pronounced effects; for instance, a quench from the SF to BG phase is marked by an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, while a BG-to-SF quench features oscillatory changes in the percolation probability and a gradual decrease in the IPR, eventually stabilizing the SF phase. Our findings unveil the complex interplay between disorder and interaction in ultracold Bose gases, offering valuable insights that are highly pertinent to current experimental efforts employing twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattice platforms.</description>

      <title>Dual spectroscopy of quantum simulated Fermi-Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Genuine Quantum effects in Dicke-type Models at large atom numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of genuine quantum effects and beyond mean-field physics in the balanced and unbalanced open Dicke model with a large, yet finite number of atoms $N$. Such driven and dissipative quantum many-body systems have recently been realized in experiments involving ultracold gases inside optical cavities and are known to obey mean-field predictions in the thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$. Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite $N$, by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic $N\approx 1000$. While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing $N$ in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic $N$. They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description. This is due to the fact that the steady-state limit $t\rightarrow \infty$ and thermodynamic limit $N\rightarrow \infty$ do not commute.</description>

      <title>Blue repulsive potential for dysprosium Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-wavelength repulsive potentials for quantum gases allow to realize new systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.</description>

      <title>Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, and use them to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise-correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as an important general tool to probe and identify many-body states of quantum gases, extending its application to previously inaccessible correlation properties in multimode systems.</description>

      <title>Autoionization-enhanced Rydberg dressing by fast contaminant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of spin-squeezing achieved during early-time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.</description>

      <title>Efficient shortcuts-to-adiabaticity for loading an ultracold Fermi gas into higher orbital bands of one-dimensional optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to load ultracold Fermi gases from the ground orbital band of a one-dimensional optical lattice into the first excited orbital band. Unlike the narrow momentum distribution of a Bose-Einstein Condensate, Fermi gases exhibit a broad momentum distribution. To address this, we define the average loading efficiency across all quasi-momentum states and theoretically perform the loading operation simultaneously for each Bloch state. Using a multiparameter global optimization method, we determine the loading efficiency at various lattice depths. We can enhance the loading efficiency by adjusting the phase of the lattice, which leverages the different symmetries of Bloch wavefunctions in various optical lattice orbitals. We also identified that the primary factor hindering higher loading efficiency in the Fermi gas is the multiple occupancy of the quasi-momentum states. Our simulations of various occupancies revealed a decreasing trend in mean loading efficiency as the number of occupied quasi-momentum states increases. Finally, we compare our method with other loading techniques and assess its experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Emergent Continuous Time Crystal in Dissipative Quantum Spin System without Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are a nonequilibrium phase of matter that extend fundamental spontaneous symmetry breaking into the temporal dimension, typically requiring external driving for their realization. Here, we explore the nonequilibrium phase diagram of a two-dimensional dissipative Heisenberg spin system without external coherent or incoherent driving. Through numerical analysis of spin dynamics, we identify nonstationary steady states, some of which are limit cycles with persistent periodic oscillations, while others exhibit chaotic, aperiodic behavior. The emergence of limit cycle steady states breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry of this time-independent many-body system, classifying them as continuous time crystals. We further validate these oscillatory behaviors by testing their stability against local perturbations and assess the robustness of the emergent continuous time crystals by introducing isotropic Gaussian white noise. This work provides insights into the intricate interplay between the dissipation and spin interaction, and opens possibilities for realizing dissipation-induced, heating-immune time crystals.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>
