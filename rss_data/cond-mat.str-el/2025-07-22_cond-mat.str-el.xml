      <title>Spin orientation -- a subtle interplay between strain and multipole Coulomb interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown on piezoelectric substrates.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Spiral renormalization group flow and universal entanglement spectrum of the non-Hermitian 5-state Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Probing the band structure of the strongly correlated antiferromagnet NiPS3 across its phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals. Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the magnetic ground states of RECo$_5$ permanent magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent improvements in the theory of rare earth magnets, as well as the availability of improved neutron powder diffraction data on these materials, we revisit the magnetic single-ion properties of SmCo$_5$ and the magnetic structures of YCo$_5$ and NdCo$_5$. From neutron diffraction patterns in a wide range of temperatures between 3 K and 800 K, we obtain the thermal coefficient expansion and the magnetic moment values for the latter two materials. For SmCo$_5$, we fit existing neutron spectroscopy data with a model recently used for NdCo$_5$ to obtain the crystal field parameters, which are essential to determine the low-lying energy scales that set the Hamiltonian. Our results may trigger new experimental and theoretical studies towards a new route for the realization of permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the origin of long-range ferromagnetic order in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by low-energy magnon excitation studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed high-field/high-frequency ferromagnetic resonance (HF-FMR) study of low-energy magnon excitations in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. At 2 K, the field dependence of the magnon branches is well described by a semiclassical domain-based model, from which we extract key microscopic parameters including the anisotropy gap $\Delta = 170\pm 4$ GHz, the anisotropy field $B_{\rm A} = 5.85\pm 0.08$ T, and the effective $g$-factor $g_{\rm ab}\simeq g_{\rm c} = 2.07(4)$. Furthermore the uniaxial anisotropy constant was determined to be $K = (10.5\pm 0.23) \times 10^{-6}$ erg/cm$^3$. Anisotropic short-range magnetic order persists above $T_{\rm C}$ up to approximately 270 K, as evidenced by a finite anisotropy gap and anisotropic shifts in the FMR resonance fields. Both results clearly show the presence of anisotropic local magnetic fields well above $T_{\rm C}$. Our findings underscore the crucial role of magneto-crystalline anisotropy in driving long-range magnetic order in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagrams of Antiferromagnet DyB12 with Jahn-Teller Lattice Instability and Electron Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of charge transport and magnetization anisotropy was studied in DyB12, an antiferromagnetic (AF) metal with Neel temperature TN = 16.3 K that exhibits both cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions of the fcc crystal structure and nanoscale electronic instabilities (dynamic charge stripes). Based on the results obtained the magnetic field (H) vs temperature (T) phase diagrams have been constructed. Moreover, from angle dependent magnetoresistance and magnetization measurements the butterfly-type patterns of the H-phi magnetic phase diagram in the (110) plane were created, which include a number of different magnetic phases separated from each other by radial and circular boundaries. Several positive and negative contributions to magnetoresistance were separated and analyzed, providing arguments in favor of the important role of the spin density wave 5d-component in the magnetic structure of AF state. We argue that charge fluctuations in stripes are responsible for the suppression of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) indirect exchange between the nearest neighbored Dy3+ ions located along the same 110 directions, as these dynamic charge stripes produce the magnetic phase diversity and the butterfly-type anisotropy in DyB12.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit crossover and the origin of magnetic torque in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15527v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a curious phase transition-like feature: a nematic magnetic torque response that abruptly sets in at $T_\tau \approx 130$K, above the known charge density wave transition at $T_\text{CDW} \approx 100$K. Counterintuitively, elastoresistance measurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal, ruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on possible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for in-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane magnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination of features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband magnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial symmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain field, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural explanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\tau$ is understood as a crossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength. Our theory accounts for the nematic magnetic torque, hysteresis, and the transition-like onset at $T_\tau$, while also making testable predictions, including strain-induced magnetisation. In doing so, it challenges the prevailing view of the normal state.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Prolate 4$f$ Monomers: Numerical Predictions and Experimental Validation of Electronic Properties and Slow Relaxation in a Muffin-shaped Er$^\mathrm{III}$ Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic properties of the triply-capped, slightly distorted trigonal-prismatic complex [Er(PPTMP)$_2$(H$_2$O)][OTf]$_3$ (PPTMP = (4-(6-(1,10-phenanthrolin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)methyl pivalate) ($\mathbf{1}$). Complex $\mathbf{1}$ is shown to exhibit field-induced slow relaxation of the magnetisation at $B = 0.1\,\mathrm{T}$ via two distinct relaxation paths. Using tunable high-frequency/high-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we experimentally determine the effective $g$-factors and zero field splittings of the two energetically lowest Kramers doublets (KD). Our data reveal that the triply-capped, slightly distorted trigonal-prismatic ligand field favours an $m \simeq \pm 9/2$ magnetic ground state, while the main contribution to the first excited KD at $\Delta_{1 \rightarrow 2} = 780(5)\,\mathrm{GHz}$ is suggested to be $m \simeq \pm 5/2$. The ground state $g$-tensor has generally axial form but hosts significant transversal components, which we conclude to be the source of SMM-silent behaviour in zero field. Our findings are backed up by ab-initio spin-orbit configuration interaction calculations showing excellent agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystal and perfect many-body tunneling in a periodically driven Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain driven by a periodic magnetic field. Based on its instantaneous integrability and inherent symmetry, we analytically study the magnetization and many-body tunneling (MBT). Both of them exhibit periodicity distinct from the driving period. The magnetization is shown to be independent of the initial state and robust against perturbations, signaling the formation of discrete time crystal (DTC) order. The DTC phase is found to be continuously tunable through magnetic field. The system exhibits perfect MBT, manifested as exactly vanishing Loschmidt echo (LE) thus divergent LE rate function at half period of the DTC. Remarkably, the perfect MBT is independent of the system size, and can be traced to an effective gap closure induced by quantum geometric effects. Furthermore, the Loschmidt echo spectra entropy shows logarithmic-dependence on system size, consistent with non-thermal nature of the DTC phase. We propose a protocol using ultracold atoms for experimental realization of the DTC and MBT.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced nematic Dirac semimetal from quadratic band touching: A constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and three-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome metals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest concerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties. However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Disordered purification phase transition in hybrid random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu &lt; 2$ for uniform probability to $\nu &gt; 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially (quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition, leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement remains.</description>

      <title>Irrational CFTs from coupled anyon chains with non-invertible symmetries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq2$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. As a byproduct of our analysis, we provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1&lt;c&lt;2.1$.</description>

      <title>A new collective mode in an iron-based superconductor with electronic nematicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidation of the symmetry and structure of order parameter(OP) is a fundamental subject in the study of superconductors. Recently, a growing number of superconducting materials have been identified that suggest additional spontaneous symmetry breakings besides the primal breaking of U(1) gauge symmetry, including time-reversal, chiral, and rotational symmetries. Observation of collective modes in those exotic superconductors is particularly important, as they provide the fingerprints of the superconducting OP. Here we investigate the collective modes in an iron-based superconductor, FeSe, a striking example of superconductivity emergent in an electronic nematic phase where the rotational symmetry of electronic degree of freedom is spontaneously broken. By using terahertz nonlinear spectroscopy technique, we discovered a collective mode resonance located substantially below the superconducting gap energy, distinct from the amplitude Higgs mode. Comparison with theoretical calculations demonstrates that the observed mode is attributed to a collective fluctuation between the s+d-wave-like ground state and the subleading pairing channel, which corresponds to the so-called Bardasis-Schrieffer mode but also resembles an intraband Leggett mode. Our result corroborates the multicomponent pairing channels in FeSe activated in the lower space group symmetry in the electronic nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Anomalous temperature dependence of local magnetic fields in altermagnetic MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel type of magnetic system that has a spin-polarised electric band structure in the absence of a net magnetic moment, leading to exciting prospects in potential device applications. Hexagonal MnTe, a prototypical altermagnet, has arguably shown the most properties consistent with theoretical predictions, including an anomalous Hall effect despite no net magnetisation, and strong altermagnet-induced spin splitting in the electronic band structure. Here we present muon-spin spectroscopy measurements of a single crystal of MnTe. Below room temperature we observe pronounced anomalies in the muon-spin depolarisation, as well as the onset of a second, non-proportional internal field in the absence of an applied field. These findings point to a change in the magnetic structure around $T\simeq250$ K, which coincides with other changes in reported properties, such as transport.</description>

      <title>Interference and short-range correlation in fermionic Hubbard gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interference patterns of ultracold atoms, observed after ballistic expansion from optical lattices, encode essential information about strongly correlated lattice systems, including phase coherence and non-local correlations. While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Granovskii-Zhedanov Scar of XYZ Spin-chain: Modern Algebraic Perspectives and Realization in Higher Dimensional Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero entanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains; remarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a subject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding of quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be effectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) framework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This description, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of these standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques: approximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar subspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar subspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange systems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar construction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be supported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination numbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in specific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$ symmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial uniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in systems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of edges.</description>

Abstract: Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.</description>

      <title>Transversal non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes breaking the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier and quantum-inspired geometry with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ systolic freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, a $\sqrt{N}log^{1/2}(N)$ distance barrier for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with $N$ qubits persisted for nearly two decades, until the recent discovery of the fibre-bundle code. An open question is whether such a distance barrier can be broken while preserving the ability to perform transversal non-Clifford gates. In this direction, another long-standing distance barrier of $N^{1/3}$ for LDPC stabilizer codes -- present since the discovery of the 3D color code -- was only recently overcome by a construction achieving an $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ distance (arXiv:2501.19375). The present work further breaks the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier by taking a homological product of three good qLDPC codes, combined with the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping and the triple cup product to implement transversal CCZ gates. The resulting code achieves an $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distance (a linear $X$-distance of $\Theta(N)$) and a dimension of $\Theta(N^{2/3})$, which enables fault-tolerant preparation of $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ independent logical CCZ magic states in a single shot, without distillation (`magic state fountain'). This new quantum code also inspires the discovery of a family of exotic $3q$-dimensional manifolds $\mathcal{M}$, which exhibit both a power-law $\mathbb{Z}_2$-($q$, $2q$)-systolic freedom and $\Theta(vol(\mathcal{M}))$ triple intersection points of $2q$-dimensional submanifolds.</description>

      <title>General scaling behavior of superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of high-$T_c$ superconductors, which has been a major topic in condensed matter physics for more than thirty years, reveals some features of conventional superconductors. We analyze the scaling of the condensation energy $E_{\Delta}$ divided by $\gamma$, $E_{\Delta}/\gamma\simeq N(0)\Delta_1^2/\gamma$, that equally applicable to both conventional and unconventional high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here $N(0)$ is the density of states, $\Delta_1$ is the maximum value of the superconducting gap and $\gamma$ is the Sommerfeld coefficient. Basing on this observation, we analyze experimental facts that reveal the general scaling properties of both high-$T_c$ and ordinary superconductors, and theoretically explain that the Homes' law $\rho_{s0}= (1/2\pi\lambda_D)^2= T_c\sigma(T_c)$ is applicable to the both types of superconductors. Here $\rho_{s0}$ is the superconducting electron density, $\lambda_D$ is the zero-$T$ penetration depth, $\sigma$ is the normal state conductivity, $T$ is temperature and $T_c$ is the temperature of superconduction phase transition. For the first time, we also explain the reason of violation of the Homes' law. Our theoretical results agree well with experimental facts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking of continuous symmetries by extended dynamical defects entails the existence of continuous families of defects, which form conformal manifolds in a critical setup. In the presence of bulk 't Hooft anomalies, defects are in fact required to break the symmetry: defect conformal manifolds are anomaly-enforced. We show that, by coupling the system to a modulated deformation parameter, the geometric structure of the conformal manifold is sensible to the 't Hooft anomaly. This leads to measurable effects in the presence of a boundary/defect: in (1+1)d the anomaly predicts a quantized boundary charge pumping, while in higher dimensions it gives rise to non-dissipative boundary Hall currents.</description>

      <title>Layer-selective Cooper pairing in an alternately stacked transition metal dichalcogenide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigap superconductivity emerges when superconducting gaps form on distinct Fermi surfaces. Arising from locally overlapping atomic orbitals, multiple superconducting bands introduce a new internal degree of freedom in the material that, however, escapes external control due to their coexistence in real space in the known multigap superconductors. Here, we show that the layered superconductor 4Hb-TaSSe - composed of alternating trigonal (H) and octahedral (T) polymorph layers - is a multigap superconductor, featuring two weakly coupled superconducting condensates with distinct properties, spatially separated in alternating layers. Using high-resolution quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy in the two polymorph layers, we identify two superconducting gaps that vary in size and internal structure. The intrinsic Cooper pairing in each polymorph is corroborated by the temperatures and magnetic fields at which the gaps open up, which differ in each polymorph layer and show opposing resilience to these parameters. This behavior enables selective external actuation upon the condensates. Our theoretical model based on ab-initio calculations reproduces key features of the observed superconducting gaps in the presence of finite interlayer hybridization and explains the unusually high critical field observed in the T-layer. Our results establish TMD polymorphs as platforms for engineering tunable multigap superconductors, offering new opportunities in layered superconducting device architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of high-quality 2H-TaS2 nanowires via a controlled two-step conversion process from TaS3 precursors, achieving robust superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc ~ 3.6 K which is significantly higher than bulk 2H-TaS2 (Tc ~ 0.8 K). Structural and compositional analyses confirm phase purity and preserved 1D morphology, while magnetotransport measurements reveal an enhanced upper critical field {\mu}oHc2 (2 K) ~ 5 T, far exceeding the bulk value ({\mu}oHc2 (0) ~ 1.17 T), attributed to dimensional confinement and suppression of charge density wave order. Magnetic characterization demonstrates complex vortex dynamics, including flux jumps and a second magnetization peak, indicative of strong pinning and crossover from elastic to plastic vortex regimes. These findings establish TaS2 nanowires as a versatile platform for studying superconductivity in reduced dimensions and exploiting confinement-driven quantum phenomena for advanced applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The R$_5$Pb$_3$O family was discovered decades ago, but has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report single crystal growth and basic characterization for the La and Ce members of this family. At room temperature, these compounds adopt a tetragonal structure (I4/mcm), where R and Pb atoms form linear chains along the c-axis. We identify a second-order structural phase transition at 260 K and 145 K for R = La and Ce, respectively. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a lattice modulation below the transition temperature, resulting in R-Pb pairs in the z direction. The broken symmetry in the low-temperature phases results in a primitive structure with space group P4/ncc. Transport and diffraction measurements, in agreement with density functional theory calculations, support that the R$_5$Pb$_3$O (R = La and Ce) series hosts an electron-phonon coupling driven charge density wave (CDW) at low temperatures. The CDW ordering temperature is suppressed by more than 100 K by the La to Ce substitution, suggesting high pressure-sensitivity. Therefore, this family offers the potential for investigating competing orders in oxides, with heavier rare-earth members still to be explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) play a wide variety of roles in biochemical processes that are common to all domains of life on earth. The hyperfine structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows how the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our extended approach has the potential to be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism and the finite-time scaling provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. Here we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. We find that despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the finite-time scaling form. This leads us to propose a criterion for the validity of Kibble-Zurek mechanism with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results generalize the Kibble-Zurek theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Our work not only brings fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides an approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.</description>

Abstract: The identification of quantum spin liquid phases in Kitaev candidate materials remains a major experimental challenge. Since most Kitaev candidates develop antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures, currently there are great interest on the field-induced magnetic disordered phase in these compounds, that are distinct from (partially) polarized states. Recently, a cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has emerged as a promising Kitaev candidate with high-spin $t^{5}_{2g}e^2_g$ configuration and spin-orbit entangled $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ honeycomb lattice system. There are intensive studies on field-induced magnetic states and phase transitions under in-plane magnetic fields. In this study, we identify an intermediate disordered phase induced by an out-of-plane field along the $c$-axis, through high-field magnetization and magnetocaloric effect measurements. To explain the high-field behavior of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, we develop an effective $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma^{\prime}$ spin model featuring a dominant AFM Kitaev interaction. This framework uncovers an intermediate quantum spin liquid phase, establishing the material as a unique platform for exploring Kitaev physics and field-induced quantum-disordered states.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing electronic phases of matter using photonic correlation functions</title>

Abstract: In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the correlation functions of scattered photons. We construct a mapping from the correlators of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling. We show that frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. We find that if the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, a photon-pair correlation function, i.e., $G^{(2)}$, can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. Moreover, we show that correlations between electromagnetic quadratures can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. More generally, we show that a series of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.</description>

      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in 1D Hubbard model: Drude weights and Seebeck effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Drude weight (DW) is an essential quantity that characterizes the quantum transport properties of many-body systems. However, a rigorous understanding and exact computation of DWs, particularly for strongly correlated systems with doping, still remain elusive.
  In this Letter, taking advantage of the quantum integrability, we calculate exactly the DWs and Seebeck effect (SE) for generic filling factor in one-dimensional (1D) Fermi-Hubbard model with arbitrary interaction strengths and magnetic fields. We build up its intrinsic connection to the Luttinger parameters, and derive universal scaling laws for DWs across phase transitions. Our results provide a deep understanding of mutual influences in transport between the spin and the charge degrees of freedom, showing a counterintuitive subtle spin-charge coupling effect and uncovering the microscopic origin of the (spin) Seebeck effects in thermal conductivity. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol to measure the DWs in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Gauging non-invertible symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general prescription for gauging finite non-invertible symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. Our primary example is the Rep(D$_8$) fusion category generated by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation, which is the simplest anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry on a spin chain of qubits. We explicitly compute its lattice F-symbols and illustrate our prescription for a particular (non-maximal) gauging of this symmetry. In our gauging procedure, we introduce two qubits around each link, playing the role of "gauge fields" for the non-invertible symmetry, and impose novel Gauss's laws. Similar to the Kramers-Wannier transformation for gauging an ordinary $\mathbb{Z}_2$, our gauging can be summarized by a gauging map, which is part of a larger, continuous non-invertible cosine symmetry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate in close chains throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique in close chains. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Intertwined Density Waves in La$_4$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_x$O$_{10+\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ has been reported to emerge upon suppression of intertwined spin and charge density wave (SDW/CDW) order, suggesting a possible connection to the pairing mechanism. Here we report a systematic investigation of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3-x}$Cu$_{x}$O$_{10+\delta}$ ($0 \leq x \leq 0.7$), focusing on the evolution of the SDW/CDW order as a function of chemical substitution. Temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall effect measurements reveal a linear suppression of density wave transition temperature $T{\text{dw}}$ and a concurrent enhancement of hole concentration with increasing Cu content. At higher substitution levels ($x &gt; 0.15$), the transition-induced anomaly in the resistivity becomes undetectable while a magnetic signature persists, indicating a partial decoupling of spin and charge components and the possible survival of short-range spin correlations. The absence of superconductivity across the substitution series highlights the importance of additional factors in stabilizing the superconducting state in pressurized La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Hidden Relaxation Term in Approximate Treatments of Responses to Electric and Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently a generalization of the ``\textit{modern theory of orbital magnetization}'' to include non-local Hamiltonians (e.g. hybrid functionals of the generalized Kohn-Sham theory) was provided for magnetic response properties. Results indicated inequivalence between sampling of direct and reciprocal spaces for those calculations far from the complete basis set limit. We show that this can be explained by a hidden ``relaxation'' contribution to the reciprocal-space derivatives. The missing relaxation term is shown to (generally) affect the results of calculations of not only magnetic, but also electric response properties, within the context of the ``\textit{modern theory of polarization}''. Necessary conditions are provided to permit avoiding the calculation of the hidden relaxation term.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Quantum Phases in Open Systems: Steady State of Imaginary-Time Lindbladian Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the concept of quantum phases in open quantum systems, examining the shortcomings of existing approaches that focus on steady states of Lindbladians and highlighting their limitations in capturing key phase transitions. In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new approach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum properties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition to all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian at any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated through explicit construction. Moreover, the closing of the imaginary Liouville gap is associated with the divergence of the Markov length, which has recently been proposed as an indicator of phase transitions in open quantum systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or spontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems. In contrast, we find that the steady states of real-time Lindbladians do not provide an effective framework for characterizing phase transitions in open systems.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of a number-conserving atomic Majorana phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely discussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical lattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a symmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate (artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg ladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the topological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal asymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to the critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization techniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number conservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat counterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a controlled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified by unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly building up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the proposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in atomic quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We compute various averages over bulk geometries of quantum states prepared by the Chern-Simons path integral, for any level $k$ and compact simple gauge group $G$. We do so by carefully summing over all topologically distinct bulk geometries which have $n$ disjoint boundary tori and a decomposition into space$\times$time of fixed spatial topology. We find that to leading order in the complexity of the state, the typical state contains many types of multiparty entanglement, proving a conjecture of Balasubramanian et al. Additionally, we compute an averaged wave function which captures the leading order statistics of boundary observables in the $n$ torus Chern-Simons Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-induced nonlocal transport in the topological semimetal ZrTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal transport, which goes beyond the Ohm's law, can be a key in understanding systems with topological order or edge states. Here we report an unusual nonlocal charge transport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ that occurs in the ultra-quantum limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the observed decay length of the nonlocality exceeds 100 $\mu$m and it increases linearly with the sample width. This nonlocal transport is detected not only in the longitudinal configuration, but also in the transverse one as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Our findings demonstrate that the nonlocal response can offer unprecedented insights into topological quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r$^2$SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r$^2$SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r$^2$SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX uses different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r$^2$SCANY@r$^2$SCANX enhances the r$^2$SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+$U$. The O$_2$ overbinding in r$^2$SCAN (~0.3 eV/O$_2$) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN50, minimizing r$^2$SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r$^2$SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r$^2$SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r$^2$SCAN10@r$^2$SCAN, which is 12 to 165x faster than r$^2$SCAN10</description>

      <title>Anyon-trions in atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state, forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a direct optical observation of anyon-trions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantum Fisher and Wigner-Yanase skew information following a noisy quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</description>
