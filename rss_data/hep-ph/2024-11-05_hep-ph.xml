      <title>Exploring vector dark matter via effective interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the properties of self-conjugate dark matter (DM) particles that predominantly interact with Standard Model electroweak gauge bosons, using an effective field theory approach. The study emphasizes effective contact interactions, invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, between vector DM and SM-neutral electroweak gauge bosons. Focusing on interaction terms up to dimension-8, we establish constraints on the model parameters based on the observed DM relic density and indirect detection signals. We also examine the prospects for dark matter-nucleon scattering in direct detection experiments. In addition, we analyze the sensitivity of low-energy LEP data to the pair production of light DM particles (with masses up to 80 GeV). Finally, we assess the potential of the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) to probe these effective operators through the detection of DM particles produced in association with mono-photons.</description>

      <title>New physics decaying into metastable particles: impact on cosmic neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate decays of hypothetical unstable new physics particles into metastable species such as muons, pions, or kaons in the early Universe, when temperatures are in the MeV range, and study how they affect cosmic neutrinos. We demonstrate that decays of the metastable particles compete with their annihilations and interactions with nucleons, which reduces the production of high-energy neutrinos and increases energy injection into the electromagnetic sector. This energy reallocation alters the impact of the new physics particles on the effective number of neutrino degrees of freedom, $N_{\text{eff}}$, modifies neutrino spectral distortions, and may induce asymmetries in neutrino and antineutrino energy distributions. These modifications have important implications for observables such as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background, especially in light of upcoming CMB observations aiming to reach percent-level precision on $N_{\rm eff}$. We illustrate our findings with a few examples of new physics particles and provide a computational tool available for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Zero-bias new particle searches using autoencoders in UPCs and diffractive events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of unsupervised learning for zero-bias detection of rare particle decays and exotic hadrons in low-background environments such as those characteristic of diffractive events and ultraperipheral pp, p--A, or A--A collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), or in e--A collisions at the ePIC experiment at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Using a toy dataset simulating the decays of known resonances, including $\ensuremath{{\mathrm J}/\psi}\xspace$ and {\ensuremath{\psi'}\xspace}, as well as more exotic candidates, we implement an autoencoder neural network to identify anomalies in the decay kinematics. The autoencoder, trained solely on typical events, is designed to reconstruct normal decays with low error while flagging anomalous decays based on the reconstruction error. We demonstrate that the autoencoder successfully separates typical decays from rare exotic events, with peaks in the invariant mass distribution corresponding to the injected rare signals. Our method shows promise in detecting rare, unpredicted processes in large-scale collider data, offering an effective approach for discovering new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Exploring New Physics in transition $b\to s\,\ell^+\ell^-$ through different $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the intriguing discrepancies observed in the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ neutral current decays, we study the decay channel $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=\mu,\tau$), which is also the same flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) transition at the quark level. In this context, looking for the potential of physics beyond the standard model (SM) can offer compelling results to the decay $B_c\to D_s^{(\ast)} \,\ell^+\ell^-$. For this purpose, we use the helicity formalism for this decay by employing the effective theory approach where the vector and axial vector new physics (NP) operators are present. In this study, we have calculated several observables, such as the branching ratio $B_r$, the $D^\ast$ helicity fraction $f_L$, the lepton forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$, and the lepton flavor universality ratio (LFU) $R^{\tau\mu}_{D_s^*}$. In addition, to a complimentary check on the LFU, we also calculate the ratio of different observables $R_{i}^{\tau\mu}$ where $i=A_{FB}$, $f_L$. We assume that the NP universal coupling is present for both muons and tauons, while the non-universal coupling is only present for muons. Regarding these couplings, we imply the latest global fit to the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data, which is recently computed in \cite{Alguero:2023jeh}. We give predictions of some of the mentioned observables within the SM and the various NP scenarios. We found that the considered observables are not only sensitive to the NP but also helpful in distinguishing among the different NP scenarios. These results can be tested at LHCb, HL-LHC, and FCC-ee, and therefore, the precise measurements of these observables not only deepen our understanding of the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ process but also provide a complementary check of the status of different NP scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of metastable Standard Model particles from long-lived particle decays in the MeV primordial plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: e investigate the cosmological impact of hypothetical unstable new physics particles that decay in the MeV-scale plasma of the Early Universe. Focusing on scenarios where the decays produce metastable species such as muons, pions, and kaons, we systematically analyze the dynamics of these particles using coupled Boltzmann equations governing their abundances. Our results demonstrate that the metastable species can efficiently annihilate or interact with nucleons, which often leads to their disappearance prior to decay. The suppression of decay significantly alters the properties of cosmic neutrinos, impacting cosmological observables like Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. To support further studies, we provide a public Mathematica code that traces the evolution of these metastable particles and apply it to several new physics models.</description>

      <title>Collider-Flavour Complementarity from the bottom to the top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recently observed anomalies in the flavour sector, we analyse the potential of measurements of top quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to provide complementary constraints on interactions that shape low-energy precision investigations in the $B$ sector. The measurement of top quark properties, such as the top width and the abundant top pair production channels, are already reaching the percent level at this relatively early stage of the LHC phenomenology program. A targeted analysis of four-fermion interactions employing effective field theory and RGE effects connecting $B$ scales with representative top measurements shows that the LHC is becoming competitive with and complementary to flavour physics constraints. Our results indicate that the LHC top physics program will provide a complementary tool in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model in the flavour sector.</description>

      <title>Profile Likelihoods on ML-Steroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Profile likelihoods, for instance, describing global SMEFT analyses at the LHC are numerically expensive to construct and evaluate. Especially profiled likelihoods are notoriously unstable and noisy. We show how modern numerical tools, similar to neural importance sampling, lead to a huge numerical improvement and allow us to evaluate the complete SFitter SMEFT likelihood in five hours on a single GPU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the impact of CP-violating Higgs and top interactions on diboson production from gluon fusion within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework. We systematically study differential distributions for double Higgs, double $W$ and $Z$ production and compare their features to those obtained from CP-conserving interactions. For electroweak gauge boson production, we explore the impact of the new interactions on the angular distributions of the leptonic decay products and the associated gauge boson polarisation fractions both inclusively and differentially with the transverse momentum of the gauge boson.</description>

      <title>Compact objects and dark matter dynamics in astroparticle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quark star is such an exotic star of our Universe. The limiting mass for quark stars essentially depends on rotational frequency apart from bag constant and other fundamental parameters. The analytical results obtained agree with the results of several relevant numerical estimates as well as observational evidence. Primordial black hole (PBH) is another hypothetical candidate of compact astrophysical objects. We explore the combined effect of PBH evaporation and the baryon-dark matter (DM) interaction in the 21cm scenario. We address both upper and lower bounds on several PBH and DM parameters using the observational excess (-500^{+200}_{-500} mK) of EDGES's experimental results. A similar investigation has been carried out in the framework of interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We consider three IDE models and eventually measure the allowed limits of IDE coupling parameters for individual cases. Keeping in view of the 21cm scenario, we also explore the multimessenger signals from possible rare decay of fundamental Heavy Dark Matters (HDM). HDM can undergo QCD cascade decay to produce leptons or $\gamma$ as end products. One of the multimessenger signals could be the source of ultra high energy neutrino ($\sim$PeV) signals at the IceCube detector whereas the other signal attributes to the cooling/heating of the baryons due to HDM decay and corresponding influences in the global 21cm signal. The consequence of late time decay of such HDMs may also have significant implications on the aspect of matter-antimatter asymmetry. The mass and lifetime of such Dark Matter particles have been obtained by performing a $\chi^2$ analysis with the PeV neutrino data of IceCube and finally, the amount of baryon asymmetry produced in the Universe is estimated if caused by Dark Matter decay.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence between mass eigenstates of a neutrino cannot be destroyed by its mass-momentum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the latest of a series of papers (arXiv:2410.21850), it has been claimed that neutrinos cannot oscillate as a consequence of their mass mixing. I clarify that this arises from the unrealistic assumption that neutrinos will always be in nearly exact eigenstates of energy, and ignoring the spatial dependence of the neutrino wave function. Taking into account the latter, neutrinos will be observed to oscillate in precisely the expected manner.</description>

      <title>Estimate of virtual photon polarization due to the intense magnetic field in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first numerical calculation of the virtual photon polarization and assess the feasibility of measuring the polarization via the anisotropic decay $\gamma^{*} \rightarrow \mu\mu$ using the LHC-ALICE detector. In presence of intense magnetic fields generated in high-energy non-central heavy-ion collisions that exceed the critical magnetic field intensity of quantum electrodynamics (QED), prompt virtual photons are predicted to decay anisotropically into lepton pairs, which we call virtual photon polarization. Using a relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics model, we computed the time evolution of the magnetic field and used these results to estimate the averaged polarization by calculating the vacuum polarization under the influence of the magnetic field at specific times. The estimated polarization deviates from zero with a statistical significance of $0.07\sigma$ with the data statistics collected from 2010 to 2011 and $0.15\sigma$ with the one from 2015 to 2018. It is understandable that the magnetic field could not be detected through polarization due to low statistical significance. With the data collecting the ongoing ALICE run from 2023 to 2026, the statistics dramatically increase by the upgraded LHC and the new data processing system. Thereby we expect that the statistical significance could reach $\sim 1.7\sigma$, resulting in a promising probe for detecting the intense magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional calculations of positron creation in supercritical collisions of heavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy--angle differential and total probabilities of positron creation in slow supercritical collisions of two identical heavy nuclei are calculated beyond the monopole approximation. The time-dependent Dirac equation (TDDE) for positrons is solved using the generalized pseudospectral method in modified prolate spheroidal coordinates, which are well-suited for description of close collisions in two-center quantum systems. In the frame of reference where the quasimolecular axis is fixed, the rotational coupling term is added to the Hamiltonian. Unlike our previous calculations, we do not discard this term and retain it when solving the TDDE. Both three-dimensional angle-resolved and angle-integrated energy distributions of outgoing positrons are obtained. Three-dimensional angle-resolved distributions exhibit a high degree of isotropy. For the collision energies in the interval 6 to 8 MeV/u, the influence of the rotational coupling on the distributions and total positron creation probabilities is quite small.</description>

      <title>Short- vs Long-Distance Dynamics in $b \rightarrow s\bar{\ell} \ell$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tension of $B\to K^{(*)}\bar\ell\ell$ decays with the Standard Model (SM) can be attributed to a short-distance (SD) $b s\bar\ell\ell$ interaction. We show two methods to disentangle this effect from long-distance (LD) dynamics. Firstly, we perform a comparison of the inclusive $b\to s\bar\ell\ell$ rate at high $q^2=m^2_{\ell\ell}\geq 15~\rm GeV^2$ with a determination based on data on the leading exclusive modes, finding a $\sim 2\sigma$ discrepancy. Secondly, we analyze the exclusive $B\to K^{(*)}\bar\ell\ell$ spectrum in the entire $q^2$ region. With a dispersive parametrization of the charmonia resonances, we extract the non-SM contribution to the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ for every bin in $q^2$. The result is compatible with the SD hypothesis and the inclusive determination. Finally, with the aim of having better control over LD effects that mimic the $C_9$ contribution, we estimate the size of a few charm-rescattering processes in $B\to K\bar\ell\ell$.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos in the flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino oscillation experiments provide definitive evidence of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), and the neutrino mass-squared differences and flavor mixing have been precisely measured. This study examines the neutrino sector within the flavor-dependent $U(1)_F$ model, where the unique fermion sector can simultaneously address both the flavor mixing puzzle and the mass hierarchy puzzle. It is found that the lightest neutrino is naturally massless in this model, and the predicted neutrino mass-squared differences, flavor mixing angles, Dirac CP phase agree well with the experimental measurements. Additionally, the effects of the Dirac CP phase and Majorana CP phase on the theoretical predictions of the neutrino transition magnetic dipole moments are analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the SU(3) symmetry breaking effect, the axial-vector kaons $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$ are established to be mixtures of two P-wave $K_{1A}\left( {^3{P_1}} \right)$ and $K_{1B}\left( {^1{P_1}} \right)$ states. In QCD sum rules, we propose a new construction of the $K_1$ current operators and calculate the two-point correlation functions by including the next-to-leading order four-quark condensates. The mixing angle is determined as $\theta = \left( {46.95_{ - 0.23}^{ + 0.25}} \right)^\circ$ by reproducing the masses of $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$. We further compose the $K\bar K_1\left( {1270} \right)$ and $K\bar K_1\left( {1400} \right)$ interpolating currents with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ to investigate the possible molecular interpretation of the recently observed ${\eta _1}(1855)$ state. We calculate the correlation functions and perform the QCD sum rule analyses for these two molecular systems. However, the spectral functions are found to be negative in physical regions so that they are not able to provide reliable investigations of the $K\bar K_1$ molecular states.</description>

      <title>Production and decay of anticharmed pentaquark state with quark content $\bar{c}sudd$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used an effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the production of the anticharmed pentaquark state $P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-}$ with the minimal quark content $\bar{c}sudd$ in the $\Lambda_b^0$ decay and its decay into the $\Lambda D^{(\ast)-}$ and $\Sigma D^{(\ast)-}$. In our calculation, the $P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-}$ is considered as the molecule state of the $nD_{s0(s1)}^{-}$ in an $S$ wave, and its production and decay occur via triangle loops at the hadron level. The predicted branching fractions for the processes $\Lambda_b^0\to P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-} D^+ $ are around $10^{-4}\sim 10^{-3}$. The partial decay widths of the $ P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-} \to \Lambda D^{(\ast)-}$ are between $0.1$ and $3~\mathrm{MeV}$, whereas the decay widths of the $ P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-} \to \Sigma D^{(\ast)-}$ are about one order of magnitude smaller. It is found that the width ratios for the $P_{\bar{c}s}^{(*)-}$ decays are nearly independent of the model parameter $\alpha$. It is hoped that these predictions could be helpful to search for the anticharmed-strange pentaquark candidates in the future LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Bayesian parameter estimation by adapting to multiple energy scales in RHIC and LHC heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved constraints on current model parameters in a heavy-ion collision model are established using the latest measurements from three distinct collision systems. Various observables are utilized from Au--Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV and Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$~TeV and $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=2.76$~TeV. Additionally, the calibration of centrality is now carried out separately for all parametrizations. The inclusion of an Au--Au collision system with an order of magnitude lower beam energy, along with separate centrality calibration, suggests a preference for smaller values of nucleon width, minimum volume per nucleon, and free-streaming time. The results with the acquired \textit{maximum a posteriori} parameters show improved agreement with the data for the second-order flow coefficient, identified particle yields, and mean transverse momenta. This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of heavy-ion collision dynamics and sets the stage for future improvements in theoretical modeling and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Line shape of the $J\psi \to \gamma \eta_{c}$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate description of the photon spectrum line shape is essential for extracting resonance parameters of the $\eta_c$ meson through the radiative transition $J/\psi \to \gamma \eta_{c}$. However, a persistent challenge remains in the form of a divergent tail at high photon energies, arising from the $E_{\gamma}^3$ factor in theoretical calculations. Various damping functions have been proposed to mitigate this effect in practical experiments, but their empirical nature lacks a rigorous theoretical basis. In this study, we introduce two key considerations: incorporating full-order contributions of the Bessel function in the overlap integral of charmonium wave functions and the phase space factor neglected in previous experimental studies. By accounting for these factors, we demonstrate a more rational and effective damping function of the divergent tail associated with the $E_{\gamma}^3$ term. We present the implications of these findings on experimental measurements and provide further insights through toy Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derived the BK equation for quark-quark scattering, extending the dipole-hadron scattering framework. This derivation reveals that the quark-quark scattering amplitude grows with increasing quark rapidity. Since the momentum dot product is Lorentz invariant, the coupling constant plays a crucial role in accounting for it.</description>

      <title>A minimalistic model for inelastic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of inelastic (or pseudo-Dirac) dark matter commonly introduce a gauge symmetry spontaneously broken by the introduction of a dark sector version of the Higgs mechanism. We find that this ubiquitous introduction of two extra fields, a vector and complex scalar boson, is indeed unnecessary, with only a mass generating real scalar field being actually required. We consider a simple UV-complete model realizing this minimal setup and study the decays of the excited dark matter state as well as constraints from perturbative unitarity, (in)direct detection and colliders. We find that, in the visible freeze-out scenario ($ \text{DM} \, \text{DM} \leftrightarrow \text{SM} \, \text{SM} $), we still have unconstrained regions of parameter space for dark matter masses $\gtrsim 100$ GeV. Moreover, most of the available regions either present long-lived excited states, which are expected to interfere with the standard cosmological history, or will be probed by future direct detection experiments, such as DARWIN, due to the unavoidable residual elastic interactions. The only regions remaining out of experimental reach present highly fine-tuned parameters.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks viewpoint for solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve fundamental Dyson-Schwinger integral equations in the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Euclidean space. Our approach uses neural networks to approximate the fermion wave function renormalization, dynamical mass function, and photon propagator. By integrating the Dyson-Schwinger equations into the loss function, the networks learn and predict solutions over a range of momenta and ultraviolet cutoff values. This method can be extended to other quantum field theories (QFTs), potentially paving the way for forefront applications of machine learning within high-level theoretical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an autodifferentiable rejection sampling algorithm termed Rejection Sampling with Autodifferentiation (RSA). In conjunction with reweighting, we show that RSA can be used for efficient parameter estimation and model exploration. Additionally, this approach facilitates the use of unbinned machine-learning-based observables, allowing for more precise, data-driven fits. To showcase these capabilities, we apply an RSA-based parameter fit to a simplified hadronization model.</description>

      <title>NLO QCD predictions for $\boldsymbol{t\bar{t}\gamma}$ with realistic photon isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete description of top quark pair production in association with a hard photon in the di-lepton decay channel. The calculation is performed at NLO QCD and includes all resonant and non-resonant Feynman diagrams, interferences, and finite-width effects of the top quarks and $W^\pm/Z$ gauge bosons. We provide the results for the $pp\to e^+\nu_e \,\mu^- \bar{\nu}\, b\bar{b}\,\gamma+X$ process using the fixed-cone, smooth-cone and hybrid-photon isolation criteria. The fixed-cone isolation criterion allows contributions from collinear photon radiation off QCD partons, which requires the inclusion of parton-to-photon fragmention processes. To this end, we include the latter contributions into our computational framework. We quantify the impact of different photon-isolation prescriptions on the integrated and differential cross-section predictions for the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. Our state-of-the-art NLO QCD results with the fixed-cone criterion allow us to reproduce the photon-isolation prescription employed in ATLAS and CMS. This will help to improve future comparisons with the LHC data.</description>

      <title>Radially excited pion: electromagnetic form factor and the box contribution to the muon's $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the radially excited charged pion, with a specific focus on its electromagnetic form factor (EFF) and its box contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) component of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_{\mu}$. Utilizing a coupled non-perturbative framework combining Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, we first compute the mass and weak decay constant of the pion's first radial excitation. Initial results are provided for the Rainbow-Ladder (RL) approximation, followed by an extended beyond RL (BRL) analysis that incorporates meson cloud effects. Building on our previous work, this analysis demonstrates that an accurate description of the first radial excitation can be achieved without the need for a reparametrization of the interaction kernels. Having demonstrated the effectiveness of the truncation scheme, we proceed to calculate the corresponding EFF, from which we derive the contribution of the pion's first radial excitation to the HLbL component of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, producing $a_{\mu}^{\pi_1-\text{box}}(\text{RL}) = -(2.03 \pm 0.12) \times 10 ^{-13}$, $a_{\mu}^{\pi_1-\text{box}}(\text{BRL}) = -(2.02 \pm 0.10) \times 10 ^{-13}$. Our computation also sets the groundwork for calculating related pole contributions of excited pseudoscalar mesons to $a_{\mu}$.</description>

      <title>New Tool to Detect Inhomogeneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we discuss a novel method to search for inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in theories with fermions. The prime application we have in mind is QCD, but the method is also applicable for other theories including solid state applications. It is based on an extension of the chiral susceptibility to inhomogeneous phases and it works as a stability analysis. Our method allows us to determine when homogeneous solutions have the tendency to create spatially modulated condensates. As proof of principle, we apply this technique to a rainbow-ladder QCD model and confirm the conjectured shape of the instability region published in Ref. [1].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the decay process $\Lambda_b \to \Sigma_c^{++} D^- K^-$ with the objective of finding a predicted molecular state with isospin $I=1$, $J^P=2^+$ of $D^* K^*$ nature, plus finding support for the $P_c(4312)$ state as made out of $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$. The mass distribution of the $D^- K^-$ system shows distinct features as a consequence of the existing of this $2^+$ state, while the $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$ distribution exhibits a significant peak near the threshold, much bigger than phase space expectations, which is linked to our assumed $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$ nature of the $P_c(4312)$ state below the $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$ threshold. The reaction has been measured at LHCb Collaboration, but only the branching ratio is measured. The present study shows that much valuable information can be obtained about the predicted $2^+$ $T_{c\bar{s}}(2834)$ of $D^* K^*$ nature and the $P_c(4312)$ states from the measurements of the mass distributions in this reaction, which will be accessible in the planned updates of LHCb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic approaches to modeling relativistic high-energy heavy-ion collisions are based on the conservation of energy and momentum. However, the medium formed in these collisions also carries additional conserved quantities, including baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). In this Letter, we propose a new set of anisotropic flow observables designed to be exclusively sensitive to the effects of conserved BSQ charge fluctuations, providing insight into the initial state. Using the recently developed hydrodynamic framework \iccing{}+\ccake{}, we show that these new observables provide a measurable effect of initial BSQ charge fluctuations (ranging up to $\sim $10\%), which can be tested by experiments.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic state preparation for digital quantum simulations of QED in 1 + 1D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1D (QED2) shares intriguing properties with QCD, including confinement, string breaking, and interesting phase diagram when the non-trivial topological $\theta$-term is considered. Its lattice regularization is a commonly used toy model for quantum simulations of gauge theories on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we address algorithms for adiabatic state preparation in digital quantum simulations of QED2. We demonstrate that, for specific choices of parameters, the existing adiabatic procedure leads to level crossing between states of different charge sectors, preventing the correct preparation of the ground state. We further propose a new adiabatic Hamiltonian and verify its efficiency in targeting systems with a nonzero topological $\theta$-term and in studying string breaking phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark jet provides one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to the hot quark-gluon plasma. In this proceeding paper, we review a series of works on the development of nonperturbative computational framework of in-medium quark jet evolution, from classical to quantum simulation. The application of the time-dependent Basis Light-front Quantization (tBLFQ), a nonperturbative computational approach based on light-front Hamiltonian formalism, to in-medium jet evolution enables a fully quantum treatment to the jet state on the amplitude level. Based on the tBLFQ framework, with applying novel quantum technologies, we have constructed a digital quantum circuit that tracks the evolution of a multi-particle jet probe within a stochastic color background field. With the obtained simulation results, we extracted the medium induced modification in terms of jet momentum broadening and gluon production. These studies provide a baseline for future works of in-medium jet evolution using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study first- and second-order electromagnetic perturbations in Schwarzschild spacetime, deriving effective source terms for the second-order Regge-Wheeler equation, which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations, in parallel with results from [1]. In addition to the induced mixed-quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies $\omega^{(1)} = i \frac{V_G}{2}$ and $\Omega^{(1)} = i \frac{V_{EM}}{2}$, resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at $\Omega^{(2)} = -i \frac{V_{EM} + V_G}{2}$. This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. For the first-order perturbations, we reduce the perturbation of a point charge source to a one-dimensional path integral. Using the Dirac delta approximation, we investigated the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge $q$ and radial dipole moment $p = q \eta$, employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Finally, we comment on the limitations of the Dirac delta approximation used in this analysis. This approach overlooks centrifugal effects,subsequently fail to recover the minkowski limit, resulting in an unrealistic spatial behavior. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Higgs Self-coupling Strategy at Linear e$^+$e$^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the Higgs self-coupling is a key target for future colliders, in particular through di-Higgs production at $e^+e^-$ Linear Colliders with $\sqrt{s} &gt; 450$\,GeV, e.g.\ ILC, C3 or CLIC. This contribution will discuss the roles and the interplay of di-Higgs production processes at various collider energies, including the case of non-SM values of the self-coupling. Previous studies, already based on Geant4-based detector simulation, established that the Higgs self-coupling can be extracted with $10-27\%$ precision and provided a solid understanding of the limiting factors. This provides a robust starting point to explore the potential of more modern and sophisticated reconstruction and analysis techniques. We summarize the impact of advanced, often machine-learning-based algorithms, including e.g.\ jet clustering, kinematic fitting and matrix element-inferred likelihoods on the reconstruction of $ZHH$ events and before discussing the dependence of the projected precision on the center-of-mass energy and on the actual value of the self-coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rationale-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Jet Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of 77.53% while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</description>

      <title>The role of intermediate $\Delta\Delta$ states in nucleon-nucleon scattering in the large-$N_c$ and unitary limits, and $\Delta\Delta$ and $\Omega\Omega$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore potential explanations for why using large-$N_c$ ($N_c$ is the number of colors) scaling to determine the relative size of few-nucleon low-energy operators agrees with experiment even when dynamical $\Delta$'s are not explicitly included. Given that the large-$N_c$ analysis is predicated on the nucleons and $\Delta$'s being degenerate, this is a curious result. We show that for purely $S$-wave interactions the relationships dictated by large-$N_c$ scaling are unaffected whether the $\Delta$ is included or not. In the case of higher partial waves that do not mix with $S$-waves, the impact of the $\Delta$ is perturbative, which makes the agreement with naive ($\Delta$-less) large-$N_c$ ordering unsurprising. For higher partial waves that mix with $S$-waves, the nucleon and $\Delta$ would need to decouple to get agreement with naive large-$N_c$ ordering. We find all $NN$, $\Delta N$, and $\Delta\Delta$ low energy coefficients for leading-order baryon-baryon scattering in $\Delta$-full pionless effective field theory in terms of the two independent parameters dictated by the SU($2F$) spin-flavor symmetry that arises in the $N_c \rightarrow \infty$ limit. Because of recent lattice QCD results and experimental interest, we extend our analysis to the three-flavor case to study $\Omega\Omega$ scattering. We show that in the unitary limit (where scattering lengths become infinite) one of the two SU($2F$) parameters is driven to zero, resulting in enhanced symmetries, which agree with those found in spin-1/2 entanglement studies.</description>

      <title>Proton decay in de Sitter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. The demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The lesson for the Unruh effect is discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>

      <title>Strong parity-violation effects induced by large-amplitude motions: A quantum-dynamics study of substituted chiral methanols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.1 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <title>Diamagnetic micro-chip traps for levitated nanoparticle entanglement experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Gravity Mediated Entanglement (QGEM) protocol offers a novel method to probe the quantumness of gravitational interactions at non-relativistic scales. This protocol leverages the Stern-Gerlach effect to create $\mathcal{O}(\sim \mu m)$ spatial superpositions of two nanodiamonds (mass $\sim 10^{-15}$ kg) with NV spins, which are then allowed to interact and become entangled solely through the gravitational interaction. Since electromagnetic interactions such as Casimir-Polder and dipole-dipole interactions dominate at this scale, screening them to ensure the masses interact exclusively via gravity is crucial. In this paper, we propose using magnetic traps based on micro-fabricated wires, which provide strong gradients with relatively modest magnetic fields to trap nanoparticles for interferometric entanglement experiments. The design consists of a small trap to cool the center-of-mass motion of the nanodiamonds and a long trap with a weak direction suitable for creating macroscopic superpositions. In contrast to permanent-magnet-based long traps, the micro-fabricated wire-based approach allows fast switching of the magnetic trapping and state manipulation potentials and permits integrated superconducting shielding, which can screen both electrostatic and magnetic interactions between nanodiamonds in a gravitational entanglement experiment. The setup also provides a possible platform for other tests of quantum coherence in macroscopic systems and searches for novel short-range forces.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Resonant and Broadband Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter and High-Frequency Gravitational Waves via Cavities and Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic resonant systems, such as cavities and LC circuits, are widely used to detect ultralight boson dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves. However, the narrow bandwidth of single-mode resonators necessitates multiple scan steps to cover broad frequency ranges. By incorporating a network of auxiliary modes via beam-splitter-type and non-degenerate parametric couplings, we enable broadband detection with an effective bandwidth of each scan matching the order of the resonant frequency, while maintaining a strong signal response. In heterodyne upconversion detection, where a background cavity mode transitions into another due to a potential background source, multiple orders of the source frequency can be probed with high sensitivity without tuning the cavity frequency. Consequently, our method allows for significantly deeper exploration of the parameter space within the same integration time compared to single-mode detection.</description>

      <title>Dark matter scattering off ${}^4$He in chiral effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dark matter scattering off ${}^4$He and other light nuclei using chiral effective field theory. We consider scalar DM interactions and include both one- and two-nucleon scattering processes. The DM interactions and nuclear wave functions are obtained from chiral effective field theory and we work up to fourth order in the chiral expansion for the latter to investigate the chiral convergence. The results for the scattering rates can be used to determine the sensitivity of planned experiments to detect relatively light dark matter particles using ${}^4$He. We find that next-to-leading-order scalar currents are smaller than expected from power counting for scattering off ${}^4$He confirming earlier work. However, the results for two-nucleon corrections exhibit a linear regulator dependence indicating potential problems in the applied power counting. We observe a linear correlation between the, in principle not observable, D-wave probability of various light nuclei and the scalar two-nucleon matrix elements, again pointing towards potentially missing contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tetraquarks, bound states composed of two quarks and two antiquarks, have been the subject of intense study but are challenging to understand from first principles. We apply variational and Green's function Monte Carlo methods to compute tetraquark ground-state energies in potential nonrelativistic QCD using a wide range of color and spatial wavefunctions. We find no evidence for bound tetraquarks composed of equal-mass quarks and antiquarks. Conversely, we find clear evidence for the existence of bound tetraquarks for sufficiently unequal quark/antiquark mass ratios at all overall mass scales where our effective theory results are applicable. We predict the critical mass ratios for bound state formation and study tetraquark bound states' spatial and color structure at leading order and next-to-leading order in potential nonrelativistic QCD.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Sensitivity to Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions of NaI and Cryogenic CsI Detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) by the COHERENT collaboration, many efforts are being made to improve the measurement of this process, making it possible to constrain new physics in the neutrino sector. In this paper, we study the sensitivity to non-standard interactions (NSIs) and generalized neutrino interactions (GNIs) of two experimental setups at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory: a NaI detector with characteristics similar to the one that is currently being deployed there, and a cryogenic CsI detector proposed at the same facility. We show that a combined analysis of the data from these detectors, whose target nuclei have significantly different proton-to-neutron ratios, could help to partially break the parameter degeneracies arising from the interference between the Standard Model and NSI contributions to the CE$\nu$NS cross section, as well as between different NSI parameters. By contrast, only a slight improvement over the current CsI constraints is expected for parameters that do not interfere with the SM contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot quantum electrodynamics (QED) plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis employs the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation, calculated with full kinematics and exact amplitudes of one-to-two and two-to-one QED processes. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit an approximate scaling behavior described by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (with $T$ denoting temperature and $B$ magnetic field strength). We argue that the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter.</description>

      <title>Implications of $B \to K \nu \bar{\nu}$ under Rank-One Flavor Violation hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implications of the observed excess in $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ under the assumption of Rank-One Flavour Violation, i.e. that New Physics couples to a single specific direction in flavour space. By varying this direction we perform analyses at the level of the low-energy EFT, the SMEFT, and with explicit mediators such as leptoquarks and colorless vectors ($Z^\prime$ and $V^\prime$). We study correlations with other flavour, electroweak and collider observables, finding that the most interesting ones are with $K \to \pi \nu \bar{\nu}$, $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, meson mixing and the LHC searches in $\tau^+ \tau^-$ high-energy tails. Among the various mediators, the scalar leptoquarks $\tilde{R}_2$ and $S_1$ offer the best fits of the Belle-II excess, while being consistent with the other bounds. On the other hand, colorless vectors are strongly constrained by meson mixing and resonance searches in $p p \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. In all cases we find that a flavour alignment close to the third generation is generically preferred.</description>

      <title>CP asymmetry from the effect of the isospin symmetry breaking during B-meson decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The direct CP asymmetry in quasi-two-body decays of $B \rightarrow (V\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-})P $ is investigated in the perturbative QCD method, where P represents a pseudoscalar meson and V refers to $\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons, respectively. We present the amplitude of the quasi-two-body decay process and investigate the effects of mixed resonances involving $\rho^{0}-\omega$, $\rho^{0}-\phi$ and $\omega-\phi$, while considering the impact of isospin symmetry breaking. We observe a significant CP asymmetry when the invariant mass of the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pair is within the resonance ranges of $\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons. Consequently, we proceed to quantify the regional CP asymmetry in these resonance regions. A significant difference is observed when comparing results obtained with and without interferences of the three vector mesons and isospin conservation. The CP asymmetry results obtained from the three-body decay process, without interference due to isospin conservation by the perturbative QCD method, are in agreement with the newly updated data acquired by the LHCb experiment.</description>

Abstract: New low-mass particles with very small couplings to standard model particles that travel significant distances before decaying are interesting candidates to address some of the most intriguing questions of modern physics. In this paper, I propose to extend the LHC's research program by installing a gaseous fixed target referred to as SHIFT at around 160 meters from the CMS interaction point. When the LHC proton beam collides with this target, interactions at a center of mass energy of $\approx$113 GeV would occur. The particles produced in such collisions, or their decay products, would travel through the rock and other material on their path, potentially reaching the CMS detector where they can be registered and studied. Such an approach would allow us to access otherwise uncovered regions of parameters phase space at a relatively low cost since it does not require constructing a new detector. Various aspects such as angular and lifetime coverage or material survival probability have been studied. The results are interpreted within two new physics models, namely, the Dark Photons and the Hidden Valley scenarios, and compared with the standard proton-proton physics program of CMS. A comparison is also made with the fixed target program at LHCb, as well as parasitic detectors such as FASER or MATHUSLA. The obtained results indicate that, despite assuming just 1% of the nominal CMS luminosity to be available to SHIFT, the physics reach could be extended by a factor of up to 150 (1000) for Dark Photon (Hidden Valley) scenarios, depending on the signal model parameters.</description>

      <title>Lepton-Flavor-Violating ALP Signals with TeV-Scale Muon Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using TeV-energy muons to probe lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) processes mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) $a$ with mass $\mathcal{O}(10~\textrm{GeV})$. We focus on $\mu\tau$ LFV interactions and assume that the ALP is coupled to a dark state $\chi$, which can be either less or more massive than $a$. Such a setup is demonstrated to be consistent with $\chi$ being a candidate for dark matter, in the experimentally relevant regime of parameters. We consider the currently operating NA64-$\mu$ experiment and proposed FASER$\nu$2 detector as both the target and the detector for the process $\mu A \to \tau A\, a$, where $A$ is the target nucleus. We also show that a possible future active muon fixed-target experiment operating at a 3 TeV muon collider or in its preparatory phase can provide an impressive reach for the LFV process considered, with future FASER$\nu$2 data providing a pilot study towards that goal. The implications of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_\mu$ measurements for the underlying model, in case of a positive signal, are also examined, and a sample UV completion is outlined.</description>

      <title>Thermal pressure on ultrarelativistic bubbles from a semiclassical formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a planar bubble wall that is traveling at an ultrarelativistic speed through a thermal plasma. This situation may arise during a first-order electroweak phase transition in the early universe. As particles cross the wall, it is assumed that their mass grows from $m_a$ to $m_b$, and they are decelerated causing them to emit massless radiation ($m_c=0$). We are interested in the momentum transfer to the wall, the thermal pressure felt by the wall, and the resultant terminal velocity of the wall. We employ the semiclassical current radiation (SCR) formalism to perform these calculations. An incident-charged particle is treated as a point-like classical electromagnetic current, and the spectrum of quantum electromagnetic radiation (photons) is derived by calculating appropriate matrix elements. To understand how the spectrum depends on the thickness of the wall, we explore simplified models for the current corresponding to an abrupt and a gradual deceleration. For the model of abrupt deceleration, we find that the SCR formalism can reproduce the $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^0$ scaling found in earlier work by assuming that the emission is soft, but if the emission is not soft the SCR formalism can be used to obtain $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^2$ instead. For the model of gradual deceleration, we find that the wall thickness $L_w$ enters to cutoff the otherwise log-flat radiation spectrum above a momentum of $\sim \gamma_w^2 / L_w$, and we discuss the connections with classical electromagnetic bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the two-flavor quark-meson diquark (QMD) model as a renormalizable low-energy model for QCD in the 2SC phase of QCD. The effective degrees of freedom are the mesons (sigma and pions), quarks, and diquarks. Some of the parameters of the model can be determined by expressing them in terms of the vacuum meson masses and the pion decay constant using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are considered free, although they in principle can be calculated from QCD. The thermodynamic potential is calculated in a mean-field approximation taking only quark loops into account. In this approximation, we derive a set of renormalization group equations for the running masses and couplings. The solutions to these equations are used to improve the thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ and thereby thermodynamic quantities. Four parameter sets are chosen and the phase diagram in the $\bar{\mu}$--$T$ plane is obtained (with $\bar{\mu}={1\over3}\mu_B$). We also calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of $\bar{\mu}$ at vanishing temperature. For large values of $\bar{\mu}$, the speed of sound approaches the conformal limit $c_s={1\over\sqrt{3}}$ from above, in disagreement with perturbative calculations, but agreement with hard-dense-loop resummed perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: Sphaleron electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is calculated in two phase transition stages, thereby showing that the twin (or double) bubble nucleation structure of the phase transition and gravitational wave is in the investigation area of future detectors. With $v^2=v^2_1+v^2_2$ ($v_1$ and $v_2$ are two vacuum average values (VEV)), the parameter $\tan\beta=v_2/v_1$, is the ratio between two VEVs although it does not affect the strength of EWPT but affect the sphaleron energy. However, it only causes this energy to increase slightly. As $a=v^2/v_2^2$ increases, the maximum difference of sphaleron energy in one stage is about $6.15$ TeV. $a$ affects the expansion of bubbles during two phase transitions. The more $a$ increases, the more the expansion of two bubbles is at the same time. This ratio does not greatly affect the sphaleron energy but has an impact on gravitational waves. The larger the masses of the charged Higgs particles are, the greater the gravitational wave energy density ($\Omega h^2$) is. When the frequency is in the range $0-1.2$ mHz, $\Omega h^2$ will has a maximum value in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-11}$ for all values of $a$ so this can be detected in the future.</description>

      <title>Novel standard candle: Collapsing axion stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble constant, $H_0$, is a crucial parameter in cosmology. However, various cosmic observations have produced differing posterior values for $H_0$, resulting in what is referred to as the $H_0$ tension. To resolve this discrepancy, utilizing other cosmological probes to constrain $H_0$ is advantageous. In the quest to identify dark matter candidates, the QCD axion and axionlike particles, collectively referred to as axions, have become leading contenders. These elusive particles can coalesce into dense structures known as axion stars via Bose-Einstein condensation. When these axion stars exceed a critical mass, typically through accretion or merging, they experience a self-induced collapse. This process results in short radio bursts, assuming a decay constant $f_a\lesssim10^{13}{\rm{GeV}}$, with the frequency depending on the axion mass and the luminosity determined by both the axion mass and decay constant. Therefore, we propose that collapsing axion stars could serve as a novel standard candle to constrain $H_0$. Even more interesting is that the radio bursts emitted by collapsing axion stars with specific parameters match the characteristics of observed non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). Thus, FRBs generated by collapsing axion stars have the potential to be used as standard candles to constrain $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Sensitivity to Seesaw Predictions in Gauged $B-L$ Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New gauge bosons coupled to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are simple and well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. In searches for HNLs in proton fixed-target experiments, we find that a large population of gauge bosons ($Z^\prime$) produced by proton bremsstrahlung may decay to HNLs, leading to a significant improvement in existing bounds on the ($m_{HNL}, U_{\alpha}$), where $U_\alpha$ represent the mixing between HNL and the active neutrinos with flavor $\alpha$. We study this possibility in fixed target experiments with the 8 GeV proton beams, including SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS, as well as DUNE and DarkQuest at 120 GeV. We find the projected sensitivities to additional $Z^\prime$-mediated HNL production can bring the seesaw mechanism of the neutrino masses within a broadened experimental reach.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Analysis of Radiative Decays to Dark Matter at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for weakly interacting matter particles (WIMPs) is one of the main objectives of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). In this work we use Machine-Learning (ML) techniques to explore WIMP radiative decays into a Dark Matter (DM) candidate in a supersymmetric framework. The minimal supersymmetric WIMP sector includes the lightest neutralino that can provide the observed DM relic density through its co-annihilation with the second lightest neutralino and lightest chargino. Moreover, the direct DM detection cross section rates fulfill current experimental bounds and provide discovery targets for the same region of model parameters in which the radiative decay of the second lightest neutralino into a photon and the lightest neutralino is enhanced. This strongly motivates the search for radiatively decaying neutralinos which, however, suffers from strong backgrounds. We investigate the LHC reach in the search for these radiatively decaying particles by means of cut-based and ML methods and estimate its discovery potential in this well-motivated, new physics scenario.</description>

      <title>A Model-Independent Bound on Light Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a robust bound on dark photon dark matter scenarios where the dark photon mass is generated through the Higgs mechanism, based on the requirement that symmetry breaking must occur sufficiently early in the universe. We emphasize that dark photon production occurs successfully when the dark Higgs field remains in the symmetric phase due to non-thermal trapping effects. For renormalizable Higgs potentials, our bound reads $$\frac{m_{\gamma'}}{q_H e_H}\; \gg \;60\,{\rm eV}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^{1/4}$$ where $m_{\gamma'}$ is the dark photon mass, $e_H$ is the gauge coupling, $q_H$ is the charge of the dark Higgs boson, and $\lambda$ is the Higgs quartic coupling. This constraint holds independently of any complications arising from the Schwinger effect and vortex formation in the Higgsed phase. For more general Higgs potentials such as the Coleman-Weinberg type potential, our bound yields different forms. We argue that late-time symmetry breaking of the dark U(1) symmetry satisfying the bound has only a mild impact on both the abundance and momentum distribution of dark photon dark matter, and therefore does not pose any serious problem for the dark photon dark matter scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The determination of whether the ground state of baryon matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the ordinary nucleus or a quark matter state remains a long-standing question in physics. A critical parameter in this investigation is the bag parameter $B$, which quantifies the QCD vacuum energy and can be computed using nonperturbative methods such as Lattice QCD (LQCD). By combining the equation of state derived from perturbative QCD (pQCD) with the bag parameter to fit the LQCD-simulated data for isospin-dense matter, we address the stability of quark matter within the LQCD+pQCD framework. Our findings suggest that the current data imposes an upper bound on $B^{1/4} \lesssim 160~{\rm MeV}$, approaching a conclusive statement on quark matter stability. Given the lower bound on $B$ from the quark condensate contribution to the vacuum energy, the stable 2-flavor quark matter remains possible, whereas the stable 2+1-flavor quark matter is excluded. Additionally, we derive more general thermodynamic bounds on the quark matter energy-per-baryon and $B$, which, while weaker, provide complementary insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a light-front model of the proton to investigate the twist-3 chiral-even generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of light sea quarks. In this model, the sea quarks are treated as spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) active partons, while the remaining proton constituents are modeled as spin-1 spectators. The momentum wave function, predicted by the soft-wall AdS/QCD, is fitted to the unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) from the CETQ global analysis. Using this fitted distribution, we determine the unknown model parameters. We calculate the twist-3 GPDs and analyze their dependence on the transverse momentum transfer, \(\Delta_T^2\), and the longitudinal momentum fraction, \(x\). Additionally, we explore the Mellin moments and the twist-3 chiral-even PDF, \(g_T(x)\), within this theoretical framework.</description>

Abstract: We report on the reactions $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K} \Xi $ and $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K}\Xi^*(1530)~(\Xi^*(1530)\to \pi\Xi $), and calculate the mass distributions $\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}M_\text{inv}(\bar{K}\Xi)}$ and $\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}M_\text{inv}(\bar{K}\Xi^*)}$, respectively. We obtain clear peaks corresponding to the $\Omega(2012)$. From the decay of $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K}\Xi^*$, we also get a second, broader, peak around $2035\,\rm MeV$, which comes from the $\Omega(2012)$ decay to $\bar{K}\Xi^*$. This second peak is closely tied to the molecular picture of the $\Omega(2012)$ with the $\bar{K}\Xi^*(1530)$ and $\eta\Omega$ components. Its observation would provide a boost to the molecular picture of the $\Omega(2012)$.</description>

Abstract: The gradient-flow formalism proves to be a useful tool in lattice calculations of quantum chromodynamics. For example, it can be used as a scheme to renormalize composite operators by inverting the short-flow-time expansion of the corresponding flowed operators. In this paper, we consider the short-flow-time expansion of five quark bilinear operators, the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axialvector, and tensor currents, and compute the matching coefficients through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD. Among other applications, our results constitute one ingredient for calculating bag parameters of mesons within the gradient-flow formalism on the lattice.</description>

Abstract: Unveiling the dark sector of the Universe is one of the leading efforts in theoretical physics. Among the many models proposed, axions and axion-like particles stand out due to their solid theoretical foundation, capacity to contribute significantly to both dark matter and dark energy, and potential to address the small-scale crisis of $\Lambda$CDM. Moreover, these pseudo-scalar fields couple to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons parity-violating term, leading to a rotation of the plane of linearly polarized waves, namely cosmic birefringence. We explore the impact of the axion-parameters on anisotropic birefringence and study, for the first time, its cross-correlation with the spatial distribution of galaxies, focusing on ultralight axions with masses $10^{-33}\,{\rm eV}\le m_\phi\le10^{-28}\,{\rm eV}$. Through this novel approach, we investigate the axion-parameter space in the mass $m_\phi$ and initial misalignment angle $\theta_i$, within the framework of early dark energy models, and constrain the axion-photon coupling $g_{\phi\gamma}$ required to achieve unity in the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying cross-correlation, computed with the instrument specifications of Euclid and forthcoming CMB-polarization data. Our findings reveal that for masses below $10^{-32}\,{\rm eV}$ and initial misalignment angles greater in absolute value than $\pi/4$, the signal-to-noise ratio not only exceeds unity but also surpasses that achievable from the auto-correlation of birefringence alone (up to a factor 7), highlighting the informative potential of this new probe. Additionally, given the late-time evolution of these low-mass axions, the signal stems from the epoch of reionization, providing an excellent tool to single out the birefringence generated during this period.</description>

Abstract: Decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $D_s$, $\eta_c$ and vector mesons $D^*$, $D_s^*$, $J/\psi$ are determined from $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at a lattice spacing $a\sim0.08$ fm. For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by tensor currents are given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\overline{\rm MS},\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>Emergent electromagnetism</title>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of emergent electric field. This is distinguished from the fundamental one in that the emergent electric field directly appears in observations through the Lorentz force, while the latter enters the phase space as the canonical momentum of the electromagnetic field. In Hamiltonian classical electromagnetism this concept naturally appears after introducing the topological $\theta$ term. Furthermore, we show that in the spherically symmetric model the concept of emergent electric field allows us to formulate a modified theory of electromagnetism that is otherwise impossible. The relation between the fundamental and the emergent electric fields is derived from the imposition of general covariance of the electromagnetic strength tensor, which is a nontrivial task in the canonical formulation the modified theory is based on. We couple this theory to emergent modified gravity, where a similar distinction between spacetime and gravity is made such that the spacetime, which defines the observable geometry, is an emergent field composed of the fundamental gravitational field. In this more encompassing emergent field theory coupling gravity and electromagnetism, we show that the spherically symmetric model contains a nonsingular black hole solution where not only modified gravity but also modified electromagnetism is crucial for a robust singularity resolution and to avoid the existence of (super)extermal black holes.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>
