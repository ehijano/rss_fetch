      <title>Antagonistic coinfection in rock-paper-scissors models during concurrent epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of dual disease epidemics within the spatial rock-paper-scissors model. In this framework, individuals from all species are equally susceptible to infection by two distinct pathogens transmitted via person-to-person contact. We assume antagonistic mortality, where the simultaneous occurrence of coinfection reduces the probability of host mortality due to complications arising from either coexisting disease. Specifically, we explore two scenarios: global antagonism, where the presence of one pathogen inhibits the progression of the other in coinfected hosts, and uneven antagonism, where only one pathogen affects the development of the other. Using stochastic simulations, we show that the characteristic length scale of the spatial patterns emerging from random initial conditions diminishes as antagonism becomes more significant. We find that antagonism enhances species population growth and reduces the average probability of healthy organisms becoming infected. Additionally, introducing individuals' mobility restrictions significantly decreases both organisms' infection risk and selection pressures. Our results demonstrate that combining mobility restrictions with antagonistic coinfection can increase organisms' life expectancy by up to $54\%$. Our findings show that integrating antagonistic coinfection and mobility restriction strategies into ecological models may provide insights into designing interventions for managing concurrent epidemics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Spatially Structured Flocking in a Proliferating Population of Self-Propelled Organisms without Explicit Alignment Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is well established that self-propelled particles with alignment interactions can exhibit orientational order, the impact of self-replication and annihilation, which are key characteristics in cellular systems, on spatiotemporal order remains poorly understood. To explore the interplay between self-propulsion and self-replication, we introduce the active Brownian bug (ABB) model, in which self-propelled agents undergo stochastic, density-dependent replication and constant-rate death. Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.</description>

      <title>CVTree for 16S rRNA: Constructing Taxonomy-Compatible All-Species Living Tree Effectively and Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Composition Vector Tree (CVTree) method, developed under the leadership of Professor Hao Bailin, is an alignment-free algorithm for constructing phylogenetic trees. Although initially designed for studying prokaryotic evolution based on whole-genome, it has demonstrated broad applicability across diverse biological systems and gene sequences. In this study, we employed two methods, InterList and Hao, of CVTree to investigate the phylogeny and taxonomy of prokaryote based on the 16S rRNA sequences from All-Species Living Tree Project. We have established a comprehensive phylogenetic tree that incorporates the majority of species documented in human scientific knowledge and compared it with the taxonomy of prokaryotes. And the performance of CVTree were also compared with multiple sequence alignment-based approaches. Our results revealed that CVTree methods achieve computational speeds 1-3 orders of magnitude faster than conventional alignment methods while maintaining high consistency with established taxonomic relationships, even outperforming some multiple sequence alignment methods. These findings confirm CVTree's effectiveness and efficiency not only for whole-genome evolutionary studies but also for phylogenetic and taxonomic investigations based on genes.</description>

      <title>Pan-genome Analysis of Plastomes from Lamiales using PGR-TK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chloroplast sequences from the Lamiales order were analyzed using the Pangenome Research Toolkit (PGR-TK). Overall, most genera and families exhibited a high degree of sequence uniformity. However, at the genus level, Utricularia, Incarvillea, and Orobanche stood out as particularly divergent. At the family level, Orobanchaceae, Bignoniaceae and Lentibulariaceae displayed notably complex patterns in the generated plots. The PGR-TK algorithm successfully distinguished most genera within their respective families and often recognized misclassified plants.</description>

      <title>Individual or collective treatments: how to target antimicrobial use to limit the spread of \textit{Mannheimia haemolytica} among beef cattle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The overuse of antibiotics has become a major global concern due to its role in diminishing treatment effectiveness and positively selecting antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. This issue is particularly important in the beef cattle sector, where Bovine Respiratory Diseases (BRD) impose significant economic and welfare burdens. BRD are complex, multifactorial conditions primarily affecting young calves and feedlot cattle, caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors, and stressors. Despite efforts to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU), the cattle production system remains heavily reliant on antibiotics to control BRD, often through the implementation of collective treatments to prevent outbreaks. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of various treatment practices on the spread of BRD, specifically focusing on criteria for implementing collective treatments. Using a mechanistic stochastic model, we simulated the spread of \textit{Mannheimia haemolytica} in a multi-pen fattening operation under sixteen different scenarios, considering pen composition, individual risk levels, and treatment strategies. Our findings suggest that an alternative criterion for collective treatments based on the speed of the disease spread, could reduce BRD incidence and AMU more effectively than conventional methods. This research highlights the importance of responsible treatment practices and the potential benefits of novel criteria for collective treatment strategies in improving animal health. Moreover, it emphasizes the need for transparency on the exposure to risk factors along the production chain.</description>

      <title>Mutation and Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09812v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. It is suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which mutation acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>

      <title>From Single Genes to Populations: Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are there thermodynamic or information theoretic constraints governing mRNA expression? Here we use the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, expressions that can be evaluated from knowledge of the kinetic parameters of the two-state model. This allows us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply. Overall, our study presents a theoretical and data-driven approach to uncovering the potential thermodynamic and information theoretic constraints that dictate observed behaviors in transcription.</description>
