      <title>Higher order flow coefficients -- A Messenger of QCD medium formed in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic flow and fluctuations are sensitive observables to the initial state effects in heavy ion collisions and are characterized by the medium properties and final state interactions. Using event-shape observables, one can constrain the probability distributions of anisotropic flow coefficients, thus reducing the linear and nonlinear contributions in the measured higher-order harmonics. In this paper, we use transverse spherocity as an event shape observable to study the flow coefficients and elliptic flow fluctuations. Transverse spherocity is found to have a strong correlation with elliptic flow and its fluctuations. We exploit this feature of transverse spherocity to remove the contribution of elliptic flow from higher-order harmonics. The study is performed in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using a multi-phase transport model. The multi-particle Q-cumulant method estimates the anisotropic flow coefficients, which reduces the non-flow contributions. We observe a stronger system response to the flow coefficients for the events with smaller values of elliptic flow.</description>

      <title>Effects of a background magnetic field on dilepton radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using dilepton radiations as a QGP magnetometer. We calculate the dilepton production rate in the presence of a time-dependent magnetic field typically found in heavy-ion collisions. We compute the thermal dilepton spectra from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 19.6 GeV BES energy -- using a realistic (3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic simulation. We find the thermal dilepton elliptic flow to be very sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Generalized relativistic second-order spin hydrodynamics: coupling different rank tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the relativistic second-order spin hydrodynamics formalism previously developed using Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator formalism~\cite{She:2024rnx}. By applying a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in hydrodynamic gradients, we show that new second-order terms arise from the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. These terms emerge due to the presence of the acceleration vector in the system, which enables the generalization of Curie's theorem-based symmetry constraints for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks at separate space-time locations. In a generic quantum system described by the energy-momentum tensor, multiple conserved charges, and spin tensors, we identify these new terms within a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, charge-diffusion currents, rotational stress tensor, and boost-heat vector. Furthermore, we express all transport coefficients in the theory represented by two-point or three-point correlation functions as retarded Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Chiral $3\pi$-exchange potential using the method of unitary transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear potentials are known to exhibit a considerable degree of scheme dependence. For one- and two-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials, unitary ambiguities start showing up at the level of the leading relativistic corrections to the dominant static contributions. However, for the three-pion exchange potential, scheme-dependent contributions are expected to appear already at the static level. Here, we analyze the leading and subleading chiral $3\pi$-exchange NN potentials using the method of unitary transformation. In line with the expectations, our results for selected classes of contributions differ from those obtained by Kaiser using S-matrix matching. We present analytical expressions for the $3\pi$-exchange potential, which are off-shell consistent with the interactions used by the Bochum group, and discuss the numerical importance of the observed differences.</description>

      <title>Tilted-axis-cranking covariant density functional theory for the high-spin spectroscopy in $^{69}$Ga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tilted-axis-cranking covariant density functional theory is applied to investigate the three newly-observed positive-parity bands SI, SII, and SIII in $^{69}$Ga. The energy spectra and angular momenta are calculated and compared with the experimental data. For the yrast band SI, pairing correlations play a crucial role for the states with spin $I\leq 23/2\hbar$. The bands SII and SIII are suggested to be signature partner bands with positive and negative signatures, respectively. The transition probabilities $B(E2)$ for these bands are predicted, and await further experimental verification. By analyzing the angular momentum alignments microscopicly, it is revealed that the $g_{9/2}$ protons and neutrons play an important role in the description of the collective structure of $^{69}$Ga.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of light nuclei produced in the massive transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the dinuclear system (DNS) model by implementing the cluster transfer into the dissipation process, we systematically investigated the energy spectra and the angular distribution of the preequilibrium clusters (n, p, d, t, $^{3}$He, $\alpha$, $^{6,7}$Li, $^{8,9}$Be) in the massive transfer reactions of $^{12}$C+$^{209}$Bi, $^{14}$N+$^{159}$Tb, $^{14}$N+$^{169}$Tm, $^{14}$N+$^{181}$Ta, $^{14}$N+$^{197}$Au, $^{14}$N+$^{209}$Bi, $^{58,64,72}$Ni+$^{198}$Pt near the Coulomb barrier energies. It is found that the neutron emission is the most probable in comparison with the charged particles and the $\alpha$ yields are comparable with the hydrogen isotopes in magnitude. The preequilibrium clusters are mainly produced from the projectile-like and target-like fragments in the evolution of dinuclear system. The kinetic energy spectra manifest the Boltzmann distribution and the Coulomb potential influences the structure. The preequilibrium clusters follows the angular distribution of multinucleon transfer fragments.</description>

      <title>Probing the neutron-skin thickness via the double-charge exchange reactions in pion-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD) transport model, we investigate the influence of the neutron-skin thickness of neutron-rich nuclei on the pion emission in the double-charge exchange reactions near the $\triangle$-resonance energy, in particular, the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra, charged pion ratios et al. The reactions induced by pions are associated with the multiple processes of pions, nucleons and $\triangle$-resonances, correlated with the neutron-skin thickness. It is found that the kinetic energy spectra of $\pi^{-}$/$\pi^{+}$ ratio are sensitive to the neutron-skin thickness of neutron-rich nuclei for extracting the subsaturation-density symmetry energy. The double-charge exchange reactions are influenced by the neutron-skin thickness, in-medium properties of resonances, pion-nucleon potential and pion-nucleon scattering.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of low-lying intrinsic degrees of freedom and their impact on fusion cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work focuses on examining the low-lying intrinsic degrees of freedom and their impact on fusion dynamics. Fusion cross-sections were calculated using the coupled-channel code CCFULL for four specific reactions: $^{18}$O+$^{74}$Ge, $^{18}$O+$^{148}$Nd, $^{18}$O+$^{182}$W, and $^{18}$O+$^{186}$W, all conducted at energies below the Coulomb barrier across various energy levels. Vibrational and rotational features were studied concerning energy to distinguish their respective effects on fusion properties. The results indicate that the theoretical calculations for the nuclei $^{74}$Ge, $^{148}$Nd, $^{182}$W and $^{186}$W closely match the experimental data, particularly for the $2^+$ excited states. While slight discrepancies are observed for other excited states ($4^+$ and $6^+$), overall agreement remains significant. Additionally, the study reveals that hexadecapole deformation with different magnitudes have significant influences on the fusion cross-section. In cases where $\beta_4$ has a positive value, rotational levels beyond $6^+$ have minimal impact on the cross-section, resulting in a notable difference in the contribution of sequential channels. In contrast, for negative $\beta_4$ values, rotational energy levels up to the $2^+$ state substantially affect the fusion characteristics. Furthermore, the analysis extends to the estimation of the relative change ($\Delta\sigma_{fus}$) between the excited states and the ground state, both with and without considering coupling terms.</description>

      <title>Jet shape modification in a transport calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise quantification of the medium-modification of the high transverse momenta jets in relativistic heavy ion collisions rely on consistent modelling of elastic and inelastic energy loss suffered by the jet and the concurrent underlying medium evolution. We have developed a unified framework for jet and bulk medium evolution within a multiphase transport approach where the jets and medium share energy and momentum via multiple elastic scatterings and medium-induced gluon radiation during the parton transport. The formulation enables realistic predictions of jet based observables extended to a large radius of the jet cone in central Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The model provides reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimental data from inclusive jet suppression and the full jet shape function up to large radial distances induced by both the collisional and radiative jet energy loss and migration of the lost $p_T$ in the medium. We find that gradual degradation of jet energy through gluon emissions alters the energy-momentum evolution in the jet, essential to describe the entire range of jet shape ratio relative to proton-proton collisions. Pure collisional energy loss injects appreciable $p_T$ broadening and migration of the medium partons, resulting in an enhanced population at large angular distances in the jet-shape ratio.</description>

      <title>Probing $\Lambda$ potential via its $v_{2}$ flow in hypernuclei-induced reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperon potential, particularly its behavior at high densities, is crucial for resolving the ``hyperon puzzle'' in neutron stars and for advancing our understanding of the strong interactions between strange and non-strange particles in high baryon density environments. Using the hadronic transport model AMPT-HC, hypernucleus-nucleus collision is studied. It is found that at beam energies below the threshold for hyperon production, the hyperon elliptic flow exhibits noticeable asymmetry between the positive and negative rapidity regions and is sensitive to the strength of the hyperon potential, especially in the large negative rapidity region. One can extract the hyperon potential approximately twice the saturation density based on the hyperon elliptic flow in the negative rapidity region, and the hyperon potential around the saturation density based on the hyperon elliptic flow in the positive rapidity region.</description>

      <title>Constraining the neutron star equation of state by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling using the Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the nuclear matter equation of state within the relativistic mean field model by including the isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling term at a fundamental level using the Bayesian analysis. We used the nuclear saturation properties and recent astrophysical observations to constrain the dense matter equation of state. We obtained about 20000 sets of equations of states out of sampling about 60 millions sets of equations of states. All 20000 equations of states satisfy nuclear matter saturation properties at saturation densities and produces high mass neutron stars. In our findings, we find that the non-zero value of isoscalar-vector and isovector-vector coupling parameter and negative value of sigma meson self-coupling stiffen the equation of state. Our sets of equations of state produces neutron stars of mass larger than 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ to include the recent gravitational waves observation GW190419.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum fluctuations as a probe of thermalization and collective dynamics of QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that the steep fall in the variance of transverse momentum fluctuation in ultracentral Pb+Pb collision serves as a natural consequence of the thermalization of the QGP medium. We study the correlation between the spectra and $[p_T]$ which maps these fluctuations differentially and dubbed as $v_0(p_T)$. We highlight the importance of $v_0(p_T)$ showing that it plays similar role as anisotropic flow when probing the collective nature of QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>

      <title>Connecting afterglow light curves to the GRB central engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow light curves have the potential to inform us about presently unobserved stages in the aftermath of a neutron star merger. Using numerical simulations of short GRB afterglows we obtain an approximate quantitative connection between key aspects of the emission mechanism and the shapes of the resulting light curves. Employing simple, but efficient, parameterizations of the light curve based on a broken power law in terms of physical parameters, fitted to a large dataset of synthetic light curves, we apply basic machine learning techniques to determine the approximate connection between key input parameters of the forward shock model and the light curve parameters. Solving then the inverse problem, we find that the strength of the central engine can be reasonably accurately estimated even with very limited information. In particular, merely the position of jet-break in the on-axis, respectively the maximum in the off-axis light curve determines the kinetic energy at the tens of percent level.</description>

      <title>Realization of all-to-all fermion propagator for the first principle high accuracy strong interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a ``blending" algorithm that projects the all-to-all fermion propagator onto spatial low-frequency modes (LFM) combined with a stochastic estimate of spatial high-frequency modes (SHFM) at each time slice. This approach enables the calculation of arbitrary-point correlation functions for arbitrary hadron states in strongly interacting quantum field theories (QFT) with fermions, such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, LFM allows the construction of spatially extended hadron states below a certain energy threshold by diagonalizing multi-fermion interpolation fields. Meanwhile, the local interactions required for N-point correlation functions in QFT can be approximated in an unbiased manner through a reweighted summation of both LFM and SHFM contributions. To demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm, we obtained {\color{black} $g_A^u=0.895(15)$, $g_A^d=-0.338(15)$, $g_A^s=-0.0245(72)$, $g_A^{u+d+s}=0.533(28)$ and $g_A^{u-d}=1.2339(43)$ } for nucleon at $m_{\pi}=300$ MeV and $a=0.077$ fm using 40 configurations. The consistency check of the pion electric form factor and charge radius derived from 3-point and 4-point correlation functions is also provided.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly from (anomalous) spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the low energy fluctuations of spinning black Dp branes are described by a theory of spin hydrodynamics on a spacetime $\mathbb{M}_{p+1}\times \mathbb{T}^{n+2}$ in which the fluid is flowing on $\mathbb{M}_{p+1}$ and spinning on $\mathbb{T}^{n+2}$. Focusing on the hydrodynamic regime of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, we provide a geometric interpretation of the R-current anomaly in terms of a gravitational anomaly from the ten-dimensional point of view. This follows from the holographic duality between a spinning fluid in ten dimensions and an anomalous chiral fluid in four dimensions. We comment on the relations between the theory of spin hydrodynamics introduced here and other theories of spin hydrodynamics in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich and complex-scaling regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating both the Zel'dovich regularization and the complex scaling method. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen-Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Local equilibrium Wigner function for spin 1/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formal connections between the spin density matrix and the Wigner function for spin 1/2 particles are explored to determine their general structures. They suggest that the commonly used form of the local equilibrium Wigner function should be replaced by a new expression. The latter fulfills the necessary condition for the normalization of the mean spin polarization, which the former fails to reproduce. Moreover, the new form of the local equilibrium Wigner function leads to generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics, which were found before in the approach using the classical concept of spin. The forms of the conserved tensors obtained with the new Wigner function agree with those obtained with the classical spin method up to the second order in the spin polarization tensor; however, they disagree, as expected, for large values of the mean polarization.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross section for light nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to develop a complete calculation method of the electron scattering cross section for light nuclei. The specific calculations for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the incident electron energy does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The obtained scattering cross sections corresponding to an appropriate adjustment of the harmonic oscillator parameter along with the V-A structure interpret reasonably well the available experimental data at MeV energies and provide predictive information at GeV energies. This gives new perspectives in studying the structure of nuclei and the weak interactions via electron or lepton scattering at high (GeV) energies, considering nuclei rather than quarks.</description>

      <title>Probing $\Lambda$ potential at high and low densities via \(^3_{\Lambda}\)H production in C+C reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of Lambda hyperons and light hypernuclei in heavy-ion collisions provides critical insights into the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and hyperon interactions in dense matter, addressing the longstanding ``hyperon puzzle'' in neutron star physics. Using the INCL+ABLA and AMPT-HC models, we systematically investigate C+C collisions at beam energies of 1.1 and 1.9 GeV/nucleon to explore the sensitivity of hyperon and hypernuclei yields to the EoS and hyperon potential. Our results reveal that Lambda hyperon production is predominantly influenced by the nuclear EoS, while light hypernuclei formation (e.g., \(^3_{\Lambda}\)H) exhibits stronger sensitivity to the hyperon potential at high/low densities with the incident beam energies of 1.1/1.9 GeV. The study provides a framework for future experiments at facilities like HIAF and FAIR/GSI to resolve the hyperon puzzle, thus advancing our understanding of quantum chromodynamics in high-density regimes.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Seebeck effect of the QGP medium using a novel relaxation time approximation model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly energetic particle medium formed in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision displays a notable difference in the temperatures between its central and peripheral regions. This temperature gradient can generate an electric field within the medium, a phenomenon referred to as the Seebeck effect. We have estimated the Seebeck coefficient for a dense quark-gluon plasma medium by using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model within the kinetic theory framework. This study explores the Seebeck coefficient of individual quark flavors as well as the entire partonic medium. Our observation indicates that, for given current quark masses, the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient for each quark flavor as well as for the partonic medium decreases as the temperature rises and increases as the chemical potential increases. Furthermore, we have investigated the Seebeck effect by considering the partonic interactions within the quasiparticle model. In addition, we have presented a comparison between our findings and the results of the standard RTA model. We have observed that the Seebeck coefficient of the QGP medium gets conspicuously decreased in the novel RTA model as compared to that in the standard RTA model. A decreased Seebeck coefficient in the novel RTA model describes a smaller magnitude of induced electric field in the medium than that estimated by the standard RTA model. However, the rate of decline gets gradually smaller as the medium gets hotter for both the current quark mass scenario and the quasiparticle mass scenario. It is also found that, in the noninteracting case, the Seebeck coefficient possesses a slightly negative value in the high temperature region, unlike the quasiparticle description, where the Seebeck coefficient remains positive for the entire temperature range.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization of QCD in $1 + 1$ dimensions: four-fermion interactions from quark-gluon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. We use a functional formulation with covariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the gauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local fermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the local-equilibrium energy-momentum tensor in the Zubarev approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field in an approximation which accounts for space-time gradients of the hydrodynamical variables in local thermodynamical equilibrium. We show that the energy-momentum tensor receives corrections with respect to the standard local-equilibrium result. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the equation of state, is modified with respect to the one in global equilibrium. The obtained corrections might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>
