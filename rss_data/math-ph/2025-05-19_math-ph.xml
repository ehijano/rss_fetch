      <title>Character Expansion and the Harer-Zagier Transform of Knot Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HOMFLY--PT polynomial is a two-parameter knot polynomial that admits a character expansion, expressed as a sum of Schur functions over Young tableux. The Harer-Zagier transform (HZ), which converts the HOMFLY--PT polynomial into a rational polynomial in $q$ and $\lambda$, can also be expanded in terms of the HZ of characters. When the HZ is fully factorisable, such an expansion consists of Young diagrams of hook shape. However, for the vast majority of links the HZ is not factorisable. We show that, in non-factorised cases with up to 7-strands, the HZ transform can be decomposed into a sum of factorised terms. Furthermore, by the substitution $\lambda= q^\mu$ for a magic number $\mu$, the HZ can be reduced to a rational function in $q$ consisting of products of cyclotomic polynomials.</description>

      <title>A Framework of Model Reduction with Arbitrary Orders of Accuracy for the Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for constructing reduced models that approximate the Boltzmann equation with arbitrary orders of accuracy in terms of the Knudsen number $\mathit{Kn}$, applicable to general collision models in rarefied gas dynamics. The framework is based on an orthogonal decomposition of the distribution function into components of different orders in $\mathit{Kn}$, from which the reduced models are systematically derived through asymptotic analysis. Compared to the Chapman-Enskog expansion, our approach yields more tractable model structures. Notably, we establish that a reduced model retaining all terms up to $O(\mathit{Kn}^n)$ in the expansion surprisingly yields models with order of accuracy $O(\mathit{Kn}^{n+1})$. Furthermore, when the collision term is linearized, the accuracy improves dramatically to $O(\mathit{Kn}^{2n})$. These results extend to regularized models containing second-order derivatives. As concrete applications, we explicitly derive 13-moment systems of Burnett and super-Burnett orders valid for arbitrary collision models.</description>

      <title>A differential equation for a class of correlation kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new differential equation is derived for an object ${\widehat S}(E,E^\prime,x)$, which when integrated over the appropriate range in $x$, yields the kernel $K(E,E^\prime)$ with which $n$-point correlation functions can be computed in a wide class of models. When $E{=}E^\prime$, the equation reduces to the equation for the diagonal resolvent ${\widehat R}(E,x)$ of the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian ${H}{=}{-}\hbar^2\partial_x^2{+}u(x)$ that is familiar from the classic work of Gel'fand and Dikii, and which appears in many areas of physics. This more general equation may also prove to be useful in a wide range of applications. Some special cases relevant to random matrix theory are explored using analytical and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-duality plays a very important role in many applications in field theories possessing topological solitons. In general, the self-duality equations are first order partial differential equations such that their solutions satisfy the second order Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory. The fact that one has to perform one integration less to construct self-dual solitons, as compared to the usual topological solitons, is not linked to the use of any dynamically conserved quantity. It is important that the topological charge admits an integral representation, and so there exists a density of topological charge. The homotopic invariance of it leads to local identities, in the form of second order differential equations. The magic is that such identities become the Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory when the self-duality equations are imposed. We review some important structures underlying the concept of self-duality, and show how it can be applied to kinks, lumps, monopoles, Skyrmions and instantons.</description>

      <title>Surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Barrier relaxations of the classical and quantum optimal transport problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last fifteen years a significant progress was achieved by considering an entropic relaxation of the classical multi-partite optimal transport problem (MPOTP). The entropic relaxation gives rise to the rescaling problem of a given tensor. This rescaling can be achieved fast with the Sinkhorn type algorithms. Recently, it was shown that a similar approach works for the quantum MPOTP. However, the analog of the rescaling Sinkhorn algorithm is much more complicated than in the classical MPOTP. In this paper we show that the interior point method (IPM) for the primary and dual problems of classical and quantum MPOTP problems can be considered as barrier relaxations of the optimal transport problems (OTP). It is well known that the dual of the OTP are advantageous as it has much less variables than the primary problem. The IPM for the dual problem of the classical MPOTP are not as fast as the Sinkhorn type algorithm. However, IPM method for the dual of the quantum MPOTP seems to work quite efficiently.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Directed Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of quantum states defined by directed graphs, where the oriented edges represent interactions between ordered qubits. As a measure of entanglement, we adopt the Entanglement Distance - a quantity derived from the Fubini - Study metric on the system's projective Hilbert space.
  We demonstrate that this measure is entirely determined by the vertex degree distribution and remains invariant under vertex relabeling, underscoring its topological nature. Consequently, the entanglement depends solely on the total degree of each vertex, making it insensitive to the distinction between incoming and outgoing edges.
  These findings offer a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations and entanglement in complex systems, with promising implications for the design and analysis of quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Love waves in linear elastic isotropic Cosserat materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of Love waves in an isotropic half-space modelled as a linear {elastic isotropic} Cosserat material. To this aim, we show that a method commonly used to study Rayleigh wave propagation is also applicable to the analysis of Love wave propagation. This approach is based on the explicit solution of an algebraic Riccati equation, which operates independently of the traditional Stroh formalism. The method provides a straightforward numerical algorithm to determine the wave amplitudes and speed{s}. Beyond its numerical simplicity, the method guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a subsonic wave speed, addressing a problem that remains unresolved in most Cosserat solids generalised {continua} theories. Although often overlooked, proving the existence of an admissible solution is, in fact, the key point that validates or invalidates the entire analytical approach used to derive the equation determining the wave speed. Interestingly, the Love waves does not need the artificial introduction of a surface layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a certain class of Lorentzian manifolds, namely causal spacetimes without observer horizons, conformal transformations can be classified into two types: escaping and non-escaping. This means that successive powers of a given conformal transformation will either send all points to infinity, or none. As an application, we classify the conformal transformations of Einstein's static universe. We also study the question of essentiality in this context, i.e. which conformal transformations are isometric for some metric in the conformal class.</description>

      <title>Metastability for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model with unbounded random interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the metastable behaviour of the disordered Curie-Weiss-Potts (DCWP) model subject to a Glauber dynamics. The model is a randomly disordered version of the mean-field $q$-spin Potts model (CWP), where the interaction coefficients between spins are general independent random variables. These random variables are chosen to have fixed mean (for simplicity taken to be $1$) and well defined cumulant generating function, with a fixed distribution not depending on the number of particles. The system evolves as a discrete-time Markov chain with single spin flip Metropolis dynamics at finite inverse temperature $\beta$. We provide a comparison of the metastable behaviour of the CWP and DCWP models, when $N \to \infty$. First, we establish the metastability of the CWP model and, using this result, prove metastability for the DCWP model (with high probability). We then determine the ratio between the metastable transition time for the DCWP model and the corresponding time for the CWP model. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic tail behavior and moments of this ratio. Our proof combines the potential-theoretic approach to metastability with concentration of measure techniques, the latter adapted to our specific context.</description>

      <title>Theta classes: generalized topological recursion, integrability and $\mathcal{W}$-constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the intersection theory of the $\Theta^{r,s}$-classes, where $r \geq 2$ and $1 \le s \le r-1$, which are cohomological field theories obtained as the top degrees of Chiodo classes. We show that the recently introduced generalized topological recursion on the $(r,s)$ spectral curves computes the descendant integrals of the $\Theta^{r,s}$-classes. As a consequence, we deduce that the descendant potential of the $\Theta^{r,s}$-classes is a tau function of the $r$-KdV hierarchy, generalizing the Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten tau function (the special case $r=2$, $s=1$). We also explicitly compute the $\mathcal{W}$-constraints satisfied by the descendant potential, obtained as differential representations of the $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$-algebra at self-dual level. This work extends previously known results on the Witten $r$-spin class, the $r$-spin $\Theta$-classes (the case $s=r-1$), and the Norbury $\Theta$-classes (the special case $r=2$, $s=1$).</description>

      <title>Distance-based measures and Epsilon-measures for measurement-based quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a structured and elegant framework for quantifying quantum resources. While state-based resource theories have been extensively studied, their measurement-based resource theories remain relatively underexplored. In practical scenarios where a quantum state or a set of measurements is only partially known, conventional resource measures often fall short in capturing the resource content. In such cases, \epsilon-measures offer a robust alternative, making them particularly valuable. In this work, we investigate the quantification of measurement-based resources using distance-based measures, followed by a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of \epsilon-measures. We also extend our analysis by exploring the connections between \epsilon-measures and some key quantities relevant to resource manipulation tasks. Importantly, the analysis of resources based on sets of measurements are tedious compared to that of single measurements as the former allows more general transformations such as controlled implementation. Yet our framework applies not only to resources associated with individual measurements but also to those arising from sets of measurements. In short, our analysis is applicable to existing resource theories of measurements and is expected to be useful for all resource theories of measurements that are yet to be developed.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of the Anderson $\Phi_2^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the parabolic stochastic quantization equation associated to the $\Phi_2^4$ model on the torus in a spatial white noise environment. We study the long time behavior of this heat equation with independent multiplicative white noise and additive spacetime white noise, which is a singular SPDE in a singular environement and requires two different renormalization procedures. We prove that the solution is global in time with a strong a priori $L^p$ bound independent of the initial data in $C^{-\varepsilon}$ for large $p$. The quenched solution given the environment is shown to be an infinite dimensional Markov process which satisfies the strong Feller property. We prove exponential convergence to a unique invariant measure using a Doeblin criterion for the transition semigroup. In particular, our work is a generalization of a previous work by Tsatsoulis and Weber in a case which is not translation invariant hence the method makes no use of the reversibility of the dynamics or the explicit knowledge of the invariant measure and it is therefore in principle applicable to situations where these are not available such as the vector-valued case.</description>

      <title>On Kerr black hole formation with complete apparent horizon and a new approach toward Penrose inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arising from admissible extended scale-critical short-pulse initial data, we show that 3+1 dimensional Einstein vacuum equations admit dynamical Kerr black hole formation solutions. Our hyperbolic arguments combine the scale-critical gravitational-collapse result by An--Luk with the recent breakthrough by Klainerman--Szeftel on proving nonlinear Kerr stability with small angular momentum, which requires us to perform various specific coordinate changes and frame transformations. Furthermore, allowing large spacetime angular momentum, with new elliptic arguments and precise leading order calculations, we also solve the apparent horizon in Kerr black hole formation spacetimes (including Klainerman--Szeftel's Kerr stability spacetimes) and conduct an exploration, detailing the emergence, evolution, asymptotics and final state of the apparent horizon. Building on our analysis, without time symmetric assumption, we then put forward a new mathematical framework and prove both the dynamical Penrose inequality and the spacetime Penrose inequality in our black-hole formation spacetimes and in the perturbative regime of subextremal Kerr black holes. Collectively, without assuming any symmetry, we extend Christodoulou's celebrated trapped surface formation theorem to a black hole formation result.</description>

Abstract: Consider the event that there is a $+$ crossing from left to right in a box for the Ising model on the triangular lattice. We show that this event is noise sensitive under Glauber dynamics $t \mapsto \sigma_t$ in the subcritical regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$. We rely on the non-spectral approach from our previous work [TV23]. An important aspect in this more general setup is the study of the pair $(\sigma_0,\sigma_t)$ and in particular the establishment of properties such as finite-energy and spatial mixing.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A universal property of random trajectories in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated invariance property states that particles entering a bounded domain, with isotropic and uniform incidence, spend on average $\langle \ell \rangle=4V/S$ length inside, no matter how they scatter. We show that this remarkable property is merely the infinite-length limit of an even broader law: for any curves randomly placed and oriented in space -- stochastic or deterministic, generated by ballistic or diffusive dynamics, with possible stopping or branching, in two or more dimensions -- $ \displaystyle \frac{1}{\langle \ell \rangle}= \frac{1}{\langle L\rangle}+ \frac{1}{\langle \sigma \rangle} $, with $\langle\ell\rangle$ its mean in-domain path, $\langle L\rangle$ its mean total length, and $\langle\sigma\rangle$ the mean chord of the domain, a known geometric quantity related to the volume-to-surface ratio. Derived solely from the kinematic formula of integral geometry, the result is independent of step-length statistics, memory, absorption, and branching, making it equally relevant to photons in turbid tissue, active bacteria in micro-channels, cosmic rays in molecular clouds, or neutron chains in nuclear reactors. Monte-Carlo simulations spanning straight needles, Y-shapes, and isotropic random walks in 2D and 3D confirm the universality and demonstrate how a local measurement of $\langle \ell \rangle$ yields $\langle L\rangle$ without ever tracking the full trajectory.</description>

      <title>Exact surface energies and boundary excitations of the Izergin-Korepin model with generic boundary fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Izergin-Korepin model is an integrable model with the simplest twisted quantum affine algebra $U_q(A_2^{(2)})$ symmetry. Applying the $t-W$ method, we derive the homogeneous zero roots Bethe ansatz equations and the corresponding zero root patterns of the Izergin-Korepin model with generic integrable boundaries. Based on these results, we analytically compute the surface energies and boundary excitations in different regimes of boundary parameters of the model. It is shown that in some regimes, correlation effect appears between two boundary fields.</description>

      <title>Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is strongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathcal C\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))\hookrightarrow Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators preserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the twisted $D_2^{(2)}$ algebra (or simply the $D_2^{(2)}$ model) under generic open boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian of this model can be factorized into the sum of two staggered XXZ spin chains. Applying the $t$-$W$ method, we derive the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations for the zeros of the transfer matrix eigenvalues and the patterns of the corresponding zeros of the staggered XXZ spin chain with generic integrable boundaries. Based on these results, we analytically compute the surface energies and excitation energies of the $D_2^{(2)}$ model in different regimes of boundary parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1106.2965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let L be a line bundle over a compact complex manifold X and endow L and TX with Hermitian metrics. Our main result provides a formula for the average distribution of the exponentially small eigenvalues of the corresponding Dolbeault Laplacians associated to high tensor powers of L; which in physics terminology is a measure of "tunneling" of the Dolbeault complex. Along the way a new proof of the asymptotics of the induced Quillen metric on the corresponding determinant line is obtained. A brief comparison with the tunneling effect for Witten Laplacians and large deviation principles for fermions is also made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.00838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bialynicki-Birula and Charzynski argued that a gravitational wave emitted during the merger of a black hole binary may be approximated by a circularly polarized wave which may in turn trap particles [1]. In this paper we consider particle motion in a class of gravitational waves which includes, besides circularly polarized periodic waves (CPP) [2], also the one proposed by Lukash [3] to study anisotropic cosmological models. Both waves have a 7-parameter conformal symmetry which contains, in addition to the generic 5-parameter (broken) Carroll group, also a 6th isometry. The Lukash spacetime can be transformed by a conformal rescaling of time to a perturbed CPP problem. Bounded geodesics, found both analytically and numerically, arise when the Lukash wave is of Bianchi type VI. Their symmetries can also be derived from the Lukash-CPP relation. Particle trapping is discussed.</description>

Abstract: In a fractional Sobolev space $H^\frac{7}{4}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, we prove the desired low-regularity ill-posedness results for the 2D compressible Euler equations and the 2D ideal compressible MHD system. For the Euler equations, it is sharp with respect to the regularity of the fluid velocity and density. The mechanism behind the obtained ill-posedness is the instantaneous shock formation.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Compression of Free Fermionic Quantum Circuits: Particle Creation, Arbitrary Lattices and Controlled Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently we developed a local and constructive algorithm based on Lie algebraic methods for compressing Trotterized evolution under Hamiltonians that can be mapped to free fermions. The compression algorithm yields a circuit which scales linearly in the number of qubits, has a depth independent of evolution time and compresses time-dependent Hamiltonians. The algorithm is limited to simple nearest-neighbor spin interactions and fermionic hopping. In this work, we extend our methods to compress evolution with long-range fermionic hopping, thereby enabling the embedding of arbitrary lattices onto a chain of qubits for fermion models. Moreover, we show that controlled time evolution, as well as fermion creation and annihilation operators can also be compressed. We demonstrate our results by adiabatically preparing the ground state for a half-filled fermionic chain, simulating a $4 \times 4$ tight binding model on ibmq washington, and calculating the topological Zak phase on a Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. With these new developments, our results enable the simulation of a wider range of models of interest and the efficient compression of subcircuits.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb N$-Coefficient Binomial Polynomiality of Hurwitz Numbers and Generalized Dessin Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a certain type of Hurwitz numbers which count branched covers over the Riemann sphere admitting several branch points with fixed ramification types, one branch point with a fixed number of preimages, and one branch point with an arbitrary ramification type. We prove that the dependence of this kind of Hurwitz numbers on parts of the ramification type over the last point is a polynomial. Moreover, when expanding this polynomial in terms of products of binomial coefficients, we show that the coefficients are always non-negative integers via a pure combinatorial method. Our result generalizes the polynomiality in several models, including the one-part double Hurwitz numbers studied by Goulden-Jackson-Vakil, the one-part double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles studied by Shadrin-Spitz-Zvonkine, and the generalized dessin counting.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport on null hypersurfaces and the null energy condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of the present work is to study optimal transport on null hypersurfaces inside Lorentzian manifolds. The challenge here is that optimal transport along a null hypersurface is completely degenerate, as the cost takes only the two values $0$ and $+\infty$.
  The tools developed in the manuscript enable to give an optimal transport characterization of the null energy condition (namely, non-negative Ricci curvature in the null directions) for Lorentzian manifolds in terms of convexity properties of the Boltzmann--Shannon entropy along null-geodesics of probability measures.
  We obtain as applications: a stability result under convergence of spacetimes, a comparison result for null-cones, and the Hawking area theorem (both in sharp form, for possibly weighted measures, and with apparently new rigidity statements).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method can be applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ref. 1 asked whether deleting gates from a random quantum circuit architecture can ever make the architecture a better approximate $t$-design. We show that it can. In particular, we construct a family of architectures such that the approximate $2$-design depth decreases when certain gates are deleted. We also give some intuition for this construction and discuss the relevance of this result to the approximate $t$-design depth of the 1D brickwork. Deleting gates always decreases scrambledness in the short run, but can sometimes cause it to increase in the long run. Finally, we give analogous results for spectral gaps and when deleting edges of interaction graphs.</description>

      <title>Constant maps in equivariant topological strings and geometric modeling of fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, focusing in particular on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This approach regularizes the integration over non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces, producing finite results at each order in the expansion, as illustrated by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri--Strominger--Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Quantum Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_x=\Delta_t=\varepsilon$, QCAs constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles and their interactions with gauge fields, e.g., $(3+1)$D Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high-energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues, of which the most infamous is Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well understood in particular in the discrete-space but continuous-time settings of real-time/Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\varepsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend this analysis to the real-time discrete-space and discrete-time schemes that QCAs are. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCAs. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavoring-without-staggering way of fixing FD that does not break chiral symmetry. We explain how this method coexists with the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and illustrate this with a neutrino-like QCA.</description>

      <title>On continual classes of evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0501038</link>
      <description>arXiv:nlin/0501038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The original Miura transformation, considered as a nonlinear potential transformation, is applicable to a continual class of evolution equations, not only to discrete integrable equations and their hierarchies. The same continual class of evolution equations appears from a different problem, namely, from the gauge-invariant description of a zero-curvature representation with a definite x-part containing no essential parameter.</description>
