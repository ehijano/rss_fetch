      <title>Kakeya problem and projection problem for $k$-geodesics in Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kakeya problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is about estimating the size of union of $k$-planes; the projection problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is about estimating the size of projection of a set onto every $k$-plane ($1\le k\le n-1$). The $k=1$ case has been studied on general manifolds in which $1$-planes become geodesics, while $k\ge 2$ cases were still only considered in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We formulate these problems on homogeneous spaces, where $k$-planes are replaced by $k$-dimensional totally geodesic submanifolds. After formulating the problem, we prove a sharp estimate for Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of a function from its two spherical Radon transforms with the centers on a plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperplane is a set of non-injectivity of the spherical Radon transform (SRT) in the space of continuous functions in R^d. In this article, for the reconstruction of an unknown function f from C(R^3) (the support can be non-compact), using the spherical Radon transform over spheres centered on a plane, the injectivity of the so-called two data spherical Radon transform is considered. An inversion formula of the transform that uses the local data of the spherical integrals to reconstruct the unknown function is presented. Such inversions are the mathematical base of modern modalities of imaging, such as Thermo and photoacoustic tomography and radar imaging, and have theoretical significance in many areas of mathematics</description>

      <title>Localised variants of multilinear restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit certain localised variants of the Bennett-Carbery-Tao multilinear restriction theorem, recently proved by Bejenaru. We give a new proof of Bejenaru's theorem, relating the estimates to the theory of Kakeya-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities. Moreover, the new proof allows for a substantial generalisation, exploiting the full power of the Kakeya-Brascamp-Lieb theory.</description>

      <title>Fractional type operators on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\rho(\cdot)$ be the Koranyi norm on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^{n} \equiv (\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times \mathbb{R}, \, \cdot \, )$ defined by \[ \rho(x,t) = \left( |x|^{4} + 16 t^{2} \right)^{1/4}, \,\,\,\, (x,t) \in \mathbb{H}^{n}. \] For $0 \leq \alpha &lt; Q:=2n+2$, $m \in \mathbb{N} \cap \left(1 - \frac{\alpha}{Q}, \infty \right)$, and $m$ positive constants $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_m$ such that $\alpha_1 + \cdot \cdot \cdot + \alpha_m = Q - \alpha$, we consider the following generalization of the Riesz potential on $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ \[ T_{\alpha, \, m}f(x,t) = \int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}} f(y,s) \prod_{j=1}^{m} \rho\left((A_j y, r_j^{-2} s)^{-1} \cdot ( x, t)\right)^{-\alpha_j} \, dy \, ds, \] where, in the case $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; Q$, the $A_j$'s are matrices belonging to $Sp (2n, \mathbb{R}) \cap SO(2n)$ and $r_j = 1$ for every $j=1, ..., m$; for $\alpha = 0$, we consider $A_j = r_j^{-1} \, I_{2n \times 2n}$ for every $j=1, ..., m$, where the $r_j$'s are positive constants such that $r_{i}^{2} - r_{j}^{2} \neq 0$ if $i \neq j$. In this note we study the behavior of these operators on variable Hardy spaces in $\mathbb{H}^{n}$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Hardy inequalities and capacity density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a pointwise fractional Hardy inequality implies a fractional Hardy inequality, defined via a Gagliardo-type seminorm. The proof consists of two main parts. The first one is to characterize the pointwise fractional Hardy inequality in terms of a fractional capacity density condition. The second part is to show the deep open-endedness or self-improvement property of the fractional capacity density, which we accomplish in the setting of a complete geodesic space equipped with a doubling measure. These results are new already in the standard Euclidean setting.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the approximation characteristics of the Nikol'skii-Besov classes of functions with mixed smoothness in the space $B_{q,1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact-order estimates are obtained for some approximation characteristics of the classes of periodic multivariate functions with mixed smoothness (the Nikol'skii-Besov classes $B^{\boldsymbol{r}}_{p, \theta}$) in the space $B_{q,1}$, $1 \leq p, q \leq \infty$, which norm is stronger than the $L_q$-norm. It is shown, that in the multivariate case (in contrast to the univariate) in most of the considered situations the obtained estimates differ in order from the corresponding estimates in the space $L_q$.
  Besides, a significant progress is made in estimates for the considered approximation characteristics of the classes $B^{\boldsymbol{r}}_{p, \theta}$ in the space $B_{q, 1}$ comparing to the known estimates in the space $L_q$.</description>

      <title>Concerning the stability of exponential systems and Fourier matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier matrices naturally appear in many applications and their stability is closely tied to performance guarantees of algorithms. The starting point of this article is a result that characterizes properties of an exponential system on a union of cubes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in terms of a general class of Fourier matrices and their extreme singular values. This relationship is flexible in the sense that it holds for any dimension $d$, for many types of exponential systems (Riesz bases, Riesz sequences, or frames) and for Fourier matrices with an arbitrary number of rows and columns. From there, we prove new stability results for Fourier matrices by exploiting this connection and using powerful stability theorems for exponential systems. This paper provides a systematic exploration of this connection and suggests some natural open questions.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Newton series and the asymptotics of finite differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose a complex function $f$ has a Lebesgue measurable inverse Laplace transform. We show that the $n$th order forward and backward differences of $f$ at $z_0\in\mathbb{C}$ tend to zero as $n\to\infty$ whenever $z_0$ lies in the region of absolute convergence of $f$. Under the same hypothesis, we show that the Newton series of $f$ centered at $z_0$ exists and converges in the half-plane $\Re(z)&gt;\Re(z_0)$. Assuming instead that $f$ has a Lebesgue measurable inverse Fourier transform, we show that the $n$th order forward, backward, and central differences of $f$ at any $y\in\mathbb{R}$ are $o(2^n)$. Consequently, we show that the binomial sum $\sum_{k\geq0}{n\choose k}f(k)$ is $o(2^n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note aims to present novel positive linear operators involving the Wright function. Furthermore, the present research established the moments of these newly defined operators and estimated the convergence rate using the classical modulus of continuity. Additionally, the convergence rate in the Lipschitz spaces, their A-statistical convergence property, and $({\lambda}, {\gamma})$-statistical convergence properties have been covered.</description>

      <title>Convolution powers of unbounded measures on the positive half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a right-continuous nondecreasing and unbounded function $V$ of at most exponential growth, which vanishes on the negative halfline, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes convolution powers $V^{\ast(j)}(t)$ as both $j$ and $t$ tend to infinity. We obtain a comprehensive asymptotic formula for $V^{\ast(j)}(t)$, which is valid across different regimes of simultaneous growth of $j$ and $t$. Our main technical tool is an exponential change of measure, which is a standard technique in the large deviations theory. Various applications of our result are given.</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kow, Larson, Salo and Shahgholian recently initiated the study of quadrature domains for the Helmholtz equation and developed an associated theory of partial balayage of measures. The present paper offers an alternative approach to partial balayage in this context that yields stronger results. Applications are given to quadrature domains and to a domain evolution question that is analogous to Hele-Shaw flow.</description>

      <title>Extremal problems in BMO and VMO involving the Garsia norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $L^2$ function $f$ on the unit circle $\mathbb T$, we put $$\Phi_f(z):=\mathcal P(|f|^2)(z)-|\mathcal Pf(z)|^2,\qquad z\in\mathbb D,$$ where $\mathbb D$ is the open unit disk and $\mathcal P$ is the Poisson integral operator. The Garsia norm $\|f\|_G$ is then defined as $\sup_{z\in\mathbb D}\left(\Phi_f(z)\right)^{1/2}$, and the space ${\rm BMO}$ is formed by the functions $f\in L^2$ with $\|f\|_G&lt;\infty$. If $\|f\|^2_G=\Phi_f(z_0)$ for some point $z_0\in\mathbb D$, then $f$ is said to be a norm-attaining ${\rm BMO}$ function, written as $f\in{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$. Note that ${\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$ contains ${\rm VMO}$, the space of functions with vanishing mean oscillation. We study, first, the functions $f$ in $L^\infty$ (as well as in $L^\infty\cap{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$) with the property that $\|f\|_G=\|f\|_\infty$. The analytic case, where $L^\infty$ gets replaced by $H^\infty$, is discussed in more detail. Secondly, we prove that every function $f\in{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$ with $\|f\|_G=1$ is an extreme point of ${\rm ball}\,({\rm BMO})$, the unit ball of ${\rm BMO}$ with respect to the Garsia norm. This implies that the extreme points of ${\rm ball}\,({\rm VMO})$ are precisely the unit-norm ${\rm VMO}$ functions. As another consequence, we arrive at an amusing "geometric" characterization of inner functions.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Hausdorff dimension of Besicovitch sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keich (1999) showed that the sharp gauge function for the generalized Hausdorff dimension of Besicovitch sets in $\mathbb R^2$ is between $r^2\log 1/r$ and $r^2(\log 1/r) (\log\log 1/r)^{2+\varepsilon}$ by refining an argument of Bourgain (1991). It is not known whether the iterated logarithms in Keich's bound are necessary. In this paper we construct a family of Besicovitch line sets whose sharp gauge function is smaller than $r^2(\log 1/r) (\log\log 1/r)^{\varepsilon}$. Moreover, these Besicovitch sets are minimal in the sense that there is essentially only one line in the set pointing in each direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The known asymptotic relations interconnecting Jacobi, Laguerre, and Hermite classical orthogonal polynomials are generalized to the corresponding exceptional orthogonal polynomials of codimension $m$. It is proved that $X_m$-Laguerre exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type I, II, or III can be obtained as limits of $X_m$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials of the same type. Similarly, $X_m$-Hermite exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type III can be derived from $X_m$-Jacobi or $X_m$-Laguerre ones. The quadratic transformations expressing Hermite classical orthogonal polynomials in terms of Laguerre ones is also extended to even $X_{2m}$-Hermite exceptional orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the Schatten class $S^p$ of the commutator of Riesz transforms $[b,R_j]$ in $\mathbb R^n$ ($j=1,\ldots, n$) in the two weight setting for $n&lt; p&lt;\infty$, by introducing the condition that the symbol $b$ being in Besov spaces associated with the given two weights. At the critical index $p=n$, the commutator $[b,R_j]$ belongs to Schatten class $S^{n}$ if and only if $b$ is a constant, and to the weak Schatten class $S^{n,\infty}$ if and only if $b$ is in an oscillation sequence space associated with the given two weights. As a direct application, we have the Schatten class estimate for A. Connes' quantised derivative in the two weight setting.</description>

      <title>Newton's Method for Global Free Flight Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globally optimal free flight trajectory optimization can be achieved with a combination of discrete and continuous optimization. A key requirement is that Newton's method for continuous optimization converges in a sufficiently large neighborhood around a minimizer. We show in this paper that, under certain assumptions, this is the case.</description>

      <title>A short proof for Rankin--Cohen brackets and generating operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the concept of "generating operators" for a countable family of operators introduced in the recent paper (arXiv:2306.16800), we find a method to reconstruct the Rankin--Cohen brackets from a very simple multivariable contour integral, and obtain a new proof of their covariance. We also establish a closed formula of the "generating operator" for the Rankin--Cohen brackets in full generality.</description>

      <title>Measures for the summation of Irwin series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09083v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider among the Irwin series (1916) those which are the sums of the reciprocals of the integers having $k$ occurrences of a given digit $d$ (in an arbitrary base $b$). We formulate them as log-like integrals against suitable measures on the unit interval. This leads to representations as geometrically convergent alternating series. The alternating series involve the moments of these measures. The measures converge for $k\to\infty$ to the Lebesgue measure (up to a factor $b$). This puts Farhi theorem (2008) about $b\log b$ being the limit of the Irwin sums for $k\to\infty$ in a new light. The moments obey linear recurrences. This allows evaluating them numerically hence the Irwin sums in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Symmetry criteria for the equality of interior and exterior shape factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lienhard (2019) reported that the shape factor of the interior of a simply-connected region ($\Omega$) is equal to that of its exterior ($\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\Omega$) under the same boundary conditions. In that study, numerical examples supported the claim in particular cases; for example, it was shown that for certain boundary conditions on circles and squares, the conjecture holds. In the present paper, we show that the conjecture is not generally true, unless some additional condition is met. We proceed by elucidating why the conjecture does in fact hold in all of the examples analysed by Lienhard. We thus deduce a simple criterion which, when satisfied, ensures the equality of interior and exterior shape factors in general. Our criterion notably relies on a beautiful and little-known symmetry method due to Hersch (1982) which we introduce in a tutorial manner.</description>
