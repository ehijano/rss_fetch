      <title>Obvious Strategy-proofness with Respect to a Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study obvious strategy-proofness with respect to a partition of the set of agents. It encompasses strategy-proofness as a special case when the partition is the coarsest one and obvious strategy-proofness when the partition is the finest. For any partition, it falls between these two extremes. We establish two general properties of this new notion and apply it to the simple anonymous voting problem with two alternatives and strict preferences.</description>

      <title>Centralized Selection with Preferences in the Presence of Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the scenario in which there are multiple institutions, each with a limited capacity for candidates, and candidates, each with preferences over the institutions. A central entity evaluates the utility of each candidate to the institutions, and the goal is to select candidates for each institution in a way that maximizes utility while also considering the candidates' preferences. The paper focuses on the setting in which candidates are divided into multiple groups and the observed utilities of candidates in some groups are biased--systematically lower than their true utilities. The first result is that, in these biased settings, prior algorithms can lead to selections with sub-optimal true utility and significant discrepancies in the fraction of candidates from each group that get their preferred choices. Subsequently, an algorithm is presented along with proof that it produces selections that achieve near-optimal group fairness with respect to preferences while also nearly maximizing the true utility under distributional assumptions. Further, extensive empirical validation of these results in real-world and synthetic settings, in which the distributional assumptions may not hold, are presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Volunteer's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The volunteer's dilemma is a well-known game in game theory that models the conflict players face when deciding whether to volunteer for a collective benefit, knowing that volunteering incurs a personal cost. In this work, we introduce a quantum variant of the classical volunteer's dilemma, generalizing it by allowing players to utilize quantum strategies. Employing the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantization framework, we analyze a multiplayer quantum volunteer's dilemma scenario with an arbitrary number of players, where the cost of volunteering is shared equally among the volunteers. We derive analytical expressions for the players' expected payoffs and demonstrate the quantum game's advantage over the classical game. In particular, we prove that the quantum volunteer's dilemma possesses symmetric Nash equilibria with larger expected payoffs compared to the unique symmetric Nash equilibrium of the classical game, wherein players use mixed strategies. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Nash equilibria we identify are Pareto optimal. Our findings reveal distinct dynamics in volunteer's dilemma scenarios when players adhere to quantum rules, underscoring a strategic advantage of decision-making in quantum settings.</description>

      <title>Rationally Inattentive Statistical Discrimination: Arrow Meets Phelps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When information acquisition is costly but flexible, a principal may rationally acquire information that favors one group over another. The former group faces incentives to invest in becoming productive, while the latter is discouraged from such investments. The principal, in turn, ignores the productivity difference between groups unless the underinvested group surprises him with a genuinely outstanding outcome. We give conditions under which the discriminatory equilibrium is most preferred by the principal, despite all groups being ex-ante identical. Our results inform the discussion of affirmative action, implicit bias, and occupational segregation and stereotypes.</description>

      <title>Bargaining via Weber's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the two-player bargaining problem using Weber's law in psychophysics, which is applied to the perception of utility changes. By applying this law, one of the players (or both of them) defines lower and upper utility thresholds, such that once the lower threshold is established, bargaining continues in the inter-threshold domain where the solutions are acceptable to both parties. This provides a sequential solution to the bargaining problem, and it can be implemented iteratively reaching well-defined outcomes. The solution is Pareto-optimal, symmetric, and is invariant to affine-transformations of utilities. For susceptible players, iterations are unnecessary, so they converge in one stage toward the (axiomatic) Nash solution of the bargaining problem. This situation also accounts for the asymmetric Nash solution, where the weights of each player are expressed via their Weber constants. Thus the Nash solution is reached without external arbiters and without requiring the independence of irrelevant alternatives. For non-susceptible players our approach leads to different results.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>
