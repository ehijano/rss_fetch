      <title>Infrared Freeze-In of Magnetic Dipole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for the cosmological production of keV - GeV mass dark matter that interacts with the Standard Model through a small effective magnetic dipole moment. Such an interaction can be radiatively generated if dark matter couples to heavier charged particles. Previous studies have focused on the case where these charged states are much heavier than the reheat temperature, such that freeze-in production of dark matter is sensitive to the ultraviolet details of reheating. Here, we instead consider the possibility that these heavy states have masses comparable to the dark matter mass and are charged under a new kinetically-mixed $U(1)'$. As a result, dark matter production is dominated by the infrared freeze-in of the heavy charged states that subsequently thermalize the rest of the dark sector to a temperature much below that of the visible bath. We delineate regions of parameter space consistent with cosmological and astrophysical constraints and identify benchmark scenarios that can guide the next generation of direct detection experiments searching for spin-dependent scattering of sub-GeV dark matter.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Effects on Atomic Measurements of the Weinberg Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a complete expression for the neutrino-mediated quantum force beyond the four-Fermi approximation within the Standard Model. Using this new result, we study the effect of atomic parity violation caused by neutrinos. We find that the neutrino effect is sizable compared to the current experimental sensitivity and can also significantly affect the value of the Weinberg angle measured in atomic systems. This offers a promising method for detecting the neutrino force in the future and facilitates the application of precision atomic physics as a probe for neutrino physics and the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Measuring CP violation using quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate direct CP violation in neutral meson decays by reconstructing the associated density matrices and measuring their difference using the trace distance. Our results cover neutral kaon decays into two scalar triplets of isospin space, specifically the pions, and decays of $B$- and $D$- mesons into two scalar octets of SU(3) flavor space. We briefly discuss the quantum properties of these states, including entanglement, contextuality, and nonlocality. Additionally, we demonstrate a comparable approach for spin-1 final states by employing a density matrix describing states in the space of helicities. The significance of CP violation obtained through this method is consistently comparable, and often surpasses that obtained using only single, or combinations of, asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Complete next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the decay matrix in $\boldsymbol{B}$-meson mixing at leading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute next-to-next-to-leading order corrections to the decay width difference of mass eigenstates and the charge-parity (CP) asymmetry $a_{\rm fs}$ in flavour-specific decays of neutral $B$ mesons. We include both current-current and penguin operators at three-loop order. All input integrals in the transition amplitude are reduced to a small set of master integrals which depend on the ratio of the charm and bottom quark masses. The latter are computed using semi-analytic methods which provide deep expansions around properly selected values of $m_c/m_b$. We provide numerical results for $\Delta\Gamma$ and $\Delta\Gamma/\Delta M$, both for the $B_d$ and $B_s$ system, including a detailed uncertainty analysis. Using the experimental value for the mass difference $\Delta M_s$ we predict $\Delta\Gamma_s=(0.078 \pm 0.015) ~\mbox{ps}^{-1}$. For the CP asymmetries we find $ a_{\rm fs}^s = (2.27 \pm 0.13 ) \times 10^{-5}$ and $a_{\rm fs}^d = -(5.19 \pm 0.30)~\times~10^{-4}$. Furthermore, we show that the ratios $(\Delta\Gamma_s/\Delta M_s) / (\Delta\Gamma_d/\Delta M_d)$ and $\Delta\Gamma_d / \Delta\Gamma_s$ can be predicted with high precision. The former quantity permits the prediction $\Delta\Gamma_d=(0.00215\pm 0.00013)~\mbox{ps}^{-1}$ from the measurements of $\Delta M_{d,s}$ and $\Delta\Gamma_s$. We further discuss the impact of $\Delta\Gamma_d/\Delta\Gamma_s$ on the CKM unitarity triangle and present ready-to-use formulae which permit improved predictions once updated results for the operator matrix elements are available.</description>

      <title>Theory of inverse beta decay for reactor antineutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse beta decay (IBD), $\overline{\nu}_e p \to e^+ n \left( \gamma \right)$, is the main detection channel for reactor antineutrinos in water- and hydrocarbon-based detectors. As reactor antineutrino experiments now target sub-percent-level sensitivity to oscillation parameters, a precise theoretical description of IBD, including recoil, weak magnetism, nucleon structure, and radiative corrections, becomes essential. In this work, we give a detailed and precise calculation of the total and differential cross sections for radiative IBD, $\overline{\nu}_e p \to e^+ n \gamma$. We use a heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory framework, systematically incorporating electroweak, electromagnetic, and strong-interaction corrections. We derive new analytic cross-section expressions, clarify the collinear structure of radiative corrections, and provide a systematic uncertainty analysis. We also discuss phenomenological applications for reactor antineutrino experiments, e.g., JUNO, and neutron decay. Our results enable sub-permille theoretical precision, supporting current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>On radiative corrections to inverse beta decay at low energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute electromagnetic radiative corrections in the inverse beta decay, $\bar{\nu}_e + p \rightarrow e^+ + n$, at reactor antineutrino energies within the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, provide the most accurate cross-section predictions for this process, and present a complete error budget. For the first time, we consistently include quantum electrodynamics, chromodynamics, and electroweak contributions and present the positron energy spectrum accounting for radiative corrections. Our calculation also improves on previous evaluations by incorporating permille-level contributions. The results can be readily applied to normalize the reactor antineutrino flux, make precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters, and search for new physics at nuclear power plants.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole spectra derived from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb identified-hadron $\bf v_2(p_t)$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $p_t$-differential quantity $v_2(p_t)$ is meant to measure elliptic flow manifested by a dense QCD medium formed in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. Elliptic flow may be referred to more neutrally as a cylindrical quadrupole component of the transverse motion of particle sources within a collision. As defined, $v_2(p_t)$ relies on an implicit assumption that almost all produced particles emerge from a single source. This article describes a detailed study of the algebraic structure of $v_2(p_t)$. A procedure is developed to derive a common monopole boost (radial flow) value and quadrupole $p_t$ spectra for several hadron species. The method is applied to $v_2(p_t)$ data for three hadron species from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions. According to available $v_2(p_t)$ data the assumption of a single dominant particle source within A-A collisions is unjustified. Combined with a previous study of quadrupole amplitude variation for 200 GeV $p$-$p$ collisions these results demonstrate that quadrupole structure is related to a novel QCD process separate from projectile-nucleon dissociation and jet production. Given quadrupole evolution it is unlikely that a hydrodynamic description is relevant to that process.</description>

      <title>(3+1)D event-by-event pre-equilibrium dynamics in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far a major source of uncertainty in the study of heavy-ion collisions arises from the early time dynamics which includes initial state and pre-equilibrium dynamics. The state-of-the-art framework, KoMPoST, employs non-equilibrium Green's functions to propagate the initial energy-momentum tensor to the hydrodynamic phase, yet currently only treats transverse plane dynamics under boost-invariant conditions. In this work, we extend KoMPoST to include non-boost-invariant responses to initial conditions, essential for accurately capturing the longitudinal structures observed in heavy-ion collisions. Non-boost-invariant fluctuations on top of a homogeneous background are evolved using (3+1)D response functions calculated in kinetic theory. To assess kinetic theory's transition towards hydrodynamic evolution, we systematically compare the out-of-equilibrium shear-stress tensor from KoMPoST-3D with estimates based on Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. Subsequently, a comprehensive (3+1)D framework, McDIPPER+KoMPoST-3D+CLVisc+SMASH, is utilized to simulate the complete spacetime evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of key observables, including longitudinal structure of anisotropic flow, to variations in the hydrodynamic initialization time is thoroughly investigated.</description>

      <title>New Monopoles in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monopoles play important roles in physics. In this work we discuss the new monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories, the standard model, the Georgi-Glashow model, and QCD. The standard model has two totally different types of monopoles, the Cho-Maison type monopoles which have the weak boson dressing and the electromagnetically neutral magnetic monopoles (the naked one and the one with the W boson dressing) which carries the neutral magnetic charge $4\pi/\bae$. The Georgi-Glashow model has a new monopole, the Wu-Yang monopole which has the W boson dressing, in addition to the well known 'tHooft-Polyakov monopole. And QCD has a new monopole, the Wu-Yang monopole which has the chromon dressing. We show how to construct the new monopoles and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopoles. The new monopoles could have deep implications not just in high energy physics but also in low energy physics.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Structure from Basis Light-Front Quantization : Status and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advancements in understanding nucleon structure within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework--a fully relativistic, nonperturbative approach to solving quantum field theories. In its initial phase, we start with the leading Fock sector $|qqq\rangle$ and an effective light-front Hamiltonian incorporating confinement and one-gluon exchange within which BLFQ can already successfully describe key nucleon observables. The framework has since been extended to include the next-to-leading Fock sector $|qqqg\rangle$, enabling studies of gluonic contributions to the nucleon's internal structure, including gluon helicity, orbital angular momentum, and three-dimensional imaging through generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GPDs and TMDs). Most recently, BLFQ has achieved a significant milestone by computing nucleon light-front wavefunctions as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian without an explicit confining potential. These calculations, including Fock sectors up to $|qqqq\bar{q}\rangle$, further develop the path to first-principles predictions of quark and gluon matter densities, helicity and transversity distributions, and spin observables, showing qualitative agreement with experimental and phenomenological results. Together, these developments highlight BLFQ's growing capacity to provide an increasingly complete and realistic picture of nucleon structure grounded in QCD.</description>

      <title>Leading-twist gluon transverse momentum dependent distributions from large-momentum effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the perturbative calculation of the leading-twist gluon transverse momentum dependent distribution functions (TMDPDFs) at one-loop level within large-momentum effective theory. By employing the basis of circular polarizations, we generalize the gluon-gluon correlator to a matrix $\Phi_{\Lambda \Lambda^\prime}^{ij}(x,\bm{k}_T^2;S)$ in the gluon $\otimes$ hadron spin space. Incorporating the transverse momentum of external states, we derive the leading-twist gluon TMDPDFs and quasi-TMDPDFs at one-loop level. Our calculations reveal nonzero distributions for the gluon TMDPDFs $f_{1T}^{\perp g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$, $h_{1}^{\perp g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$, $h_{1T}^{g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$, and $h_{1T}^{\perp g}(x,\bm{k}_T^2)$. These findings enable future lattice QCD simulations to extract these gluon TMDPDFs, which will facilitate a complete determination of nucleon tomography.</description>

      <title>Impact of antiparticle degrees of freedom on neutrino flavor oscillations in frames of quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrino flavor oscillations using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT), where neutrinos are taken to be virtual particles. One deals with the propagators of neutrino mass eigenstates in this formalism. Previously, while applying this approach to neutrino oscillations in external fields, we decomposed the propagators and used only the particle contribution in the calculation of the matrix element. In the present work, we carefully justify the validity of this kind of transformation by considering neutrino oscillations in vacuum. In principle, the results obtained can be extended for the QFT applied to neutrino oscillations in external fields.</description>

Abstract: We study factorizable contributions to two-body nonleptonic decays of $B$ mesons using the light-cone sum rule method. By constructing three-point correlation functions and incorporating light-cone distribution amplitudes, we compute the hadronic matrix elements and branching ratios for decay channels $B^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-$, $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^0$, $B^0 \to K^+\pi^-$, and $B^0 \to K^+K^-$. The results are in agreement with experimental data within uncertainties. We also estimate the branching ratio of $B_s^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-$ to be approximately $0.781\times10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Damped oscillation regular structures from the deuteron "effective" electromagnetic form factor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deuteron ``D'' is the simplest nucleus with the spin S=1, therefore its electromagnetic structure is completely described by three different, the charge $G_C(t)$, magnetic $G_M(t)$ and quadrupole $G_Q(t)$ form factors, where $t=-q^2$ is the momentum transfer squared of the electrons or the deuterons in the elastic scattering of electrons on deuterons. All three deuteron form factors are theoretically related to the functions $A(t)$, $B(t)$ and $T_{20}(t)$ to be numerically evaluated with errors, whereby $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ in a measurement of the differential cross section of elastic scattering of unpolarized electrons on unpolarized deuterons, and $T_{20}$ in measurements of the elastic scattering of the longitudinally polarized electrons, respectively also on polarized deuteron target. The obtained data are utilized to fix parameters of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors to be constructed in the form of the Unitary and Analytic model. Afterwards these form factors are analytically continued into the time-like region, with the aim to predict artificial behavior of the total cross section $\sigma_{tot}(e^+e^- \to D \bar D)(s)$. By means of the latter artificial data with errors on the deuteron ``effective'' electromagnetic form factor are produced theoretically. Finally, such data render a possibility to investigate the deuteron damped oscillation regular structures.</description>

      <title>Reviving $Z^\prime$ Portal Dark Matter with Conversion Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many new physics models with extended gauge symmetry, the new gauge boson $Z'$ could mediate the interactions between the dark matter and standard model particles. For the conventional $Z^\prime$ portal dark matter, the collider and the direct detection constraints typically pose a significant challenge. To address this pressing issue, we present in this paper a new benchmark model based on the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which introduces a Dirac dark fermion $\tilde{\chi}_1$ and a heavier partner $\tilde{\chi}_2$ with zero and nonzero $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge, respectively. Including the mass term $\delta m \bar{\tilde{\chi}}_1\tilde{\chi}_2$ results in the dark fermions $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ in the mass eigenstate, where the lighter one $\chi_1$ is regarded as the dark matter candidate. Various intriguing processes for the relic density arise with the compressed mass spectrum $m_{\chi_1}\simeq m_{\chi_2}$, such as the coscattering $\chi_2f\to\chi_1f$, the conversion $\chi_2\chi_i\to\chi_1\chi_j$, and the coannihilation $\chi_1\chi_2\to f\bar{f}$ processes. Suppressed by the small mixing angle $\theta$ between the dark fermions, the small effective gauge coupling of dark matter $\chi_1$ to the gauge boson $Z'$ is one distinct feature of this model, rendering phenomenology in many aspects more promising. In this paper, we investigate the production of dark matter through new mechanisms within the frameworks of resonance and secluded scenarios. The impacts of phenomenological constraints from collider, dark matter, and cosmology are also taken into account. We report that the conversion mechanism is both favored by the resonance and secluded scenarios under current constraints.</description>

      <title>On the existence of bound states in SIMP dark sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) scenarios, dark matter is comprised of stable dark pions whose $3\to 2$ or $4\to 2$ reactions set the dark matter relic abundance. Recent work has shown that shallow two-pion bound states significantly affect the freeze-out, but did not establish whether such states actually form. In this work we demonstrate that a scalar isosinglet bound state does exist in a well-defined region of parameter space by solving an on-shell Lippmann--Schwinger equation in a chiral-unitary framework and analyzing the $S$-wave $\pi\pi$ amplitude in the complex energy plane. We determine the range of $m_\pi/f_\pi$ for which a pole appears below the two-pion threshold, extract the corresponding residue, and, in the non-relativistic limit, obtain the bound-state wave function at the origin, $|\Psi(0)|$, which controls bound-state-assisted annihilation and decay rates relevant for catalyzed freeze-out. Comparing this T-matrix based result with variational estimates using simple finite-range potentials, we find agreement within order-one factors for shallow binding. For binding energies of order the freeze-out temperature, $E_B \sim m_\pi/20$, we obtain $|\Psi(0)|\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)\,m_\pi^{3/2}$, thereby supporting the parametric assumptions used in previous phenomenological analyses.</description>

      <title>Superluminal constraints from ultra-high-energy neutrino events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sim 100\,$PeV neutrino detected by KM3NeT marks the beginning of ultra-high-energy neutrino astronomy and provides a powerful probe of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). In superluminal scenarios, neutrinos can decay through vacuum $e^-e^+$ pair emission or neutrino splitting. Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds. The survival-probability approximation adopted in previous works is therefore justified, while our framework provides a coherent basis for future analyses of superluminal neutrino constraints, which should consistently include possible time-delay signatures.</description>

      <title>Dark Photons in the Early Universe: From Thermal Production to Cosmological Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons, a generic class of light gauge bosons that interact with the Standard Model (SM) exclusively through kinetic mixing, arise naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4\pi e/27\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>Further study on the lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing with $S_{3L} \times S_{3R}$ flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments have confirmed that neutrinos are massive particles and lepton flavors are mixed. To explain the observed lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns, flavor symmetry plays a crucial and unique role. In this paper, we propose a useful symmetry-breaking scheme by applying $S_{3L} \times S_{3R} \rightarrow S_{2L} \times S_{2R} \rightarrow \emptyset$ within both charged-lepton and neutrino sectors at the mass-matrix level. For the three distinct residual subgroups $S_{2L}^{(23)} \times S_{2R}^{(23)}$, $S_{2L}^{(13)} \times S_{2R}^{(13)}$ and $S_{2L}^{(12)} \times S_{2R}^{(12)}$ under consideration, we systematically analyze the various parameterizations of the lepton mass matrices. It is shown that all the three scenarios are in good agreement with current neutrino oscillation data. Notably, within the latest best-fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters, the predicted Dirac CP-violating phase $\delta$ is calculated to be $294.6^\circ$, $302.3^\circ$ and $287.0^\circ$, respectively. To further assess the viability of the model, a comprehensive numerical analysis is performed by utilizing neutrino oscillation parameters at the $3\sigma$ level. It is found that the allowed range of $\delta$ is $281.2^\circ \rightarrow 338.7^\circ$, $287.0^\circ \rightarrow 342.2^\circ$ and $282.7^\circ \rightarrow 297.0^\circ$, all fall within its $3\sigma$ range. These results indicate that the proposed symmetry-breaking scheme $S_{3L} \times S_{3R} \rightarrow S_{2L} \times S_{2R} \rightarrow \emptyset$ can naturally explain the realistic lepton mass hierarchy and mixing pattern, thereby providing valuable theoretical perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Extraction of HQET Parameters from Inclusive Semi-Leptonic Decay of the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extract the non-perturbative Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) parameters from the inclusive semi-leptonic decay $\Lambda_c^+ \to X e^+ \nu_e$. Unlike charmed mesons produced near threshold, $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilation exhibit a complex momentum distribution, making the transformation of the electron energy spectrum from the laboratory frame to the $\Lambda_c^+$ rest frame non-trivial. To address this, we develop a novel Bayesian inference method to reconstruct the electron energy moments in the $\Lambda_c^+$ rest frame. By performing a global fit of theoretical predictions in the 1S mass scheme to these extracted moments, we determine the HQET parameters $\mu_{\pi}^2(\Lambda_c^+)$ and $\rho_D^3(\Lambda_c^+)$ for the first time using a purely data-driven approach.</description>

      <title>Removal of the Tachyons from the Fermionic Sector of the Quadratic ZX Action for the Exotic Model (E8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contains an encouraging result for the development of the Exotic Model (the `XM'). The XM is made from the Supersymmetric Standard Model (the `SSM') by coupling it to the `Exotic Invariant'. This rather unique `Exotic Invariant' is suggested by the detailed form of the SSM, combined with the detailed form of the BRS cohomology of SUSY.
  The motivation for examining the XM is that the usual SSM has some well-known, and serious, problems in its generally accepted, but unsatisfactory, SUSY breaking mechanism. That mechanism is based on the spontaneous breaking of SUSY.
  The Exotic Model avoids all of these problems, easily, because its SUSY splitting mechanism does not use, or need, any kind of spontaneous breaking of SUSY. The XM contains a mechanism for SUSY mass splitting because the addition of the Exotic Invariant modifies the algebra of SUSY. This paper is E8 in a series of papers denoted En, n= 1,2, ... all devoted to the XM. There is a lot of work still required to elucidate how the XM functions, and to see if the XM is really a viable alternative to the SSM. The first crucial question, raised in E7, is whether it is possible to constrain the initial XM action, so that the result excludes tachyonic excitations at tree level. If the XM is to be a viable theory, it is essential to first remove the tachyonic excitations, in a sensible way, from the fermionic and the bosonic sectors of the quadratic ZX action.
  This paper E8 explains how to remove the tachyons from the basic fermionic `ZX sector' at tree level. There are four fermion fields in this ZX sector. The removal requires that all of these fields have the same mass. This result is shown using a Mathematica notebook, which is issued with this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin and production mechanism of dark matter (DM) remain central questions in cosmology and particle physics. While thermal freeze-out has long dominated DM model building, alternative non-thermal scenarios are gaining prominence. In this work, we explore novel production channels for heavy DM candidates, including pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), Q-balls, and filtered DM arising from early-universe phenomena such as primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, superradiance, and first-order phase transitions. We demonstrate that these mechanisms naturally generate gravitational wave signals detectable by future observatories, such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji, and Cosmic Explorer. This multi-messenger approach offers a promising pathway to probe the origin and nature of DM beyond conventional paradigms.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in Production of Non-Abelian Millicharged Vector Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first predictive realization of vector freeze-in dark matter from a hidden non-Abelian gauge sector, spontaneously broken to a residual $U(1)$ with a massless dark photon mediator. A massive dark vector particle-antiparticle pair acquires small millicharges via a dimension-five kinetic mixing operator that induces a dimension-four mixing term with effective coefficient $\epsilon$, and interacts through the hidden gauge coupling $g_D$, linking it weakly to the Standard Model. Solving the relic abundance with a two-temperature Boltzmann evolution including plasmon decays, we find that $\epsilon, g_D \sim 10^{-7}$ reproduce the observed density while satisfying astrophysical and cosmological bounds. This minimal framework links non-Abelian vector dynamics, long-range dark forces, and dark matter, and can be testable with upcoming sub-GeV dark matter direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Collider Probes of Four-Lepton Final States in Maximally Flavor-Violating $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collider signatures of the maximally flavor-violating $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model, where a new gauge boson $Z^\prime$ and scalar triplets induce lepton flavor-changing interactions in the $\mu$-$\tau$ sector. Focusing on four-lepton final states at multi-TeV lepton colliders, we conduct a detailed analysis of cross sections, asymmetries, and polarization effects. We show that the signal cross section is highly sensitive to $m_{Z^\prime}$ and the effective parameters $\tilde{g}/m_{Z^\prime}$, while remaining largely insensitive to the triplet Yukawa couplings within the phenomenologically allowed region. The forward-backward asymmetry exhibits a characteristic monotonic dependence on $m_{Z^\prime}$, and beam polarization can significantly suppress Standard Model backgrounds while enhancing new physics contributions. We find that over the phenomenologically allowed parameter space, the predicted observables remain highly sensitive to the underlying model parameters. These results demonstrate that multi-lepton final states are powerful probes of the $U(1)_{L\mu - L_\tau}$ framework and offer valuable guidance for future searches at muon and electron-positron colliders.</description>

      <title>Systematic investigation of the spectroscopy and decay behaviors of doubly-charmed pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the discoveries of the $\Xi^{++}_{cc}(3621)$ and $T^{+}_{cc}(3875)$, we undertake a comprehensive investigation into the mass spectra, internal structures, and decay properties of doubly-charmed pentaquarks. By treating the two light quarks as a tightly bound diquark, the five-body system reduces to a four-body heavy quark-heavy quark-diquark-antiquark configuration. Within the constituent quark model framework, we calculate their mass spectra in the range of 4.7-5.4 GeV and corresponding internal mass contributions via the Gaussian expansion method. The root-mean-square radii, typically between 1.1-1.6 fm, indicate compact spatial structures. Furthermore, we also calculate the rearrangement decay widths via the quark-interchange model, finding that all states are unstable and decay into a singly-charmed baryon and a singly-charmed meson. Several narrow resonances have been identified, some of which have a total width even below 10 MeV. We hope that our study could provide valuable guidance for future theoretical investigations and experimental searches targeting doubly-charmed pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$-Meson Nucleon Scattering Length from Threshold Photoproduction on Light Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of recent SRC/CT Collaboration $J/\psi$ photoproduction data off a $^4$He target from Hall~D at Jefferson Laboratory, combined with the feasibility of measuring the reaction close to the free-nucleon energy threshold, opens the door to using incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction to access a variety of interesting physics aspects. An example is an estimate of the $J/\psi~p$ scattering length $|\alpha_{J/\psi~p}|$ on the bound proton obtained using the Vector Meson Dominance model. This value can be compared with that of the free proton from the GlueX Collaboration. One may then project what would be expected from the SRC/CT Collaboration Experiment E12--25--002, which was recently approved by the JLab PAC. Using a plane-wave theoretical model to generate quasi-data, we find the experiment could achieve a result of $|\alpha_{J/\psi~p}| = 3.08\pm 0.45~\mathrm{mfm}$, an uncertainty competitive with that of the free-proton measurement. A comparison between the two would allow an evaluation of the effects of medium modification in the case of light nuclei.</description>

      <title>The bound state of dark atom with the nucleus of substance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms offers a compelling framework to address the challenges in direct dark matter particles detection, as their neutral, atom-like configuration evades conventional experimental signatures. A critical issue may arise in interaction between $XHe$ and atomic nuclei due to the unshielded nuclear attraction, which could destabilize the dark atom's bound state. To resolve this, we propose a novel numerical quantum mechanical approach that accounts for self-consistent electromagnetic-nuclear couplings. This method addresses to eliminate the inherent complexity of the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, where analytical solutions are intractable. By reconstructing the effective interaction potential - including dipole Coulomb barrier and shallow potential well - we demonstrate how these features lead to the formation of $XHe$-nucleus bound states and modulate low-energy capture processes. Our model enables validation of the dark atom hypothesis, particularly in interpreting experimental anomalies like annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA. These findings advance the theoretical foundation for dark matter interactions and provide a robust framework for future experimental design.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the current Higgs excesses at the LHC in the 2HD+a framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several excesses of events in current LHC data, yet not exceeding the level of significance which would make them to be considered as firm. They point to the possibility of the presence of a new Higgs particle in the spectrum, in addition to the already observed 125 GeV state. In particular, there are excesses involving a diphoton resonance at invariant masses of about 95 GeV, 152 GeV and 650 GeV and an extra scalar might accompany the recent observation of a toponium at a mass of about 350 GeV. Several interpretations of these excesses have been attempted in extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, we aim to explain them in the framework of a two Higgs doublet model supplemented by a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs boson $a$ which would correspond to the putative resonance in most cases. This realistic 2HD+a scenario is attractive as it is has the virtue to pass all experimental constraints from high-precision experiments and collider searches and, at the same time, to allow for a viable explanation of the dark matter in the universe. We first update the present constraints on the model, in particular taking into account the latest results on dark matter and Higgs searches, as well the high-precision measurements, including those from Higgs and flavor physics. We then show that the additional Higgs states with the proper mass spectrum and adjusted couplings to fermions, would explain all the LHC excesses (but individually) while passing the former experimental constraints as well as the theoretical ones.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalization of general bosonic effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in quantum field theory is essential for phenomenological analyses in particle physics, and plays a significant role in the study of critical phenomena. We present a framework for renormalizing general bosonic effective field theories beyond one loop, with arbitrary gauge symmetry and scalar field content. In particular, we calculate the renormalization group equations in such theories up to two loops and dimension six. When specialized to the bosonic sector of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) using simple replacement rules, our general expressions reproduce recent results from the literature. Due to the broad applicability of effective field theory, our general results can readily be applied to obtain the anomalous dimensions in extensions of the bosonic SMEFT and in a plethora of other theories. We also envision our results to provide useful data on the scaling dimensions of composite operators in conformal field theories without fermions.</description>

      <title>New light mediators and the neutrino fog: Implications from XENONnT nuclear recoil data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current ton-scale, xenon-based dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments have now reached the sensitivity required to observe solar neutrinos, marking the onset of the so-called neutrino fog. In this work, we explore how this fog is modified when either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through a new scalar, vector, or axial-vector interaction, considering both heavy and light mediators. Using the latest nuclear-recoil data from XENONnT, which show indications of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8$B solar neutrinos, we derive new strong bounds on light mediator couplings. We find that these limits are significantly more stringent when the mediator couples to DM, rather than when new physics affects only neutrino interactions. Building on these results, we recompute the expected neutrino fog and compare it with the corresponding constraints on spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon interactions. We show that the morphology of the neutrino fog can be markedly modified if either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through light mediators, even in light of these recent constraints.</description>

      <title>Update of the nonlocal sub-leading ${O}_1$-${O}_7$ contribution to $\bar B \to X_s \gamma$ at LO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In all previous calculations of the non-local sub-leading contribution to the inclusive penguin decay $\bar B \to X_s \gamma$ due to the interference of the electroweak operators ${O}_1^c$ - ${O}_{7\gamma}$ the local Voloshin term was subtracted. In view of the ongoing analysis at order $\alpha_s$, we present a calculation of the complete non-local contribution which takes into account the high correlation between the uncertainties of the local Voloshin and the non-local term of the previous analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the parity-odd part of the Weyl anomaly for chiral fermions in a background gravitational field. We start from a manifestly real form of the Lagrangian (that is, not only real up to a total derivative), and we regularize it by means of Pauli-Villars fermions. All parity-odd terms in the anomaly cancel in the integrand, so that the result of the anomaly is necessarily parity-even.</description>

      <title>Open Effective Field Theory and the Physics of Cosmological Collider Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the origin of the cosmological collider signal using the framework of open effective field theories. Focusing on the single exchange of a massive scalar field, we demonstrate that the trispectrum splits cleanly into its local and non-local components once the heavy-field propagators are decomposed in the Keldysh basis. Integrating out the massive degree of freedom yields a single-field effective field theory for the light scalar that necessarily contains both unitary operators and non-unitary contributions associated with dissipation and stochastic noise. We show that the leading local signal in parity-preserving theories arises from the unitary part of this effective field theory, whereas the non-local signal is intrinsically associated with its stochastic sector. The effective field theory coefficients themselves are a priori non-analytic in the external kinematics; however, this non-analyticity can be softened when a scale hierarchy - such as the heavy-mass expansion - is imposed, up to spurious contributions that ultimately cancel in observables. Finally, we establish a connection between the cosmological collider signal and entropy production, linking the observable non-local signal to intrinsic properties of the quantum state, including its degree of mixedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the Covariant Derivative Expansion, we develop a method to compute effective actions that is able to capture non-perturbative effects induced by strong background fields. We demonstrate the method in scalar QED, by deriving the full second-derivative corrections to the scalar Heisenberg--Euler effective action. The corresponding result is interpreted as an effective field theory with three characteristic scales, two of which are large (mass and field strength) in comparison with the remaining one (derivatives of the field). As an application, we show that, at this order, the transseries structure of the Schwinger pair production rate is preserved, even if the involved coefficients are modified. Our analysis also helps clarify recent disagreements concerning the coefficients of this effective action.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with particular emphasis on the effect of spin on the deconfinement phase transition and star properties. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state with a phase transition from hadronic matter containing hyperons to color-superconducting quark matter, where the quark phase is modeled within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the strength of the vector repulsion and diquark pairing couplings in the microscopic quark Lagrangian, we construct a set of hybrid star sequences with different quark-matter onset densities. This framework ensures consistency with astrophysical and gravitational wave constraints on mass, radius, and tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Isocurvature Induced Gravitational Waves at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are powerful probes of new physics in the early Universe. In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data. Our results set stringent constraints on isocurvature around $10^{6}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which are complementary to cosmological observations at large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the composite models of gravity and investigate how dynamical tensor fields emerge by utilizing the functional Renormalization Group. In this paper, we consider two models: One is the fermionic theory. Another is the scalar theory. In both cases, we introduce an auxiliary tensor field corresponding to a composite field of the energy-momentum tensor by means of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. We derive the flow equations for the field renormalization factors of the auxiliary tensor field and show the tensor field becomes dynamical in the infrared regime. The resulting kinetic terms are interpreted as gauge-fixed terms.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass constraints in the context of 4-parameter dark energy equation of state and DESI DR2 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, are strongly shaped by assumptions about the dark-energy equation of state due to the well-known degeneracy between massive neutrinos and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.101$ eV ($95\%$ C.L.). This upper limit is more stringent than the DESI DR2 constraint obtained within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. From the best-fit parameters, we reconstruct the evolution of the 4pDE equation of state along with both $68\%$ and $95\%$C.L. We do not find a statistically significant phantom-crossing at $z \sim 0.5$, consistent with the conclusion from the DESI collaboration; at higher redshifts, the reconstructed $w(z)$ follows the CPL evolution and deviates only at low redshift. Additionally we also find reduction in $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}=-7.3$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Backwards Gamma-Ray Bursts: Searching for Exploding Primordial Black Holes in Short-Duration GRB Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $\gamma$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.</description>

      <title>Neutrino pair bremsstrahlung due to electromagnetic collisions in neutron star cores revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the problem of neutrino pair bremsstrahlung emission originating from the electromagnetic collisions of charged particles in nucleonic ($npe\mu$) neutron star cores. Two limiting cases are considered: (i) protons are in the normal state and (ii) protons are in the superconducting state. In both cases, the dominant contribution to the bremsstrahlung emissivity $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ comes from the transverse part of in-medium electromagnetic interactions. For non-superconducting matter, we obtain an unusual $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{23/3}$ temperature dependence due to the dynamical character of plasma screening in the transverse channel, but considerably smaller values of $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ than in previous studies, rendering the considered process unimportant in practice. In contrast, for superconducting and superfluid matter, the neutrino emission processes involving nucleons are suppressed and $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ due to lepton collisions provides the residual contribution to the neutrino emissivity of neutron star core matter. In the superconducting case, the plasma screening becomes static and the standard $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{8}$ temperature scaling is restored. Simple analytical expressions for $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ in both limiting cases are provided.</description>

      <title>The Strong-$CP$ Problem and its Gauge Axion solution as Evidence for Fundamental Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological susceptibility of the QCD vacuum provides an understanding of $\theta$-vacua as vacua of a Chern-Simons gauge theory. In this way, it gives an immediate proof of the physicality of the boundary $\theta$-term. This makes the essence of the strong-$CP$ puzzle very transparent and offers a solution in form of the gauge axion, which has exact quality. This axion represents an intrinsic part of the QCD gauge redundancy without any reference to an anomalous global symmetry. It is a two-form transforming under the QCD gauge symmetry. Due to its pure gauge nature, the gauge axion represents a powerful tool to monitor physics of $\theta$-vacua in various regimes. Unlike the ordinary Peccei-Quinn axion, which is UV-completed into a Goldstone phase of a complex scalar and thereby suffers from the quality problem, the gauge axion is UV-completed directly into a fundamental theory of gravity. We study the domain wall and string structure of the gauge axion and show that the strings sourcing it must be a part of this fundamental theory. We thus observe that the absence of the axion quality problem motivates the presence of fundamental strings. This provides a new argument for a connection between the axion and gravity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the leading-power fragmentation of fully charmed pentaquark states ($S$-wave $|c\bar{c}ccc\rangle$ pentacharms) at hadron colliders. We introduce a new set of multimodal collinear fragmentation functions, named PQ5Q1.0. They rely on an enhanced calculation of the initial-scale input for the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel, making them well suited to describe the short-distance emission of either a compact multicharm state or a dicharm-charm-dicharm configuration. To explore phenomenological implications, we use the (sym)JETHAD multimodular interface to study NLL/NLO$^+$ semi-inclusive production rates for pentacharm-plus-jet systems at the forthcoming HL-LHC and the future FCC. Our analysis represents a further step toward bridging the domains of hadronic structure, precision QCD, and exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Supersymmetric Dark Matter for the origin of KM3NeT Ultra-High Energy signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an explanation for the recently reported ultra-high-energy neutrino signal at KM3NeT, which shows no clear association with known astrophysical sources. While decaying dark matter in the Galactic Center is a natural candidate, the observed arrival direction strongly suggests an extragalactic origin. We introduce a multicomponent dark matter scenario in which the components are part of a supermultiplet, with supersymmetry ensuring a nearly degenerate mass spectrum among the fields with different spins. In this setup, a cosmologically long-lived fermionic state decays into a slightly lighter bosonic dark matter state, producing a boosted neutrino spectrum with energy $E_\nu \sim 100$ PeV, determined by the mass difference. The heavy-to-light decay occurs at a cosmological redshift of $z \sim \text{a few}$ or higher, leading to an isotropic directional distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>Indications for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark mass effects in charged-current deep-inelastic scattering at approximate NNLO in the Aivazis-Collins-Olness-Tung scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approximate SACOT-$\chi$ scheme for heavy quark production in deep-inelastic scattering was initially formulated for the neutral current structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$. We extend this approach to the charged current case (also including $F_3$), and thereby complete the definitions for the most relevant inclusive structure functions. Furthermore, we implement these structure functions in the open-source code $\texttt{APFEL++}$ which provides fast numerical evaluations over a wide kinematic range; this addition to the $\texttt{APFEL++}$ code is publicly available, with details provided in the appendix. This SACOT-$\chi$ implementation enables, for the first time, detailed numerical insights on the mass dependence of the structure functions and cross sections in the $(x,Q^2)$-plane for both neutral and charged current processes. We consider kinematic regions relevant for the experimental measurements from fixed-target $\nu$DIS experiments (NuTeV, CCFR and Chorus) and HERA, and also projections for the upcoming EIC. In particular, the $\nu$DIS experiments reveal a surprisingly strong dependence on the mass effects, offering valuable insights that may help resolve long-standing challenges in accurately describing these datasets.</description>

      <title>Investigating nuclear effects in lepton-ion DIS at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the far-forward physics program of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be useful to probe the hadron structure with GeV-TeV neutrinos and muons. In particular, these studies indicate that the measurement of the muon-ion and neutrino-ion cross-sections by the same experiment is feasible. In this paper, we investigate the impact of nuclear effects on the muon-tungsten ($\mu W$) and neutrino-tungsten ($\nu W$) deep inelastic scattering (DIS) events at FASER$\nu$ and its proposed upgrade FASER$\nu 2$. We estimate the rates associated with the inclusive cross-sections and for events with a charm tagged in the final state considering different parameterizations for the nuclear parton distribution functions. These results point out that muon and neutrino-induced interactions probe complementary kinematical ranges and that a simultaneous analysis of associated events will allow to test the universality (or not) of the nuclear effects. Moreover, we propose the study of the ratio between the charm tagged and inclusive events in order to discriminate between the distinct modeling of the nuclear effects at small-$x$. Our results indicate that a future experimental reconstruction of $\mu W$ and $\nu W$ DIS events at the LHC is a promising way to improve our understanding of nuclear effects and decrease the current uncertainties in parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions; results are shown to be comparable to quasiparticle bound states in gapped Dirac materials. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion field {\psi} becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion field strength. For sufficiently large {\psi} and low velocity, the collision of two m = 1 vortices results in a pseudostable m= 2 bound state that eventually becomes unstable and decays back into two m= 1 vortices. For large {\psi} and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.</description>

Abstract: We document the three main new features in the v2 release series of the HOPPET parton distribution function evolution code, specifically support for N$^3$LO QCD evolution in the variable flavour number scheme, for the determination of hadronic structure functions for massless quarks up to N$^3$LO, and for QED evolution to an accuracy phenomenologically equivalent to NNLO QCD. Additionally we describe a new Python interface, CMake build option, functionality to save a hoppet table as an LHAPDF grid and update our performance benchmarks, including optimisations in interpolating PDF tables.</description>

      <title>Coherent and incoherent antineutrino scattering on stable even-even isotopes of molybdenum detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observations of the coherent neutrino- and antineutrino-nucleus scattering have opened up a plethora of opportunities to probe physics within standard and non-standard theories of the electroweak interactions. In the present article, our goal is to explore the possibility of using the molybdenum material as detection medium for coherent and incoherent antineutrino- and neutrino- Mo scattering in the ongoing and future coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE{\nu}NS) experiments by using relevant (anti-)neutrino beams as e.g. stopped pion-decay neutrino beams, reactor antineutrino beams, astrophysical (solar or supernova) (anti)neutrino beams, etc. Our present coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections of Mo isotopes with neutrinos and antineutrinos are based on the deformed shell model (DSM) that has been previously employed for studying similar processes. On the other hand, in the past, CE{\nu}NS events obtained with this model provided us with better fits to COHERENT experimental data compared to phenomenological form factors.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV Dark Matter Physics with Cosmic Ray and Future Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If sub-GeV Dark matter(DM) annihilates to the charged particles such as $e^+ e^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^-$, or $\pi^+ \pi^-$, it generates an additional source of electrons and positrons in the cosmic ray (CR) population within our Milky Way. During propagation, these secondary electrons and positrons undergo reacceleration processes, boosting their energies to the GeV scale. Observatories like AMS-02 can detect these high-energy particles, enabling constraints on the properties of sub-GeV DM. By analyzing AMS-02 electron and positron data, the 95\% upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section have been established in the range of $10^{-28}$ to $10^{-27}$ cm$^3\,$s$^{-1}$, corresponding to DM masses ranging from 100 MeV to 1 GeV. Meanwhile, MeV telescopes will provide complementary constraints on DM properties by detecting photon emissions from such annihilation processes. Notably, the sensitivity of future MeV gamma-ray observatories is projected to approach or match the constraints derived from CR data.</description>

      <title>Isotropy Test with Quasars Using Method of Smoothed Residuals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To assess the significance and scale dependence of anomalous large scale modes in the CatWISE quasar data, we generate smoothed number density fields on the sphere and study their extreme values -- maximum, minimum, maximum antipodal difference. By comparing these summary statistics to those obtained from random isotropic realisations of the data, we determine the statistical significance of large scale modes as a function of smoothing scale. We perform our analysis using five different versions of the data -- the original quasar map, the maps after separately subtracting the ecliptic bias and the CMB dipole, the map obtained after subtracting both, and the map after subtracting the ecliptic bias and anomalous dipole inferred in \cite{Secrest2021}. We find that the ecliptic-corrected, CMB dipole-removed map exhibits large scale modes that are in tension with random realisations of the data (p-values $p \lesssim 10^{-4}$), over a wide range of smoothing scales $\pi/8 \leq \delta \leq \pi/2$. The most prominent feature in the data is an under-density in the southern galactic plane at $(b,\ell) = (-31^\circ,78^\circ)$, which reaches its highest statistical significance when smoothed on scales $\delta = \pi/6$ ($p = 1.2 \times 10^{-6}$). Notably, the minima statistics align with the maximum antipodal difference statistics, whereas the maxima do not. This suggests that the observed dipole-like behavior in the data is primarily driven by the under-density in the southern sky. The ecliptic corrected, anomalous dipole subtracted map reduces the significance of any residual anisotropic features, but an under-density in the south sky persists with p-value $p =0.0018$.</description>

      <title>Shapes and orientations of massive halos in the statistically anisotropic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how statistical anisotropy (SA) in matter distributions affects the distributions of shapes and orientations of cluster-sized halos, using cosmological $N$-body simulations that incorporate SA. While the three-dimensional halo shape parameters show little dependence on SA, we find that halo orientations are significantly influenced, with halos tending to align either perpendicular or parallel to the SA direction. This SA-induced alignment becomes more prominent for more massive halos. We also study other vector quantities associated with the dynamics of halos, such as bulk velocity and angular momentum vectors. We find that their dependences on the SA are smaller than those of the orientation vectors. Our findings suggest that observational measurements of projected halo shapes derived from galaxy cluster-galaxy lensing could provide a novel probe of SA in the universe.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of meson masses and low-energy constants in large-$N$ QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$, the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling $\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$ channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$ results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is secondarily and inevitably induced by the primordial curvature perturbations beyond the first order of the cosmological perturbation theory. We analytically calculate the integration kernel of the power spectrum of the induced GWs, which is the universal part independent of the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, in the radiation-dominated era and in the matter-dominated era. We derive fully analytic expressions of the GW spectrum when possible. As a minor update, we study the case of the top-hat function as the spectrum of the curvature perturbations. We also discuss generalization in the presence of multiple cosmological eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from stars in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.</description>

      <title>Annual-modulation fingerprint of the axion wind induced sideband triplet in quantum dot spin qubit sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise, including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component. For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise. Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Is The Trace Anomaly at its Minimum Value at Neutron Star Centers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</description>

      <title>A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13666</link>

Abstract: Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</description>
