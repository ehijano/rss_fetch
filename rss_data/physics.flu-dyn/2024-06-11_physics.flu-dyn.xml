      <title>Microfluidic front dynamic for the characterization of pumps for long-term autonomous microsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate the use and portability of Lab on a chip technology, it is desirable to avoid the use of bulky electronic systems for flow control. Developed self-powered microsystems typically move only small volumes of fluid performing up to one or two hours. We have previously shown that polymeric micropumps combined with plastic microfluidic cartridges constitute a universal self-powered modular microfluidic architecture suitable for moving large volumes of fluids in short times. Herein, we show that polymeric micropumps can provide self-powered flow control for long periods of time in the range of hours and days. The calibration curves of various types of micropumps were obtained including one that maintained the movement of the fluid for 23 hours, advancing the fluid front up to 1.8 meters through a channel with a section of 0.127 mm2. We found that the actuation time of the pump was related to degassing time, the effective surface area and the air recovery rate of the pump. This is the first example of a long operating self-powered microsystem, which may have a great impact in those cases where controlled flow is needed for a long period of time and the use of electronic equipment is not desirable.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods for Coastal-Trapped Waves and Instabilities in a Background Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a numerical method for finding non-hydrostatic coastal-trapped wave and instability solutions to the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations in the presence of a background flow and complicated coastal topography. We use spectral methods to discretise the two-dimensional eigenvalue problem and solve the resulting discrete problem by standard methods. Our approach is applied to three examples and shown to be consistent with previous numerical and analytical results. In particular, we show that our method is able to reliably identify coastal-trapped wave solutions that correspond to waves seen in realistic simulations of the Southeast Greenland shelf.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium fluctuations of the direct cascade in Surface Quasi Geostrophic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the temporal fluctuations of the flux of surface potential energy in Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) turbulence. By means of high-resolution, direct numerical simulations of the SQG model in the regime of forced and dissipated cascade of temperature variance, we show that the instantaneous imbalance in the energy budget originates a subleading correction to the spectrum of the turbulent cascade. Using a multiple-scale approach combined with a dimensional closure we derive a theoretical prediction for the power-law behavior of the corrections, which holds for a class of turbulent transport equations known as {\alpha}-turbulence. Further, we develop and apply a method to disentangle the equilibrium and non-equilibrium contribution in the instantaneous spectra, which can be generalized to other turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of nonlinearity on Anderson localization of surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is a multiple-scattering phenomenon of linear waves propagating within a disordered medium. Discovered in the late 50s for electrons, it has since been observed experimentally with cold atoms and with classical waves (optics, microwaves, and acoustics), but whether wave localization is enhanced or weakened for nonlinear waves is a long-standing debate. Here, we show that the nonlinearity strengthens the localization of surface-gravity waves propagating in a canal with a random bottom. We also show experimentally how the localization length depends on the nonlinearity, which has never been reported previously with any type of wave. To do so, we use a full space-and-time-resolved wavefield measurement as well as numerical simulations. The effects of the disorder level and the system's finite size on localization are also reported. We also highlight the first experimental evidence of the macroscopic analog of Bloch's dispersion relation of linear hydrodynamic surface waves over periodic bathymetry.</description>

      <title>On smooth and peaked traveling waves in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Boltzmann Equation for Complex Systems of Neutral Gases across All Flow Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Tropical Pacific Upper Ocean using Online Data Assimilation with a Deep Learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep learning (DL) model, based on a transformer architecture, is trained on a climate-model dataset and compared with a standard linear inverse model (LIM) in the tropical Pacific. We show that the DL model produces more accurate forecasts compared to the LIM when tested on a reanalysis dataset. We then assess the ability of an ensemble Kalman filter to reconstruct the monthly-averaged upper ocean from a noisy set of 24 sea-surface temperature observations designed to mimic existing coral proxy measurements, and compare results for the DL model and LIM. Due to signal damping in the DL model, we implement a novel inflation technique by adding noise from hindcast experiments. Results show that assimilating observations with the DL model yields better reconstructions than the LIM for observation averaging times ranging from one month to one year. The improved reconstruction is due to the enhanced predictive capabilities of the DL model, which map the memory of past observations to future assimilation times.</description>

      <title>Modeling fibrous tissue in vascular fluid-structure interaction: a morphology-based pipeline and biomechanical significance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a suite of technologies for analyzing the interaction between anisotropic arterial walls and blood flow for subject-specific geometries. Utilizing an established lumen modeling strategy, we present a comprehensive pipeline for generating the thick-walled artery models. Through a specialized mesh generation procedure, we obtain the meshes for the arterial lumen and wall with mesh continuity across the interface ensured. Exploiting the centerline information, a series of procedures is introduced for generating local basis vectors within the arterial wall. The procedures are tailored to handle thick-walled and, in particular, aneurysmatic tissues in which the basis vectors may exhibit transmural variations. Additionally, we propose methods to accurately identify the centerline in multi-branched vessels and bifurcating regions. The developed fiber generation method is evaluated against the strategy using linear elastic analysis, demonstrating that the proposed approach yields satisfactory fiber definitions in the considered benchmark. Finally, we examine the impact of anisotropic arterial wall models on the vascular fluid-structure interaction analysis through numerical examples. For comparison purposes, the neo-Hookean model is considered. The first case involves an idealized curved geometry, while the second case studies an image-based abdominal aorta model. The numerical results reveal that the deformation and stress distribution are critically related to the constitutive model of the wall, while the hemodynamic factors are less sensitive to the wall model. This work paves the way for more accurate image-based vascular modeling and enhances the prediction of arterial behavior under physiologically realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate evaluation of Biot-Savart integrals over spatial curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Biot-Savart law is relevant in physical contexts including electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. In the latter case, when the rotation of a fluid is confined to a set of very thin vortex filaments, this law describes the velocity field induced by the spatial arrangement of these objects. The Biot-Savart law is at the core of vortex methods used in the simulation of classical and quantum fluid flows. Naive methods are inefficient when dealing with large numbers of vortex elements, which makes them inadequate for simulating turbulent vortex flows. Here we exploit a direct analogy between the Biot-Savart law and electrostatics to adapt Ewald summation methods, routinely used in molecular dynamics simulations, to vortex filament simulations in three-dimensional periodic domains. In this context, the basic idea is to split the induced velocity onto (i) a coarse-grained velocity generated by a Gaussian-filtered vorticity field, and (ii) a short-range correction accounting for near-singular behaviour near the vortices. The former component can be accurately and efficiently evaluated using the nonuniform fast Fourier transform algorithm. Analytical accuracy estimates are provided as a function of the parameters entering the method. We also discuss how to properly account for the finite vortex core size in kinetic energy estimations. Using numerical experiments, we verify the accuracy and the conservation properties of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate the $O(N \log N)$ complexity of the method over a wide range of problem sizes $N$, considerably better than the $O(N^2)$ cost of a naive approach.</description>

      <title>The impact of finite span and wing-tip vortices on a turbulent NACA0012 wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations are conducted to investigate the turbulent boundary layers around a finite-span NACA0012 wing with a rounded wing-tip geometry at a chord-based Reynolds number of $Re_c=200\,000$ and at various angles of attack up to $10^\circ$. The study aims to discern the differences between the boundary layers on the finite-span wing and those on infinite-span wings at equivalent angles of attack. The finite-span boundary layers exhibit: (i) an altered streamwise and a non-zero spanwise pressure gradient as a result of the variable downwash induced by the wing-tip vortices (an inviscid effect typical of finite-span wings); (ii) differences in the flow history at different wall-normal distances, caused by the variable flow angle in the wall-normal direction (due to constant pressure gradients and variable momentum normal to the wall); (iii) laminar flow entrainment into the turbulent boundary layers near the wing tip (due to a laminar/turbulent interface); and (iv) variations in boundary layer thickness across the span, attributed to the variable wall-normal velocity in that direction (a primarily inviscid effect). These physical effects are then used to explain the differences in the Reynolds stress profiles and other boundary layer quantities, including the reduced near-wall peak of the streamwise Reynolds stress and the elevated Reynolds stress levels near the boundary layer edge, both observed in the finite-span wings. Other aspects of the flow, such as the downstream development of wing-tip vortices and their interactions with the surrounding flow, are reserved for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Transient growth in diabatic boundary layers with fluids at supercritical pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the region close to the thermodynamic critical point and in the proximity of the pseudo-boiling (Widom) line, strong property variations substantially alter the growth of modal instabilities, as revealed in Ren et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 871, 2019, pp. 831-864). Here, we study non-modal disturbances in the spatial framework using an eigenvector decomposition of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations under the assumption of locally parallel flow. The boundary layers with the fluid at supercritical pressure are heated or cooled by prescribing the wall and free-stream temperatures so that the temperature profile is either entirely subcritical (liquid-like), supercritical (gas-like), or transcritical (across the Widom line). The free-stream Mach number is set to $10^{-3}$. In the non-transcritical regimes, the resulting streamwise-independent streaks originate from the lift-up effect. Wall cooling enhances the energy amplification for both subcritical and supercritical regimes. When the temperature profile is increased beyond the Widom line, a strong sub-optimal growth is observed over very short streamwise distances due to the Orr mechanism. The non-modal growth is put in perspective with modal growth by means of an $N$-factor comparison. In the non-transcritical regimes, modal stability dominates regardless of a wall-temperature variation. In contrast, in the transcritical regime, non-modal $N$-factors are found to resemble the imposition of an adverse pressure gradient in the ideal-gas regime. When cooling beyond the Widom line, optimal growth is greatly enhanced, yet strong inviscid instability prevails. When heating beyond the Widom line, optimal growth could be sufficiently large to favor transition, particularly with a high free-stream turbulence level.</description>

      <title>Equatorial blowup and polar caps in drop electrohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illuminate effects of surface-charge convection intrinsic to leaky-dielectric electrohydrodynamics by analyzying the symmetric steady state of a circular drop in an external field at arbitrary electric Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}_E$. In formulating the problem, we identify an exact factorization that reduces the number of dimensionless parameters from four -- $\mathrm{Re}_E$ and the conductivity, permittivity and viscosity ratios -- to two: a modified electric Reynolds number $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ and a charging parameter $\varpi$. In the case $\varpi&lt;0$, where charge relaxation in the drop phase is slower than in the suspending phase, and, as a consequence, the interface polarizes antiparallel to the external field, we find that above a critical $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ value the solution exhibits a blowup singularity such that the surface-charge density diverges antisymmetrically with the $-1/3$ power of distance from the equator. We use local analysis to uncover the structure of that blowup singularity, wherein surface charges are convected by a locally induced flow towards the equator where they annihilate. To study the blowup regime, we devise a numerical scheme encoding that local structure where the blowup prefactor is determined by a global charging -- annihilation balance. We also employ asymptotic analysis to construct a universal problem governing the blowup solutions in the regime $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}\gg1$, far beyond the blowup threshold. In the case $\varpi&gt;0$, where charge relaxation is faster in the drop phase and the interface polarizes parallel to the external field, we numerically observe and asymptotically characterize the formation at large $\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}$ of stagnant, perfectly conducting surface-charge caps about the drop poles.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>A finite element method to compute the damping rate and frequency of oscillating fluids inside microfluidic nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computation of damping rates of an oscillating fluid with a free surface in which viscosity is small and surface tension high is numerically challenging. A typical application requiring such computation is drop-on-demand (DoD) microfluidic devices that eject liquid metal droplets, where accurate knowledge of damping rates for the least-damped oscillation modes following droplet ejection is paramount for assessing jetting stability at higher jetting frequencies. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often struggle to accurately predict meniscus damping unless a very fine discretization is adopted, so calculations are computationally expensive. The faster alternative we adopt is to compute damping rates directly from the eigenvalues of the linearized problem. The surface tension term in Stokes or sloshing problems requires approximation of meniscus displacements, which introduces additional complexity in their numerical solution. We consider the combined effects of viscosity and surface tension, approximate the meniscus displacements, and construct a finite element method to compute the fluid's oscillation modes. We prove that the method is free of spurious modes with zero or positive damping rates, and we implement it with Taylor-Hood elements for velocity and pressure, and with continuous piecewise quadratic elements for meniscus displacement. We verify the numerical convergence of the method by reproducing the solution to an analytical benchmark problem and two more complex examples with axisymmetric geometry. We obtain the spatial shape and temporal evolution (angular frequency and damping rate) of the set of least-damped oscillation modes in minutes, compared to days for a CFD simulation. The method's ability to quickly generate accurate estimates of fluid oscillation damping rates makes it suitable for integration into design loops for prototyping microfluidic nozzles.</description>
