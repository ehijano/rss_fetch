      <title>Near-surface Defects Break Symmetry in Water Adsorption on CeO$_{2-x}$(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.</description>

      <title>Confined acoustic phonons in CsPbI3 nanocrystals explored by resonant Raman scattering on excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of the lead halide perovskites nanocrystals are controlled by confined excitons and rich spectrum of confined acoustic and optical phonons. We study experimentally and theoretically the exciton-phonon interaction in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Energies of phonon modes allowed by selection rules are detected by resonant Raman scattering for nanocrystals with sizes of 4-13 nm, covering exciton energies of 1.72-2.25 eV. While optical phonon energies remain size-independent, the energies of confined acoustic phonons increase in smaller nanocrystals. Acoustic phonons are modeled within the continuum approximation using elastic constants computed by density functional theory. The model provides the energy spectra of confined phonons for nanocrystals of various shapes (cube, sphere, spheroid), crystal symmetries (orthorhombic and tetragonal), and sizes. Exciton confinement restricts efficient coupling to only few phonon modes observable in Raman spectra. By comparing experimental data with model predictions, we conclude that the nanocrystals in our samples predominantly have spherical or spheroidal shapes.</description>

      <title>Photocurrents induced by k-linear terms in semiconductors and semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a six-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ model to describe the electronic structure and optical response of chiral multifold semimetals, such as RhSi. By means of invariants method we construct the effective Hamiltonian describing the states near the $\Gamma$-point of the Brillouin zone where the spin-orbit coupling and $\mathbf{k}$-linear Rashba terms, which are crucial for circular photogalvanic effect, are taken into account. The model is parameterized using tight-binding calculations. We compute the interband absorption spectrum, showing a linear-in-frequency dependence at low energies and a resonant feature near the spin-orbit splitting energy. Furthermore, we calculate the circular photogalvanic effect. In agreement with previous works the current generation rate at low frequencies exhibits a quantized low-frequency response, governed by the universal value $|\mathcal{C}| = 4$ for the effective topological charge. Our results provide an analytical framework for understanding the role of Rashba coupling and topology in the optoelectronic properties of multifold chiral semimetals.</description>
