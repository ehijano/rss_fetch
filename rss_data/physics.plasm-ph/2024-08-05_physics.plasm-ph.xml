      <title>Magnetic reconnection and plasma transport in the presence of plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence can enhance the diffusion of both magnetic fields and plasmas. But, any theory must be consistent with their evolution equations having the mathematical form of advection-diffusion equations. Advection-diffusion equations have a remarkable feature. When the diffusion is extremely weak but non-zero, its magnitude makes only a small difference even when varied over sixteen orders of magnitude. This is true when the advective velocity is chaotic -- the exponential separation of neighboring streamlines -- as natural flows generally are. Even highly turbulent flows have in addition to eddies large-scale coherent flows, such as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic, which dominates their transport effects on longest scales. Basic physics and easily understood mathematics place important constraints, which are explained.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effect of turbulent fluctuations on the onset of reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless plasmas is one of the most outstanding open questions in plasma physics. Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are two phenomena that can produce the conditions for energy dissipation. These two phenomena are closely related to each other in a wide range of plasmas. Turbulent fluctuations can emerge in critical regions of reconnection events, and magnetic reconnection can occur as a product of the turbulent cascade. In this study, we perform 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a reconnecting Harris current sheet in the presence of turbulent fluctuations to explore the effect of turbulence on the reconnection process in collisionless non-relativistic pair-plasmas. We find that the presence of a turbulent field can affect the onset and evolution of magnetic reconnection. Moreover, we observe the existence of a scale dependent amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations above which these fluctuations are able to disrupt the growing of magnetic islands. These fluctuations provide thermal energy to the particles within the current sheet and preferential perpendicular thermal energy to the background population.</description>

      <title>Access and sustainment of ELMy H-mode operation for ITER Pre-Fusion Power Operation plasmas using JINTRAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the initial stages of ITER operation, ELM mitigation systems need to be commissioned. This requires controlled flat-top operation in type-I ELMy H-mode regimes. Hydrogen or helium plasma discharges are used exclusively in these stages to ensure negligible production of neutrons from fusion reactions. With the expected higher L-H power threshold of hydrogen and helium plasmas compared to corresponding D and D/T plasmas, it is uncertain whether available auxiliary power systems are sufficient to operate in stable type-I ELMy H-mode. This has been investigated using integrated core and edge/SOL/divertor modelling with JINTRAC. Assuming that the L-H power threshold is well captured by the Martin08 scaling law, the presented simulations have found that 30 MW of ECRH power is likely required for the investigated hydrogen plasma scenarios, rather than the originally planned 20 MW in the 2016 Staged Approach ITER Baseline. However, past experiments have shown that a small helium fraction (~10 %) can considerably reduce the hydrogen plasma L-H power threshold. Assuming that these results extrapolate to ITER operation regimes, the 7.5MA/2.65T hydrogen plasma scenario is likely to access stable type-I ELMy H-mode operation also at 20 MW of ECRH.</description>

      <title>An upper critical dimension for dynamo action: A $d$-dimensional closure model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a $d$-dimensional Eddy Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian (EDQNM) Closure Model to study dynamo action in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we find lower $d_L$ and upper $d_U$ critical dimensions for sustained dynamo action in this incompressible problem. Our model is adaptable for future studies incorporating helicity, compressible effects and a wide range of magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and ion heating in 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform 3D3V hybrid-Vlasov simulations of turbulence with quasi-isotropic, compressible injection near ion scales to mimic the Earth's magnetosheath plasma, and investigate the novel electron-only reconnection, recently observed by the NASA's MMS mission, and its impact on ion heating. Retaining electron inertia in the generalized Ohm s law enables collisionless magnetic reconnection. Spectral analysis shows a shift from kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAW) to inertial kinetic Alfv\'en (IKAW) and inertial whistler waves (IWW) near electron scales. To distinguish the roles of inertial scale and gyroradius ($d_{\rm{i}}$ and $\rho_{\rm{i}}$), three ion beta ($\beta_{\rm{i}} = 0.25, 1, 4$) values are studied. Ion-electron decoupling increases with $\beta_{\rm{i}}$, as ions become less mobile when the injection scale is closer to $\rho_{\rm{i}}$ than $d_{\rm{i}}$, highlighting the role of $\rho_{\rm{i}}$ in achieving an electron magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) regime at sub-ion scales. This regime promotes electron-only reconnection in turbulence with small-scale injection at $\beta_{\rm{i}} \gtrsim 1$. We observe significant ion heating even at large $\beta_{\rm{i}}$, with $Q_{\rm{i}}/\epsilon \approx 69\%, 91\%, 96\%$ at $\beta_{\rm{i}} = 0.25, 1, 4$ respectively. While ion heating is anisotropic at $\beta_{\rm{i}} \leq 1$ ($T_{\rm i,\perp} &gt; T_{\rm i,\parallel}$), it is marginally anisotropic at $\beta_{\rm{i}} &gt; 1$ ($T_{\rm i,\perp} \gtrsim T_{\rm i,\parallel}$). These findings have implications for other collisionless astrophysical environments, like high-$\beta$ plasmas in intracluster medium, where processes such as micro-instabilities or shocks may inject energy near ion-kinetic scales.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic windings, surface helicity and their applications in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, J. Parsley, J. Geom. Phys. 60:1127 (2010)] Cantarella and Parsley introduced the notion of submanifold helicity. In the present paper we investigate properties of surface helicity and in particular answer two open questions posed in the aforementioned work: (i) We give a precise mathematically rigorous physical interpretation of surface helicity in terms of linking of distinct field lines. (ii) We prove that surface helicity is non-trivial if and only if the underlying surface has non-trivial topology (i.e. at least one hole).
  We then focus on toroidal surfaces which are of relevance in plasma physics and express surface helicity in terms of average poloidal and toroidal windings of the individual field lines of the underlying vector field which enables us to provide a connection between surface helicity and rotational transform. Further, we show how some of our results may be utilised in the context of coil designs for plasma fusion confinement devices in order to obtain coil configurations of particular "simple" shape.
  Lastly, we consider the problem of optimising surface helicity among toroidal surfaces of fixed area and show that toroidal surfaces admitting a symmetry constitute global minimisers.</description>
