      <title>The Six-Vertex Yang-Baxter Grouped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parametrized Yang-Baxter equation is a map from a group to a set of R-matrices, satisfying the Yang-Baxter commutation relation. For the six-vertex model, there are two main regimes of the Yang-Baxter equation: the free-fermionic point, and everything else. For the free-fermionic point, there exists a parametrized Yang-Baxter equation with a large parameter group GL(2)xGL(1). For non-free-fermionic six-vertex matrices, there are also parametrized Yang-Baxter equations, but these do not account for all possible interactions. Instead we will construct a groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equation that does reflect all possible Yang-Baxter equations in the six-vertex model.</description>

      <title>On the category of Hopf braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf braces are the quantum analogues of skew braces and, as such, their cocommutative counterparts provide solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We investigate various properties of categories related to Hopf braces. In particular, we prove that the category of Hopf braces is accessible while the category of cocommutative Hopf braces is even locally presentable. We also show that functors forgetting multiple antipodes and/or multiplications down to coalgebras are monadic. Colimits in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces are described explicitly and a free cocommutative Hopf brace on an arbitrary cocommutative Hopf algebra is constructed.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on monomial realizations and polyhedral realizations for crystal bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal bases are powerful combinatorial tools in the representation theory of quantum groups $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ for a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras $\mathfrak{g}$. The polyhedral realizations are combinatorial descriptions of the crystal base $B(\infty)$ for Verma modules in terms of the set of integer points of a polyhedral cone, which equals the string cone when $\mathfrak{g}$ is finite dimensional simple. It is a fundamental and natural problem to find explicit forms of the polyhedral cone. The monomial realization expresses crystal bases $B(\lambda)$ of integrable highest weight representations as Laurent monomials with double indexed variables. In this paper, we give a conjecture between explicit forms of the polyhedral cones and monomial realizations. We prove the conjecture is true when $\mathfrak{g}$ is a classical Lie algebra, a rank $2$ Kac-Moody algebra or a classical affine Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>On the Representation Categories of Weak Hopf Algebras Arising from Levin-Wen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their study of Levin-Wen models [Commun. Math. Phys. 313 (2012) 351-373], Kitaev and Kong proposed a weak Hopf algebra associated with a unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ and a unitary left $\mathcal{C}$-module $\mathcal{M}$, and sketched a proof that its representation category is monoidally equivalent to the unitary $\mathcal{C}$-module functor category $\mathrm{Fun}^{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M})^\mathrm{rev}$. We give an independent proof of this result without the unitarity conditions. In particular, viewing $\mathcal{C}$ as a left $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{rev}}$-module, we obtain a quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra whose representation category is braided equivalent to the Drinfeld center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. In the appendix, we also compare this quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra with the tube algebra $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ when $\mathcal{C}$ is pivotal. These two algebras are Morita equivalent by the well-known equivalence $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}})\cong\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. However, we show that in general there is no weak Hopf algebra structure on $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ such that the above equivalence is monoidal.</description>

      <title>E(n)-coactions on semisimple Clifford algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that $E(n)$-coactions over a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ are classified by tuples $(\varphi, d_1, ... , d_n)$ consisting of an involution $\varphi$ and a family $(d_i)_{i=1,...,n}$ of $\varphi$-derivations satisfying appropriate conditions. Tuples of maps can be replaced by tuples of suitable elements $(c, u_1, . . . , u_n)$, whenever $A$ is a semisimple Clifford algebra.</description>

      <title>The Nilpotency Index for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-developed classification program for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ super conformal field theories (SCFTs) leverages Seiberg-Witten geometry on the Coulomb branch of vacua; theories are arranged by increasing $\mathfrak{rank}$, the complex dimension of their Coulomb branch. An alternative organizational scheme focusses on the associated vertex operator algebra (VOA), which is more closely related to the Higgs branch. From the VOA perspective, a natural way to arrange theories is by their ``index of nilpotency'', the smallest integer $\mathfrak{n}$ such that $T^\mathfrak{n} = 0$ in the $C_2$ algebra, where $T$ is the VOA stress tensor. It follows from the Higgs branch reconstruction conjecture that $\mathfrak{n} &lt; \infty$ for any 4d ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT. Extrapolating from several examples, we conjecture that $\mathfrak{n}$ is an RG monotone, $\mathfrak{n}_{\rm IR} \leq \mathfrak{n}_{\rm UV}$. What's more, we find in all cases that $\mathfrak{rank} \leq \mathfrak{n}-1$. Theory ordering by $\mathfrak{n}$ appears thus more refined than ordering by $\mathfrak{rank}$. For example, in the list of $\mathfrak{rank}=1$ theories, the Kodaira SCFTs and $SU(2)$ ${\cal N}=4$ SYM have $\mathfrak{n} =2$, while all others have $\mathfrak{n} &gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Morse theory of loop spaces and Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth closed $n$-manifold $M$ and a $\kappa$-tuple of basepoints $\boldsymbol{q}\subset M$, we define a Morse-type $A_\infty$-algebra $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$, called the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra, as a graded generalization of the braid skein algebra due to Morton and Samuelson. For example, when $M=T^2$ the braid skein algebra is the Type A double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA). The $A_\infty$-operations couple Morse gradient trees on a based loop space with Chas-Sullivan type string operations. We show that, after a certain "base change", $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$ is $A_\infty$-equivalent to the wrapped higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer $A_\infty$-algebra of $\kappa$ disjoint cotangent fibers which was studied in the work of Honda, Colin, and Tian. We also compute the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra for $M=S^2$, which we can regard as a derived Hecke algebra of the $2$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Diamond of triads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1712.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study minimal modular extensions of braided fusion categories, with emphasis on minimal modular extensions of super-Tannakian fusion categories. We define actions of finite super-groups on fermionic fusion categories and spin-braided fusion categories. Similar to the case of groups, our motivation stems from the study of fusion categories containing the representation category of a super-group. We develop many results analogous to the Tannakian case, including cohomological obstructions, relationships with braided $G$-crossed categories, and minimal modular extensions. We apply our general framework to the construction and classification of minimal modular extensions of super-groups and braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>The set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, Kimura semigroups and functional graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the category of solutions of the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation of Frobenius-Separability (FS) type is equivalent to the category of pointed Kimura semigroups. As applications, all involutive, idempotent, nondegenerate, surjective, finite order, unitary or indecomposable solutions of FS type are classified. For instance, if $|X| = n$, then the number of isomorphism classes of all such solutions on $X$ that are (a) left non-degenerate, (b) bijective, (c) unitary or (d) indecomposable and left-nondegenerate is: (a) the Davis number $d(n)$, (b) $\sum_{m|n} \, p(m)$, where $p(m)$ is the Euler partition number, (c) $\tau(n) + \sum_{d|n}\left\lfloor \frac d2\right\rfloor$, where $\tau(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$, or (d) the Harary number $\mathfrak{c} (n)$. The automorphism groups of such solutions can also be recovered as automorphism groups $\mathrm{Aut}(f)$ of sets $X$ equipped with a single endo-function $f:X\to X$. We describe all groups of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(f)$ as iterations of direct and (possibly infinite) wreath products of cyclic or full symmetric groups, characterize the abelian ones as products of cyclic groups, and produce examples of symmetry groups of FS solutions not of the form $\mathrm{Aut}(f)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the Z2-graded Hopf algebras. To present the constructions, we consider in detail the Borel half of Uq(sl(2)) and two super Hopf algebra examples: the Borel half of Uq(osp(1|2)) and the Borel half of Uq(gl(1|1)) for q being a root of unity. We prove the isomorphism between the Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras, which is missing in the literature, and extend the isomorphism to the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the Z2-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory [1, 2], as well as illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the full Uq(gl(1|1)) Hopf algebra. In addition, we generalise an isomorphism between the Drinfeld double and the loop algebra from the combinatorial quantisation to the graded setting.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all semisimple tensor categories. Furthermore, it extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under weak positivity constraints, encompassing all semisimple tensor categories as well. The primary tools employed in this paper are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories. Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation theory of algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.07255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to develop an explicit derived deformation theory of algebraic structures at a high level of generality, encompassing in a common framework various kinds of algebras (associative, commutative, Poisson...) or bialgebras (associative and coassociative, Lie, Frobenius...), that is algebraic structures parametrized by props. A central aspect is that we define and study moduli spaces of deformations of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms (and not just isotopies or isomorphisms). To do so, we implement methods coming from derived algebraic geometry, by encapsulating these deformation theories as classifying (pre)stacks with good infinitesimal properties and derived formal geometry, by means of derived formal moduli problems and derived formal groups. In particular, we prove that the Lie algebra describing the deformation theory of an object in a given $\infty$-category of dg algebras can be obtained equivalently as the tangent complex of loops on a derived quotient of this moduli space by the homotopy automorphims of this object. Moreover, we provide explicit formulae for such derived deformation problems of algebraic structures up to quasi-isomorphisms and relate them in a precise way to other standard deformation problems of algebraic structures. This relation is given by a fiber sequence of the associated dg-Lie algebras of their deformation complexes. Our results provide simultaneously a vast generalization of standard deformation theory of algebraic structures which is suitable (and needed) to set up algebraic deformation theory both at the $\infty$-categorical level and at a higher level of generality than algebras over operads. In addition, we study a general criterion to compare formal moduli problems of different algebraic structures and apply our formalism to $E_n$-algebras and bialgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a parabolic presentation of the extended Yangian $\X(\mathfrak{g}_{N})$ associated with the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}_{N}$ of type $B$ and $C$, parameterized by a symmetric composition $\nu$ of $N$. By formulating a block matrix version of the RTT presentation of $\X(\mathfrak{g}_{N})$, we systematically derive the generators and relations through the Gauss decomposition of the generator matrix in $\nu$-block form. Furthermore, leveraging this parabolic presentation, we obtain a novel formula for the center of $\X(\mathfrak{g}_{N})$, offering new insights into its structure.</description>
