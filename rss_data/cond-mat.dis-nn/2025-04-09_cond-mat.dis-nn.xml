      <title>Local equations describe unreasonably efficient stochastic algorithms in random K-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in characterizing the highly nonconvex landscapes of constraint satisfaction problems, the good performance of certain algorithms in solving hard combinatorial optimization tasks remains poorly understood. This gap in understanding stems largely from the lack of theoretical tools for analyzing their out-of-equilibrium dynamics. To address this challenge, we develop a system of approximate master equations that capture the behavior of local search algorithms in constraint satisfaction problems. Our framework shows excellent qualitative agreement with the phase diagrams of two paradigmatic algorithms: Focused Metropolis Search (FMS) and greedy-WalkSAT (G-WalkSAT) for random 3-SAT. The equations not only confirm the numerical observation that G-WalkSAT's algorithmic threshold is nearly parameter-independent, but also successfully predict FMS's threshold beyond the clustering transition. We also exploit these equations in a decimation scheme, demonstrating that the computed marginals encode valuable information about the local structure of the solution space explored by stochastic algorithms. Notably, our decimation approach achieves a threshold that surpasses the clustering transition, outperforming conventional methods like Belief Propagation-guided decimation. These results challenge the prevailing assumption that long-range correlations are always necessary to describe efficient local search dynamics and open a new path to designing efficient algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical renormalization of glassy dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quench dynamics of glassy systems are challenging. Due to aging, the system never reaches a stationary state but instead evolves on emergent scales that grow with its age. This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic descriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary state hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case scaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time. Here, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of Green's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of computational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed $p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses with strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial state. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously attainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition. Interestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal. While we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system, it is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.</description>

      <title>Exact Ground States of Two Dimensional $\pm J$ Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact analytical expressions for the ground-state energy and entropy of the two-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising spin glass, uncovering a nested hierarchy of frustrations. Each level in this hierarchy contributes through the kernel and pseudo-determinant of effective operators, capturing the energy and entropy, respectively. At leading order, the structure coincides with geometric plaquette frustrations, while subleading corrections arise from magnetic adjacency matrices defined on percolated clusters in the dual lattice. Our results, supported by numerical simulations, provide a systematic framework for analyzing spin-glass ground states and offer new insight into glass order in finite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Artificial Spin Ice: A Tutorial on Design and Control of Geometry, Microstate, Magnon Dynamics &amp; Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice, arrays of strongly interacting nanomagnets, are complex magnetic systems with many emergent properties, rich microstate spaces, intrinsic physical memory, high-frequency dynamics in the GHz range and compatibility with a broad range of measurement approaches. This tutorial article aims to provide the foundational knowledge needed to understand, design, develop, and improve the dynamic properties of artificial spin ice (ASI). Special emphasis is placed on introducing the theory of micromagnetics, which describes the complex dynamics within these systems, along with their design, fabrication methods, and standard measurement and control techniques. The article begins with a review of the historical background, introducing the underlying physical phenomena and interactions that govern artificial spin ice. We then explore standard experimental techniques used to prepare the microstate space of the nanomagnetic array and to characterize magnetization dynamics, both in artificial spin ice and more broadly in ferromagnetic materials. Finally, we introduce the basics of neuromorphic computing applied to the case of artificial spin ice systems with goal to help researchers new to the field grasp these exciting new developments.</description>

      <title>Bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction: Critical role of environmental interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The specific role of environmental interaction on bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction is explored within a tight-binding framework based on wave-guide theory. The environmental interaction is implemented through disorder in backbone sites where these sites are directly coupled to parent lattice sites of the ring via single bonds. In absence of backbone disorder circular current becomes zero for a lengthwise symmetric nanojunction, while it increases with disorder which is quite unusual, and after reaching a maximum it eventually drops to zero in the limit of high disorder. The effects of ring-electrode interface configuration, ring-backbone coupling, different types of backbone disorder and system temperature are critically investigated. All the studied results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters, giving us confidence that the outcomes of this theoretical work can be verified experimentally. To make this study self-contained, we also discuss the feasibility of detecting bias-driven circular current and provide design guidelines for implementing our proposed quantum system in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>Quantum resources of quantum and classical variational methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational techniques have long been at the heart of atomic, solid-state, and many-body physics. They have recently extended to quantum and classical machine learning, providing a basis for representing quantum states via neural networks. These methods generally aim to minimize the energy of a given ans\"atz, though open questions remain about the expressivity of quantum and classical variational ans\"atze. The connection between variational techniques and quantum computing, through variational quantum algorithms, offers opportunities to explore the quantum complexity of classical methods. We demonstrate how the concept of non-stabilizerness, or magic, can create a bridge between quantum information and variational techniques and we show that energy accuracy is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for accuracy in non-stabilizerness. Through systematic benchmarking of neural network quantum states, matrix product states, and variational quantum methods, we show that while classical techniques are more accurate in non-stabilizerness, not accounting for the symmetries of the system can have a severe impact on this accuracy. Our findings form a basis for a universal expressivity characterization of both quantum and classical variational methods.</description>

      <title>Training the parametric interactions in an analog bosonic quantum neural network with Fock basis measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks have the potential to be seamlessly integrated with quantum devices for the automatic recognition of quantum states. However, performing complex tasks requires a large number of neurons densely connected through trainable, parameterized weights - a challenging feat when using qubits. To address this, we propose leveraging bosonic modes and performing Fock basis measurements, enabling the extraction of an exponential number of features relative to the number of modes. Unlike qubits, bosons can be coupled through multiple parametric drives, with amplitudes, phases, and frequency detunings serving dual purposes: data encoding and trainable parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters, despite their differing physical dimensions, can be trained cohesively using backpropagation to solve benchmark tasks of increasing complexity. Notably, we show that the network can be trained even though the number of trainable parameters scales only linearly with the number of modes, whereas the number of neurons grows exponentially. Furthermore, we show that training not only reduces the number of measurements required for feature extraction compared to untrained quantum neural networks, such as quantum reservoir computing, but also significantly enhances the expressivity of the network, enabling it to solve tasks that are out of reach for quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Effective Method for Inverse Ising Problem under Missing Observations in Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are energy-based models analogous to the Ising model and are widely applied in statistical machine learning. The standard inverse Ising problem with a complete dataset requires computing both data and model expectations and is computationally challenging because model expectations have a combinatorial explosion. Furthermore, in many applications, the available datasets are partially incomplete, making it difficult to compute even data expectations. In this study, we propose a approximation framework for these expectations in the practical inverse Ising problems that integrates mean-field approximation or persistent contrastive divergence to generate refined initial points and spatial Monte Carlo integration to enhance estimator accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively and accurately tunes the model parameters in comparison to the conventional method.</description>
