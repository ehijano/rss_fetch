      <title>Provably Convergent Actor-Critic in Risk-averse MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning stationary policies in infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games (MGs) remains a fundamental open problem in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). While stationary strategies are preferred for their practicality, computing stationary forms of classic game-theoretic equilibria is computationally intractable -- a stark contrast to the comparative ease of solving single-agent RL or zero-sum games. To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic. Leveraging the regularity of RQE, we prove that this approach achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees. We empirically validate our algorithm in several environments to demonstrate superior convergence properties compared to risk-neutral baselines.</description>

      <title>Agent Skills for Large Language Models: Architecture, Acquisition, Security, and the Path Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic language models to modular, skill-equipped agents marks a defining shift in how large language models (LLMs) are deployed in practice. Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on demand -- enable dynamic capability extension without retraining. It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the SKILL.md specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries (SAGE), autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1\% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities. We identify seven open challenges -- from cross-platform skill portability to capability-based permission models -- and propose a research agenda for realizing trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems. Unlike prior surveys that broadly cover LLM agents or tool use, this work focuses specifically on the emerging skill abstraction layer and its implications for the next generation of agentic systems.

      <title>Theory of Mind Guided Strategy Adaptation for Zero-Shot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning is enabling agents to adapt to previously unseen teammates in a zero-shot fashion. Prior work in zero-shot coordination often follows a two-stage process, first generating a diverse training pool of partner agents, and then training a best-response agent to collaborate effectively with the entire training pool. While many previous works have achieved strong performance by devising better ways to diversify the partner agent pool, there has been less emphasis on how to leverage this pool to build an adaptive agent. One limitation is that the best-response agent may converge to a static, generalist policy that performs reasonably well across diverse teammates, rather than learning a more adaptive, specialist policy that can better adapt to teammates and achieve higher synergy. To address this, we propose an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind-based best-response selection to first infer its teammate's intentions and then select the most suitable policy from a policy ensemble. We conduct experiments in the Overcooked environment to evaluate zero-shot coordination performance under both fully and partially observable settings. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over a single best-response baseline.</description>

      <title>Building Large-Scale Drone Defenses from Small-Team Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defending against large adversarial drone swarms requires coordination methods that scale effectively beyond conventional multi-agent optimisation. In this paper, we propose to scale strategies proven effective in small defender teams by integrating them as modular components of larger forces using our proposed framework. A dynamic programming (DP) decomposition assembles these components into large teams in polynomial time, enabling efficient construction of scalable defenses without exhaustive evaluation. Because a unit that is strong in isolation may not remain strong when combined, we sample across multiple small-team candidates. Our framework iterates between evaluating large-team outcomes and refining the pool of modular components, allowing convergence on increasingly effective strategies. Experiments demonstrate that this partitioning approach scales to substantially larger scenarios while preserving effectiveness and revealing cooperative behaviours that direct optimisation cannot reliably discover.</description>

      <title>OptiML: An End-to-End Framework for Program Synthesis and CUDA Kernel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-performance CUDA kernels remains challenging due to the need to navigate a combinatorial space of low-level transformations under noisy and expensive hardware feedback. Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.</description>

      <title>GT-HarmBench: Benchmarking AI Safety Risks Through the Lens of Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier AI systems are increasingly capable and deployed in high-stakes multi-agent environments. However, existing AI safety benchmarks largely evaluate single agents, leaving multi-agent risks such as coordination failure and conflict poorly understood. We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures. We further show that game-theoretic interventions improve socially beneficial outcomes by up to 18%. Our results highlight substantial reliability gaps and provide a broad standardized testbed for studying alignment in multi-agent environments. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/causalNLP/gt-harmbench.</description>

      <title>Interference-Robust Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Computation for Decentralized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (NCOTA) computation enables low-latency and bandwidth-efficient decentralized optimization by exploiting the average energy superposition property of wireless channels. It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference.</description>

      <title>Bench-MFG: A Benchmark Suite for Learning in Stationary Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of Mean Field Games (MFGs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has fostered a growing family of algorithms designed to solve large-scale multi-agent systems. However, the field currently lacks a standardized evaluation protocol, forcing researchers to rely on bespoke, isolated, and often simplistic environments. This fragmentation makes it difficult to assess the robustness, generalization, and failure modes of emerging methods. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization. Based on our extensive empirical results, we propose guidelines to standardize future experimental comparisons.

      <title>Multi-Agent Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Joint State-Action Learned Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to coordinate many agents in partially observable and highly dynamic environments requires both informative representations and data-efficient training. To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimal Equilibrium Learning in Stochastic Games via Single-bit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decentralized equilibrium selection in stochastic games under severe information and communication constraints. In such settings, convergence to equilibrium alone is insufficient, as stochastic games typically admit many equilibria with markedly different welfare properties. We address decentralized optimal equilibrium selection, where agents coordinate on equilibria that optimize a designer-specified social welfare objective while allowing heterogeneous tolerance to deviations from strict best responses. Agents observe only the global state trajectory and their realized rewards, and exchange a single randomized bit of feedback per agent per round. This semantic content/discontent signaling mechanism implicitly aligns decentralized learning dynamics with the global welfare objective. We develop explore-and-commit and online variants applicable to general stochastic games, accommodating heterogeneous model-based or model-free methods for solving the induced Markov decision processes, and establish explicit finite-time regret guarantees, showing logarithmic expected regret under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>TRACE: Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution for Streaming Electronic Health Records (EHRs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode extensive medical knowledge but struggle to apply it reliably to longitudinal patient trajectories, where evolving clinical states, irregular timing, and heterogeneous events degrade performance over time. Existing adaptation strategies rely on fine-tuning or retrieval-based augmentation, which introduce computational overhead, privacy constraints, or instability under long contexts. We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions. Evaluated on longitudinal clinical event streams from MIMIC-IV, TRACE significantly improves next-event prediction accuracy, protocol adherence, and clinical safety over long-context and retrieval-augmented baselines, while producing interpretable and auditable reasoning traces.</description>

      <title>Learning Large-Scale Competitive Team Behaviors with Mean-Field Interactions and Online Opponent Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been proven effective across both collaborative and competitive tasks, existing algorithms often struggle to scale to large populations of agents. Recent advancements in mean-field (MF) theory provide scalable solutions by approximating population interactions as a continuum, yet most existing frameworks focus exclusively on either fully cooperative or purely competitive settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MF-MAPPO, a mean-field extension of PPO designed for zero-sum team games that integrate intra-team cooperation with inter-team competition. MF-MAPPO employs a shared actor and a minimally informed critic per team and is trained directly on finite-population simulators, thereby enabling deployment to realistic scenarios with thousands of agents. We further show that MF-MAPPO naturally extends to partially observable settings through a simple gradient-regularized training scheme. Our evaluation utilizes large-scale benchmark scenarios using our own testing simulation platform for MF team games (MFEnv), including offense-defense battlefield tasks as well as variants of population-based rock-paper-scissors games that admit analytical solutions, for benchmarking. Across these benchmarks, MF-MAPPO outperforms existing methods and exhibits complex, heterogeneous behaviors, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining mean-field theory and MARL techniques at scale.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Ego-graph Inference for Networked Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16606v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (Networked-MARL), decentralized agents must act under local observability and constrained communication over fixed physical graphs. Existing methods often assume static neighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments. While centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global state access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world decentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for Networked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph over its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we introduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse, context-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference. Each agent operates over an ego-graph and samples a latent communication mask to guide message passing and policy computation. The variational distribution is trained end-to-end alongside the policy using an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective, enabling agents to jointly learn both interaction topology and decision-making strategies. BayesG outperforms strong MARL baselines on large-scale traffic control tasks with up to 167 agents, demonstrating superior scalability, efficiency, and performance.</description>

      <title>A Simulation of Ageing and Care Accessibility in Italian Inner Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26496v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ageing societies face increasing strain on formal and informal care systems, particularly in low-density mountainous municipalities where sparse services and steep terrain constrain access. This study presents a spatially explicit agent-based model that integrates a road-network GIS, synthetic populations derived through Iterative Proportional Fitting, and behavioural heterogeneity to examine how alternative service configurations shape accessibility and caregiver burden. The model, applied to Premeno (Piedmont, Italy), compares a baseline distribution of ambulatory services with a relocation scenario at Villa Bernocchi. System-level indicators (Caregiver Effort, Overwhelmed Caregivers, Hours Not Cared, Walkability) and micro-spatial metrics (Walkability, Detour Ratio, Proximity) are analysed across 40 batches and 50 stochastic replications per scenario. Results reveal aggregate neutrality but pronounced local redistribution of accessibility. Sensitivity analysis shows that spatial impedance dominates accessibility, whereas behavioural capacity modulates care effort. The findings illustrate distinctive properties of complex adaptive social systems - emergence, heterogeneity, and feedback - demonstrating how computational social simulation can highlight policy trade-offs between spatial efficiency, social equity, and care sustainability in ageing territories.</description>

Abstract: Practical deployment of multi-agent systems (MAS) demands strong performance at test time, motivating methods that guide search during inference and selectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns values to partial inter-agent transcripts for each action and each agent, and acts as a controller during inference. MASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts labeled only with terminal outcome rewards, without requiring human step-level annotations, by propagating returns to local targets. During inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search (SBS) and MCTS, focusing computation on promising branches and pruning unpromising ones. We train and test MASPRM across different tasks and domains, using GSM8K, MATH, MMLU, and LogiQA as benchmarks. Averaged across these benchmarks, MASPRM improves Hit@1 over policy likelihood by up to $+13.4$ points and improves ranking quality, reducing Hit@1$-&gt;$Hit@5 gaps by up to $10.3$ points. MASPRM complements inference-time search by scoring intermediate routed transcripts to guide rollouts in MAS with fixed schedules. Code: https://github.com/milad1378yz/MASPRM</description>

      <title>A Survey on Hypergame Theory: Modeling Misaligned Perceptions and Nested Beliefs for Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19593</link>

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints, subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic multi-agent environments.</description>

      <title>WideSeek-R1: Exploring Width Scaling for Broad Information Seeking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.</description>
