      <title>Unimodality preservation by ratios of functional series and integral transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elementary, but very useful lemma due to Biernacki and Krzy\.{z} (1955) asserts that the ratio of two power series inherits monotonicity from that of the sequence of ratios of their corresponding coefficients. Over the last two decades it has been realized that, under some additional assumptions, similar claims hold for more general series ratios as well as for unimodality in place of monotonicity. This paper continues this line of research: we consider ratios of general functional series and integral transforms and furnish natural sufficient conditions for preservation of unimodality by such ratios. Numerous series and integral transforms appearing in applications satisfy our sufficient conditions, including Dirichlet, factorial and inverse factorial series, Laplace, Mellin and generalized Stieltjes transforms, among many others. Finally, we illustrate our general results by exhibiting certain statements on monotonicity patterns for ratios of some special functions. The key role in our considerations is played by the notion of sign regularity.</description>

      <title>Optimal power-weighted Hardy inequalities on finite intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a recently derived optimal Hardy inequality in integral form on finite intervals by Dimitrov, Gadjev, and Ismail \cite{DGI24} to the case of additional power weights and then derive an optimal power-weighted Hardy inequality in differential form on finite intervals, noting that the optimal constant of the latter inequality differs from the former. We also derive an optimal multi-dimensional version of the power-weighted Hardy inequality in differential form on spherical shell domains.</description>

      <title>Construction of a curved Kakeya set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a compact set in R2 of measure 0 containing a piece of a parabola of every aperture between 1 and 2. As a consequence, we improve lower bounds for the $L^p$-$L^q$ norm of the corresponding maximal operator for a range of $p$, $q$. Moreover, our construction can be generalised from parabolas to a family of curves with cinematic curvature.</description>

      <title>The Redner-ben-Avraham-Kahng cluster system without growth condition on the kinetic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of global mild solutions to the infinite dimensional Redner--ben-Avraham--Kahng cluster system is shown without growth or structure condition on the kinetic coefficients, thereby extending previous results in the literature. The key idea is to exploit the dissipative features of the system to derive a control on the tails of the infinite sums involved in the reaction terms. Classical solutions are also constructed for a suitable class of kinetic coefficients and initial conditions.</description>

      <title>An analogue of a formula of Popov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $r_{k}(n)$ denote the number of representations of the positive integer $n$ as the sum of $k$ squares. We prove a new summation formula involving $r_{k}(n)$ and the Bessel functions of the first kind, which constitutes an analogue of a result due to the Russian mathematician A. I. Popov.</description>

      <title>Restriction of Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions to submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov and Hu established $L^p$ estimates for the restriction of Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions to submanifolds. We investigate the eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operators with critically singular potentials, and estimate the $L^p$ norms and period integrals for their restriction to submanifolds. Recently, Blair-Sire-Sogge obtained global $L^p$ bounds for Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions by the resolvent method. Due to the Sobolev trace inequalities, the resolvent method cannot work for submanifolds of all dimensions. We get around this difficulty and establish spectral projection bounds by the wave kernel techniques and the bootstrap argument involving an induction on the dimensions of the submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Diagonally forced systems and the spectral signature of matrix cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given any square matrix, $\mathbf{M}$, whose diagonal elements are negative, and which is multiplied by a variable, $\sigma$, we wish to find the minimal $\sigma$ such that the eigenvalue of $\mathbf{M}_{\sigma}$ is exactly zero. By Gershgorin, we know that $\mathbf{M}_{\sigma}$ can be made stable by making $\sigma$ large enough. We prove a relation which analytically determines when and how we are able to find the value of $\sigma$ such that the maximal eigenvalue is exactly zero. In so doing, we prove the equivalence of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of $\mathbf{M}_{\sigma}$ and the eigenvalues that arise from a scaling operation on $\mathbf{M}$. Further, through the characteristic polynomial, we are able to isolate the dominant feedback cycles comprising the elements of the matrix which, under the action of $\sigma$, ensures the stability of the system. We then explore, using the stabilising and destabilising cycles within the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, an intrinsic spectral signature associated with any matrix based on the size and sign (or zero) of its respective elements.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Besov Spaces in Dunkl setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to characterize the homogeneous Besov space in the Dunkl setting. We utilize a new discrete reproducing formula, that is, the building blocks are differences of the Dunkl-Poisson kernel which involves both the Euclidean metric and the Dunkl metric. To introduce the Besov spaces in the Dunkl setting, new test functions and distributions are introduced, and a new decomposition is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of unbalanced interior nodes of divide-and-conquer trees on $n$ leaves is known to form a sequence of dilations of the Takagi function on dyadic rationals. We use this fact to derive identities on the Takagi function and on the Hamming weight of an integer in terms of the Takagi function.</description>

      <title>Periodic Waves for the Regularized Camassa-Holm Equation: Existence and Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. For the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct waves with the zero mean property and prove that waves with the same property may not exist for the well known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding the spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of a convenient linear operator, restricted to the space constituted by zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed by the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. We also discuss the problem of orbital stability in the energy space.</description>
