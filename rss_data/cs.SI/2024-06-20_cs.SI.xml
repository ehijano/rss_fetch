      <title>Exact Community Recovery (under Side Information): Optimality of Spectral Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of exact community recovery in general, two-community block models considering both Bernoulli and Gaussian matrix models, capturing the Stochastic Block Model, submatrix localization, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization as special cases. We also study the settings where $side$ $information$ about community assignment labels is available, modeled as passing the true labels through a noisy channel: either the binary erasure channel (where some community labels are known while others are erased) or the binary symmetric channel (where some labels are flipped). We provide a unified analysis of the effect of side information on the information-theoretic limits of exact recovery, generalizing prior works and extending to new settings. Additionally, we design a simple but optimal spectral algorithm that incorporates side information (when present) along with the eigenvectors of the matrix observation. Using the powerful tool of entrywise eigenvector analysis [Abbe, Fan, Wang, Zhong 2020], we show that our spectral algorithm can mimic the so called $genie$-$aided$ $estimators$, where the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ genie-aided estimator optimally computes the estimate of the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ label, when all remaining labels are revealed by a genie. This perspective provides a unified understanding of the optimality of spectral algorithms for various exact recovery problems in a recent line of work.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evaluation of Integrated Trust Mechanism to Improve Trust in E-commerce Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are mostly two approaches to tackle trust management worldwide Strong and crisp and Soft and Social. We analyze the impact of integrated trust mechanism in three different e-commerce services. The trust aspect is a dormant element between potential users and being developed expert or internet systems. We support our integration by preside over an experiment in controlled laboratory environment. The model selected for the experiment is a composite of policy and reputation based trust mechanisms and widely acknowledged in e-commerce industry. The integration between policy and trust mechanism was accomplished through mapping process, weakness of one brought to a close with the strength of other. Furthermore, experiment has been supervised to validate the effectiveness of implementation by segregating both integrated and traditional trust mechanisms in learning system</description>

      <title>GraphMU: Repairing Robustness of Graph Neural Networks via Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant application potential in various fields. However, GNNs are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Numerous adversarial defense methods on GNNs are proposed to address the problem of adversarial attacks. However, these methods can only serve as a defense before poisoning, but cannot repair poisoned GNN. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a method to repair poisoned GNN. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing the novel concept of model repair for GNNs. We propose a repair framework, Repairing Robustness of Graph Neural Networks via Machine Unlearning (GraphMU), which aims to fine-tune poisoned GNN to forget adversarial samples without the need for complete retraining. We also introduce a unlearning validation method to ensure that our approach effectively forget specified poisoned data. To evaluate the effectiveness of GraphMU, we explore three fine-tuned subgraph construction scenarios based on the available perturbation information: (i) Known Perturbation Ratios, (ii) Known Complete Knowledge of Perturbations, and (iii) Unknown any Knowledge of Perturbations. Our extensive experiments, conducted across four citation datasets and four adversarial attack scenarios, demonstrate that GraphMU can effectively restore the performance of poisoned GNN.</description>

      <title>A Unified Core Structure in Multiplex Networks: From Finding the Densest Subgraph to Modeling User Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many complex systems, the interactions between objects span multiple aspects. Multiplex networks are accurate paradigms to model such systems, where each edge is associated with a type. A key graph mining primitive is extracting dense subgraphs, and this has led to interesting notions such as K-cores, known as building blocks of complex networks. Despite recent attempts to extend the notion of core to multiplex networks, existing studies suffer from a subset of the following limitations: They 1) force all nodes to exhibit their high degree in the same set of relation types while in multiplex networks some connection types can be noisy for some nodes, 2) either require high computational cost or miss the complex information of multiplex networks, and 3) assume the same importance for all relation types. We introduce S-core, a novel and unifying family of dense structures in multiplex networks that uses a function S(.) to summarize the degree vector of each node. We then discuss how one can choose a proper S(.) from the data. To demonstrate the usefulness of S-cores, we focus on finding the densest subgraph as well as modeling user engagement in multiplex networks. We present a new density measure in multiplex networks and discuss its advantages over existing density measures. We show that the problem of finding the densest subgraph in multiplex networks is NP-hard and design an efficient approximation algorithm based on S-cores. Finally, we present a new mathematical model of user engagement in the presence of different relation types. Our experiments shows the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms and supports the proposed mathematical model of user engagement.</description>

      <title>Podcast Outcasts: Understanding Rumble's Podcast Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Podcasting on Rumble, an alternative video-sharing platform, attracts controversial figures known for spreading divisive and often misleading content, which sharply contrasts with YouTube's more regulated environment. Motivated by the growing impact of podcasts on political discourse, as seen with figures like Joe Rogan and Andrew Tate, this paper explores the political biases and content strategies used by these platforms. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of over 13K podcast videos from both YouTube and Rumble, focusing on their political content and the dynamics of their audiences. Using advanced speech-to-text transcription, topic modeling, and contrastive learning techniques, we explore three critical aspects: the presence of political bias in podcast channels, the nature of content that drives podcast views, and the usage of visual elements in these podcasts. Our findings reveal a distinct right-wing orientation in Rumble's podcasts, contrasting with YouTube's more diverse and apolitical content.</description>

      <title>Toward Structure Fairness in Dynamic Graph Embedding: A Trend-aware Dual Debiasing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies successfully learned static graph embeddings that are structurally fair by preventing the effectiveness disparity of high- and low-degree vertex groups in downstream graph mining tasks. However, achieving structure fairness in dynamic graph embedding remains an open problem. Neglecting degree changes in dynamic graphs will significantly impair embedding effectiveness without notably improving structure fairness. This is because the embedding performance of high-degree and low-to-high-degree vertices will significantly drop close to the generally poorer embedding performance of most slightly changed vertices in the long-tail part of the power-law distribution. We first identify biased structural evolutions in a dynamic graph based on the evolving trend of vertex degree and then propose FairDGE, the first structurally Fair Dynamic Graph Embedding algorithm. FairDGE learns biased structural evolutions by jointly embedding the connection changes among vertices and the long-short-term evolutionary trend of vertex degrees. Furthermore, a novel dual debiasing approach is devised to encode fair embeddings contrastively, customizing debiasing strategies for different biased structural evolutions. This innovative debiasing strategy breaks the effectiveness bottleneck of embeddings without notable fairness loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairDGE achieves simultaneous improvement in the effectiveness and fairness of embeddings.</description>

      <title>Integration of Policy and Reputation based Trust Mechanisms in e-Commerce Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The e-commerce systems are being tackled from commerce behavior and internet technologies. Therefore, trust aspect between buyer-seller transactions is a potential element which needs to be addressed in competitive e-commerce industry. The e-commerce industry is currently handling two different trust approaches. First approach consists on centralized mechanism where digital credentials/set of rules assembled, called Policy based trust mechanisms . Second approach consists on decentralized trust mechanisms where reputation, points assembled and shared, called Reputation based trust mechanisms. The difference between reputation and policy based trust mechanism will be analyzed and recommendations would be proposed to increase trust between buyer and seller in e-commerce industry. The integration of trust mechanism is proposed through mapping process, strength of one mechanism with the weakness of other. The proposed model for integrated mechanism will be presented and illustrated how the proposed model will be used in real world e-commerce industry.</description>

      <title>Effective Edge-wise Representation Learning in Edge-Attributed Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) is to encode graph elements into informative vector representations, which can be used in downstream tasks for analyzing graph-structured data and has seen extensive applications in various domains. However, the majority of extant studies on GRL are geared towards generating node representations, which cannot be readily employed to perform edge-based analytics tasks in edge-attributed bipartite graphs (EABGs) that pervade the real world, e.g., spam review detection in customer-product reviews and identifying fraudulent transactions in user-merchant networks. Compared to node-wise GRL, learning edge representations (ERL) on such graphs is challenging due to the need to incorporate the structure and attribute semantics from the perspective of edges while considering the separate influence of two heterogeneous node sets U and V in bipartite graphs. To our knowledge, despite its importance, limited research has been devoted to this frontier, and existing workarounds all suffer from sub-par results.
  Motivated by this, this paper designs EAGLE, an effective ERL method for EABGs. Building on an in-depth and rigorous theoretical analysis, we propose the factorized feature propagation (FFP) scheme for edge representations with adequate incorporation of long-range dependencies of edges/features without incurring tremendous computation overheads. We further ameliorate FFP as a dual-view FFP by taking into account the influences from nodes in U and V severally in ERL. Extensive experiments on 5 real datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed EAGLE models in semi-supervised edge classification tasks. In particular, EAGLE can attain a considerable gain of at most 38.11% in AP and 1.86% in AUC when compared to the best baselines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Networks: from Multipartite Entanglement to Hypergraph Immersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement, a higher-order interaction unique to quantum information, offers various advantages over bipartite entanglement in quantum network (QN) applications. Establishing multipartite entanglement across remote parties in QN requires entanglement routing, which irreversibly transforms the QN topology at the cost of existing entanglement links. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI Security: Exploring Robustness of Graph Neural Networks to Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success, but recent studies have shown that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which significantly hinders their use in safety-critical scenarios. Therefore, the design of robust GNNs has attracted increasing attention. However, existing research has mainly been conducted via experimental trial and error, and thus far, there remains a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability of GNNs. To address this limitation, we systematically investigate the adversarial robustness of GNNs by considering graph data patterns, model-specific factors, and the transferability of adversarial examples. Through extensive experiments, a set of principled guidelines is obtained for improving the adversarial robustness of GNNs, for example: (i) rather than highly regular graphs, the training graph data with diverse structural patterns is crucial for model robustness, which is consistent with the concept of adversarial training; (ii) the large model capacity of GNNs with sufficient training data has a positive effect on model robustness, and only a small percentage of neurons in GNNs are affected by adversarial attacks; (iii) adversarial transfer is not symmetric and the adversarial examples produced by the small-capacity model have stronger adversarial transferability. This work illuminates the vulnerabilities of GNNs and opens many promising avenues for designing robust GNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is becoming cheaper to launch disinformation operations at scale using AI-generated content, in particular 'deepfake' technology. We have observed instances of deepfakes in political campaigns, where generated content is employed to both bolster the credibility of certain narratives (reinforcing outcomes) and manipulate public perception to the detriment of targeted candidates or causes (adversarial outcomes). We discuss the threats from deepfakes in politics, highlight model specifications underlying different types of deepfake generation methods, and contribute an accessible evaluation of the efficacy of existing detection methods. We provide this as a summary for lawmakers and civil society actors to understand how the technology may be applied in light of existing policies regulating its use. We highlight the limitations of existing detection mechanisms and discuss the areas where policies and regulations are required to address the challenges of deepfakes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network immunization is an automated task in the field of network analysis that involves protecting a network (modeled as a graph) from being infected by an undesired arbitrary diffusion. In this article, we consider the spread of harmful content in social networks, and we propose CONTAIN, a novel COmmuNiTy-based Algorithm for network ImmuNization. Our solution uses the network information to (1) detect harmful content spreaders, and (2) generate partitions and rank them for immunization using the subgraphs induced by each spreader, i.e., employing CONTAIN. The experimental results obtained on real-world datasets show that CONTAIN outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, i.e., NetShield and SparseShield, by immunizing the network in fewer iterations, thus, converging significantly faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms. We also compared our solution in terms of scalability with the state-of-the-art tree-based mitigation algorithm MCWDST, as well as with NetShield and SparseShield. We can conclude that our solution outperforms MCWDST and NetShield.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recommender systems, users rate items, and are subsequently served other product recommendations based on these ratings. Even though users usually rate a tiny percentage of the available items, the system tries to estimate unobserved preferences by finding similarities across users and across items. In this work, we treat the observed ratings data as partially observed, dense, weighted, bipartite networks. For a class of systems without outside information, we adapt an approach developed for dense, weighted networks to account for unobserved edges and the bipartite nature of the problem. This approach allows for community structure, and for local estimation of flexible patterns of ratings across different pairs of communities. We compare the performance of our proposed approach to existing methods on a simulated data set, as well as on a data set of joke ratings, examining model performance in both cases at differing levels of sparsity.</description>

Abstract: Online gender based violence has grown concomitantly with adoption of the internet and social media. Its effects are worse in the Global majority where many users use social media in languages other than English. The scale and volume of conversations on the internet has necessitated the need for automated detection of hate speech, and more specifically gendered abuse. There is, however, a lack of language specific and contextual data to build such automated tools. In this paper we present a dataset on gendered abuse in three languages- Hindi, Tamil and Indian English. The dataset comprises of tweets annotated along three questions pertaining to the experience of gender abuse, by experts who identify as women or a member of the LGBTQIA community in South Asia. Through this dataset we demonstrate a participatory approach to creating datasets that drive AI systems.</description>

Abstract: Graph-structured data, prevalent in domains ranging from social networks to biochemical analysis, serve as the foundation for diverse real-world systems. While graph neural networks demonstrate proficiency in modeling this type of data, their success is often reliant on significant amounts of labeled data, posing a challenge in practical scenarios with limited annotation resources. To tackle this problem, tremendous efforts have been devoted to enhancing graph machine learning performance under low-resource settings by exploring various approaches to minimal supervision. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of Data-Efficient Graph Learning (DEGL) as a research frontier, and present the first survey that summarizes the current progress of DEGL. We initiate by highlighting the challenges inherent in training models with large labeled data, paving the way for our exploration into DEGL. Next, we systematically review recent advances on this topic from several key aspects, including self-supervised graph learning, semi-supervised graph learning, and few-shot graph learning. Also, we state promising directions for future research, contributing to the evolution of graph machine learning.</description>

      <title>LLM as Prompter: Low-resource Inductive Reasoning on Arbitrary Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11804</link>

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) inductive reasoning, which aims to infer missing facts from new KGs that are not seen during training, has been widely adopted in various applications. One critical challenge of KG inductive reasoning is handling low-resource scenarios with scarcity in both textual and structural aspects. In this paper, we attempt to address this challenge with Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we utilize the state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a graph-structural prompt to enhance the pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which brings us new methodological insights into the KG inductive reasoning methods, as well as high generalizability in practice. On the methodological side, we introduce a novel pretraining and prompting framework ProLINK, designed for low-resource inductive reasoning across arbitrary KGs without requiring additional training. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate our approach on 36 low-resource KG datasets and find that ProLINK outperforms previous methods in three-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot reasoning tasks, exhibiting average performance improvements by 20%, 45%, and 147%, respectively. Furthermore, ProLINK demonstrates strong robustness for various LLM promptings as well as full-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>Repeat-Aware Neighbor Sampling for Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic graph learning equips the edges with time attributes and allows multiple links between two nodes, which is a crucial technology for understanding evolving data scenarios like traffic prediction and recommendation systems. Existing works obtain the evolving patterns mainly depending on the most recent neighbor sequences. However, we argue that whether two nodes will have interaction with each other in the future is highly correlated with the same interaction that happened in the past. Only considering the recent neighbors overlooks the phenomenon of repeat behavior and fails to accurately capture the temporal evolution of interactions. To fill this gap, this paper presents RepeatMixer, which considers evolving patterns of first and high-order repeat behavior in the neighbor sampling strategy and temporal information learning. Firstly, we define the first-order repeat-aware nodes of the source node as the destination nodes that have interacted historically and extend this concept to high orders as nodes in the destination node's high-order neighbors. Then, we extract neighbors of the source node that interacted before the appearance of repeat-aware nodes with a slide window strategy as its neighbor sequence. Next, we leverage both the first and high-order neighbor sequences of source and destination nodes to learn temporal patterns of interactions via an MLP-based encoder. Furthermore, considering the varying temporal patterns on different orders, we introduce a time-aware aggregation mechanism that adaptively aggregates the temporal representations from different orders based on the significance of their interaction time sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RepeatMixer over state-of-the-art models in link prediction tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed repeat-aware neighbor sampling strategy.</description>
