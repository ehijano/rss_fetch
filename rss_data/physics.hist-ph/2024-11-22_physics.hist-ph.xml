      <title>The Laboratory of Mechanics and Acoustics in Marseilles (France): from the first world war to the present day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laboratory of Mechanics and Acoustics in Marseilles (France) was created in 1941, under the name of Centre de Recherches Scientifiques, Industrielles et Maritimes (CRSIM). But it was actually issued from the French Naval Research Center created in Toulon by the French Navy to work on submarine detection during World War I. LMA is therefore the result of a long and quite amazing story with several moves and even more name changes. It benefited from all these events and is today established in a new campus with large facilities specially designed for its latest research activities. This article presents the story in some details, summarize the evolution of the research domains through all these years and finally gives a description of the LMA today.</description>

      <title>Underestimation of Hubble constant error bars: a historical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of a historical compilation of Hubble-Lema\^itre constant values ($H_0$: 163 data points measured between 1976 and 2019) assuming the standard cosmological model gives a $\chi^2$ value of the dispersion with respect to the weighted average of 580, much larger than the number of points, which has an associated probability that is very low. This means that Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, due either to the underestimation of statistical error bars associated with the observed parameter measurements, or to the fact that systematic errors were not properly taken into account in many of the measurements.
  The fact that the underestimation of error bars for $H_0$ is so common might explain the apparent 4.4-sigma discrepancy by Riess et al. As a matter of fact, more recent precise $H_0$ measurements with JWST data by Freedman et al. using standard candles in galaxies find there is no tension with CMBR data, possibly indicating that previously Riess et al. had underestimated their errors.
  Here we have carried out a recalibration of the probabilities. The tension of 4.4-$\sigma $, estimated between the local Cepheid-supernova distance ladder and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, is indeed a 2.1-$\sigma $ tension in equivalent terms of a normal distribution, with an associated probability $P$ = 0.036 (1 in 28). This can be increased to an equivalent tension of 2.5-$\sigma $ in the worst cases of claimed 6-$\sigma $ tension, which may in any case happen as a random statistical fluctuation.
  If Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, and present day tensions are not more important than previous ones, why, then, is there so much noise and commotion surrounding Hubble tension after 2019? It is suggested here that this obeys a sociological phenomenon of ``groupthink''.</description>

      <title>Meaning at the Planck scale? Contextualized word embeddings for doing history, philosophy, and sociology of science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of contextualized word embeddings (CWEs) as a new tool in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS) for studying contextual and evolving meanings of scientific concepts. Using the term "Planck" as a test case, I evaluate five BERT-based models with varying degrees of domain-specific pretraining, including my custom model Astro-HEP-BERT, trained on the Astro-HEP Corpus, a dataset containing 21.84 million paragraphs from 600,000 articles in astrophysics and high-energy physics. For this analysis, I compiled two labeled datasets: (1) the Astro-HEP-Planck Corpus, consisting of 2,900 labeled occurrences of "Planck" sampled from 1,500 paragraphs in the Astro-HEP Corpus, and (2) a physics-related Wikipedia dataset comprising 1,186 labeled occurrences of "Planck" across 885 paragraphs. Results demonstrate that the domain-adapted models outperform the general-purpose ones in disambiguating the target term, predicting its known meanings, and generating high-quality sense clusters, as measured by a novel purity indicator I developed. Additionally, this approach reveals semantic shifts in the target term over three decades in the unlabeled Astro-HEP Corpus, highlighting the emergence of the Planck space mission as a dominant sense. The study underscores the importance of domain-specific pretraining for analyzing scientific language and demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of adapting pretrained models for HPSS research. By offering a scalable and transferable method for modeling the meanings of scientific concepts, CWEs open up new avenues for investigating the socio-historical dynamics of scientific discourses.</description>

      <title>Is there any Trinity of Gravity, to start with?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric trinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity equations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead of curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita connection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing but an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of having a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve any additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same time, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In particular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet another parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of modifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in GR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same physics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical inventions. For sure, one can always safely create novel constructions which do not influence the physical equations of motion, but in itself it does not make much sense and blatantly goes against the Occam's razor.</description>

      <title>Theories Without Models: Uncontrolled Idealizations in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbative treatment of realistic quantum field theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, requires the use of mathematical idealizations in the approximation series for scattering amplitudes. Such mathematical idealisations are necessary to derive empirically relevant models from the theory. Mathematical idealizations can be either controlled or uncontrolled, depending on whether current scientific knowledge can explain whether the effects of the idealization are negligible or not. Drawing upon negative formal results in asymptotic analysis (failure of Borel summability) and renormalization group theory (failure of asymptotic safety), we argue that the mathematical idealizations applied in perturbative quantum electrodynamics should be understood as uncontrolled. This, in turn, leads to the problematic conclusion that such theories do not have theoretical models in the standard understanding of this term. The existence of unquestionable empirically successful theories without theoretical models has significant implications both for our understanding of the theory-model relationship in physics and the concept of empirical adequacy.</description>
