      <title>Electron FLASH platform for pre-clinical research: LINAC modification, simplification of pulse control and dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: FLASH radiotherapy is a treatment regime that delivers therapeutic dose to tumors at an ultra-high dose rate while maintaining adequate normal tissue sparing. However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, potential late toxicities, and optimal fractionation schemes is important for successful clinical translation. This has necessitated extensive pre-clinical investigations, leading several research institutions to initiate dedicated FLASH research programs. Purpose: This work describes a workflow for establishing an easily accessible electron FLASH (eFLASH) platform. The platform incorporates simplified pulse control, optimized dose rate delivery, and validated Monte Carlo (MC) dose engine for accurate in vivo dosimetry dedicated to FLASH pre-clinical studies. Methods: Adjustment of the automatic frequency control (AFC) module allowed us to optimize the LINAC pulse form to achieve a uniform dose rate. A MC model for the 6 MeV FLASH beam was commissioned to ensure accurate dose calculation necessary for reproducible in vivo studies. Results: Optimizing the AFC module enabled the generation of a uniform pulse form, ensuring consistent dose per pulse and a uniform dose rate throughout FLASH irradiation. The MC model closely agreed with film measurements. MC dose calculations indicated that 6 MeV FLASH is adequate to achieve a uniform dose distribution for mouse whole brain irradiation but may not be optimal for the spinal cord study. Conclusions: We present a novel workflow for establishing a LINAC-based eFLASH research platform, incorporating techniques for optimized dose rate delivery, a simplified pulse control system, and validated MC engine. This work provides researchers with valuable new approaches to facilitate the development of robust and accessible LINAC-based system for FLASH studies.</description>

      <title>Electrical Impedance Tomography meets Reduced Order Modelling: a framework for faster and more reliable electrical conductivity estimations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Inclusion of individualised electrical conductivities of head tissues is crucial for the accuracy of electrical source imaging techniques based on electro/magnetoencephalography and the efficacy of transcranial electrical stimulation. Parametric electrical impedance tomography (pEIT) is a method to cheaply and non-invasively estimate them using electrode arrays on the scalp to apply currents and measure the resulting potential distribution. Conductivities are then estimated by iteratively fitting a forward model to the measurements, incurring a prohibitive computational cost that is generally lowered at the expense of accuracy. Reducing the computational cost associated with the forward solutions would improve the accessibility of this method and unlock new capabilities. Approach: We introduce reduced order modelling (ROM) to massively speed up the calculations of these solutions for arbitrary conductivity values. Main results: We demonstrate this new ROM-pEIT framework using a realistic head model with six tissue compartments, with minimal errors in both the approximated numerical solutions and conductivity estimations. We show that the computational complexity required to reach a multi-parameter estimation with a negligible relative error is reduced by more than an order of magnitude when using this framework. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefits of this new framework in a number of practical cases, including its application to real pEIT data from three subjects. Significance: Results suggest that this framework can transform the use of pEIT for seeking personalised head conductivities, making it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians.</description>

      <title>Full Field Transmission Tomography (FFOTT) for imaging extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) in cancer cell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the specificity of cancer cells to distinguish them from normal ones is an important step in the general framework of cancer diagnosis. A routine example of such diagnosis in cancerous tissues implies using microscope analysis of fixed, paraffined, and colored slices such as the H&amp;E stain (1). Such a method, which takes place after surgery, is based on carefully analyzing the cell's size and shape. Often, this approach is performed in parallel with more modern genetic tests. Recent research has hypothesized that extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) could be considered a new hallmark of cancer (4). Thus, this research aims to check if using a simple, label-free microscope dynamic analysis performed on living cancer cells would allow efficient and simpler detection of cancer cells.</description>

      <title>Digital cytometry: extraction of forward and side scattering signals from holotomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow cytometry is a cornerstone technique in medical and biological research, providing crucial information about cell size and granularity through forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) signals. Despite its widespread use, the precise relationship between these scatter signals and corresponding microscopic images remains underexplored. Here, we investigate this intrinsic relationship by utilizing scattering theory and holotomography, a three-dimensional quantitative phase imaging (QPI) technique. We demonstrate the extraction of FSC and SSC signals from individual, unlabeled cells by analyzing their three-dimensional refractive index distributions obtained through holotomography. Additionally, we introduce a method for digitally windowing SSC signals to facilitate effective segmentation and morphology-based cell type classification. Our approach bridges the gap between flow cytometry and microscopic imaging, offering a new perspective on analyzing cellular characteristics with high accuracy and without the need for labeling.</description>
