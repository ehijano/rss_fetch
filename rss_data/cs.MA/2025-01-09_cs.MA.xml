      <title>HIVEX: A High-Impact Environment Suite for Multi-Agent Research (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games have been vital test beds for the rapid development of Agent-based research. Remarkable progress has been achieved in the past, but it is unclear if the findings equip for real-world problems. While pressure grows, some of the most critical ecological challenges can find mitigation and prevention solutions through technology and its applications. Most real-world domains include multi-agent scenarios and require machine-machine and human-machine collaboration. Open-source environments have not advanced and are often toy scenarios, too abstract or not suitable for multi-agent research. By mimicking real-world problems and increasing the complexity of environments, we hope to advance state-of-the-art multi-agent research and inspire researchers to work on immediate real-world problems. Here, we present HIVEX, an environment suite to benchmark multi-agent research focusing on ecological challenges. HIVEX includes the following environments: Wind Farm Control, Wildfire Resource Management, Drone-Based Reforestation, Ocean Plastic Collection, and Aerial Wildfire Suppression. We provide environments, training examples, and baselines for the main and sub-tasks. All trained models resulting from the experiments of this work are hosted on Hugging Face. We also provide a leaderboard on Hugging Face and encourage the community to submit models trained on our environment suite.</description>

      <title>Unattainability of Common Knowledge in Asymmetric Games with Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a conceptual model game to examine the dynamics of asymmetric interactions in games with imperfect information. The game involves two agents with starkly contrasting capabilities: one agent can take actions but has no information of the state of the game, whereas the other agent has perfect information of the state but cannot act or observe the other agent's actions. This duality manifests an extreme form of asymmetry, and how differing abilities influence the possibility of attaining common knowledge. Using Kripke structures and epistemic logic we demonstrate that, under these conditions, common knowledge of the current game state becomes unattainable. Our findings advance the discussion on the strategic limitations of knowledge in environments where information and action are unevenly distributed.</description>

      <title>Implementing Systemic Thinking for Automatic Schema Matching: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several approaches are proposed to deal with the problem of the Automatic Schema Matching (ASM). The challenges and difficulties caused by the complexity and uncertainty characterizing both the process and the outcome of Schema Matching motivated us to investigate how bio-inspired emerging paradigm can help with understanding, managing, and ultimately overcoming those challenges. In this paper, we explain how we approached Automatic Schema Matching as a systemic and Complex Adaptive System (CAS) and how we modeled it using the approach of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS). This effort gives birth to a tool (prototype) for schema matching called Reflex-SMAS. A set of experiments demonstrates the viability of our approach on two main aspects: (i) effectiveness (increasing the quality of the found matchings) and (ii) efficiency (reducing the effort required for this efficiency). Our approach represents a significant paradigm-shift, in the field of Automatic Schema Matching.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Decentralized Perception in Multirobot Systems for Predicting Worker Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial environments, predicting human actions is essential for ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and robots. This paper introduces a perception framework that enables mobile robots to understand and share information about human actions in a decentralized way. The framework first allows each robot to build a spatial graph representing its surroundings, which it then shares with other robots. This shared spatial data is combined with temporal information to track human behavior over time. A swarm-inspired decision-making process is used to ensure all robots agree on a unified interpretation of the human's actions. Results show that adding more robots and incorporating longer time sequences improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, the consensus mechanism increases system resilience, making the multi-robot setup more reliable in dynamic industrial settings.</description>

      <title>A Digital Shadow for Modeling, Studying and Preventing Urban Crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crime is one of the greatest threats to urban security. Around 80 percent of the world's population lives in countries with high levels of criminality. Most of the crimes committed in the cities take place in their urban environments. This paper presents the development and validation of a digital shadow platform for modeling and simulating urban crime. This digital shadow has been constructed using data-driven agent-based modeling and simulation techniques, which are suitable for capturing dynamic interactions among individuals and with their environment. Our approach transforms and integrates well-known criminological theories and the expert knowledge of law enforcement agencies (LEA), policy makers, and other stakeholders under a theoretical model, which is in turn combined with real crime, spatial (cartographic) and socio-economic data into an urban model characterizing the daily behavior of citizens. The digital shadow has also been instantiated for the city of Malaga, for which we had over 300,000 complaints available. This instance has been calibrated with those complaints and other geographic and socio-economic information of the city. To the best of our knowledge, our digital shadow is the first for large urban areas that has been calibrated with a large dataset of real crime reports and with an accurate representation of the urban environment. The performance indicators of the model after being calibrated, in terms of the metrics widely used in predictive policing, suggest that our simulated crime generation matches the general pattern of crime in the city according to historical data. Our digital shadow platform could be an interesting tool for modeling and predicting criminal behavior in an urban environment on a daily basis and, thus, a useful tool for policy makers, criminologists, sociologists, LEAs, etc. to study and prevent urban crime.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Training for Pommerman: Curriculum Learning and Population-based Self-Play Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pommerman is a multi-agent environment that has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years. This environment is an ideal benchmark for multi-agent training, providing a battleground for two teams with communication capabilities among allied agents. Pommerman presents significant challenges for model-free reinforcement learning due to delayed action effects, sparse rewards, and false positives, where opponent players can lose due to their own mistakes. This study introduces a system designed to train multi-agent systems to play Pommerman using a combination of curriculum learning and population-based self-play. We also tackle two challenging problems when deploying the multi-agent training system for competitive games: sparse reward and suitable matchmaking mechanism. Specifically, we propose an adaptive annealing factor based on agents' performance to adjust the dense exploration reward during training dynamically. Additionally, we implement a matchmaking mechanism utilizing the Elo rating system to pair agents effectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that our trained agent can outperform top learning agents without requiring communication among allied agents.</description>

      <title>BudgetMLAgent: A Cost-Effective LLM Multi-Agent system for Automating Machine Learning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications including generation of code snippets, but often struggle with generating code for complex Machine Learning (ML) tasks. Although existing LLM single-agent based systems give varying performance depending on the task complexity, they purely rely on larger and expensive models such as GPT-4. Our investigation reveals that no-cost and low-cost models such as Gemini-Pro, Mixtral and CodeLlama perform far worse than GPT-4 in a single-agent setting. With the motivation of developing a cost-efficient LLM based solution for solving ML tasks, we propose an LLM Multi-Agent based system which leverages combination of experts using profiling, efficient retrieval of past observations, LLM cascades, and ask-the-expert calls. Through empirical analysis on ML engineering tasks in the MLAgentBench benchmark, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, using no-cost models, namely Gemini as the base LLM, paired with GPT-4 in cascade and expert to serve occasional ask-the-expert calls for planning. With 94.2\% reduction in the cost (from \$0.931 per run cost averaged over all tasks for GPT-4 single agent system to \$0.054), our system is able to yield better average success rate of 32.95\% as compared to GPT-4 single-agent system yielding 22.72\% success rate averaged over all the tasks of MLAgentBench.</description>

      <title>Incentivized Symbiosis: A Paradigm for Human-Agent Coevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation is vital to our survival and progress. Evolutionary game theory offers a lens to understand the structures and incentives that enable cooperation to be a successful strategy. As artificial intelligence agents become integral to human systems, the dynamics of cooperation take on unprecedented significance. The convergence of human-agent teaming, contract theory, and decentralized frameworks like Web3, grounded in transparency, accountability, and trust, offers a foundation for fostering cooperation by establishing enforceable rules and incentives for humans and AI agents. We conceptualize Incentivized Symbiosis as a social contract between humans and AI, inspired by Web3 principles and encoded in blockchain technology, to define and enforce rules, incentives, and consequences for both parties. By exploring this paradigm, we aim to catalyze new research at the intersection of systems thinking in AI, Web3, and society, fostering innovative pathways for cooperative human-agent coevolution.</description>

      <title>Can We Enhance the Quality of Mobile Crowdsensing Data Without Ground Truth?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has emerged as a prominent trend across various domains. However, ensuring the quality of the sensing data submitted by mobile users (MUs) remains a complex and challenging problem. To address this challenge, an advanced method is needed to detect low-quality sensing data and identify malicious MUs that may disrupt the normal operations of an MCS system. Therefore, this article proposes a prediction- and reputation-based truth discovery (PRBTD) framework, which can separate low-quality data from high-quality data in sensing tasks. First, we apply a correlation-focused spatio-temporal Transformer network that learns from the historical sensing data and predicts the ground truth of the data submitted by MUs. However, due to the noise in historical data for training and the bursty values within sensing data, the prediction results can be inaccurate. To address this issue, we use the implications among the sensing data, which are learned from the prediction results but are stable and less affected by inaccurate predictions, to evaluate the quality of the data. Finally, we design a reputation-based truth discovery (TD) module for identifying low-quality data with their implications. Given the sensing data submitted by MUs, PRBTD can eliminate the data with heavy noise and identify malicious MUs with high accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the PRBTD method outperforms existing methods in terms of identification accuracy and data quality enhancement.</description>

      <title>The Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs: does evolution favour AI over humans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs. To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. The framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates following a Universal Darwinism approach, interact via messages, influence each other's beliefs through dynamics based on a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with an abstract implementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness by up to 8%. We further discuss implications for control (e.g. legislation) and Digico as a means of studying evolutionary principles.</description>

      <title>Fully Data-driven but Interpretable Human Behavioural Modelling with Differentiable Discrete Choice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete choice models are essential for modelling various decision-making processes in human behaviour. However, the specification of these models has depended heavily on domain knowledge from experts, and the fully automated but interpretable modelling of complex human behaviours has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we introduce the differentiable discrete choice model (Diff-DCM), a fully data-driven method for the interpretable modelling, learning, prediction, and control of complex human behaviours, which is realised by differentiable programming. Solely from input features and choice outcomes without any prior knowledge, Diff-DCM can estimate interpretable closed-form utility functions that reproduce observed behaviours. Comprehensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that Diff-DCM can be applied to various types of data and requires only a small amount of computational resources for the estimations, which can be completed within tens of seconds on a laptop without any accelerators. In these experiments, we also demonstrate that, using its differentiability, Diff-DCM can provide useful insights into human behaviours, such as an optimal intervention path for effective behavioural changes. This study provides a strong basis for the fully automated and reliable modelling, prediction, and control of human behaviours.</description>
