      <title>Background reduction in $^{136}$Xe double beta decay experiments through direct barium ion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tagging barium ions in double beta decay experiments involving $^{136}$Xe offers a promising pathway to achieving an almost background-free environment, which is essential for addressing key unresolved questions in neutrino physics, such as the nature of neutrinos and their mass hierarchy. In this manuscript, we present a novel detection scheme that relies exclusively on the intrinsic energy levels of the barium ion. This method eliminates the need for additional additives in the xenon vessel, thereby simplifying the experimental setup and enhancing the potential sensitivity of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision Spectroscopy of Antiprotonic Atoms for Probing Strong-field QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PAX (antiProtonic Atom X-ray spectroscopy) is a new experiment with the aim to test strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects by performing high-precision x-ray spectroscopy of antiprotonic atoms. By utilizing advanced microcalorimeter detection techniques and a low-energy antiproton beam provided by the ELENA ring at CERN, gaseous targets will be used for the creation of antiprotonic atoms, and the measurement of transitions between circular Rydberg states will be conducted with up to two orders of magnitude improved accuracy over previous studies using high-purity germanium detectors. Our approach eliminates the longstanding issue of nuclear uncertainties that have hindered prior studies using highly charged ions, thus enabling direct and purely QED-focused measurements. By precisely probing atomic systems with electric fields up to two orders of magnitude above the Schwinger limit, PAX will test vacuum polarization and second-order QED corrections, opening new frontiers in fundamental physics and uncovering potential pathways to physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Precision magnetometry at cryogenic temperatures with gaseous 3He NMR probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on compact, gaseous 3He NMR probes for precision magnetometry of magnetic fields B &gt; 0.1 T in the temperature range from ambient temperatures down to 4 Kelvin. The gas is polarized at thermal equilibrium under pressures up to 100 bar to provide a high nuclear spin density. In order to achieve sensor readout rates of order (Hz), paramagnetic substances and/or silica gel with high specific surface area were added to reduce the otherwise long T1 relaxation time of pure 3He gas to reach thermal polarization equilibrium. Sensitivity limits, which cover the range from 10-11 &lt; dB/B &lt; 10-7, are sccessible in a single-pulse NMR measurement and can be further improved through signal averaging in accumulated NMR scans.</description>

      <title>Precision Spectroscopy of Antiprotonic Atoms for Investigation of Low-energy Antinucleon-nucleus Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a high-precision x-ray spectroscopy experiment of antiprotonic atoms to advance the understanding of low-energy antinucleon-nucleus interactions. The current leading model of antiproton-nucleus interactions is based on an optical potential with parameters derived from a global fit to antiprotonic atom x-ray data across the periodic table. However, the isovector parameter of this potential remains poorly constrained due to uncertainties in nucleon distributions of the nuclei. To address this, we propose to use calcium isotopes with well-studied nucleon distributions to minimize these uncertainties. A superconducting microcalorimeter detector will provide a resolution of 50-70 eV in the energy range of interest, allowing high precision determination of the isotope-dependent strong-interaction shifts and widths. The outcomes of the proposed experiment can be used to refine the model of antinucleon-nucleus interactions and provide critical data for future experiments searching for neutron-antineutron oscillations.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Manipulation of Rydberg States for Very Low Frequency Fields Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very low frequency(VLF) band is widely used in submarine communication and geophysical exploration for its strong penetration and long-distance propagation. This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates Rydberg EIT in 133Cs vapor under VLF and DC fields. A model is established to describe the EIT spectral response under dual-field conditions, with theoretical predictions showing agreement with experimental results. We propose a novel calibration-free method to measure VLF electric fields, bypassing traditional Stark shift measurements. This method detects additional splitting intervals of Stark sublevels, separated from the degenerate energy level under a DC field. This phenomenon arises from the averaging effect of sublevel sinusoidal oscillations in the spectrum induced by the VLF field. The splitting interval is proportionally dependent on the VLF field amplitude. The VLF electric field sensor is enhanced by increasing the strength of the DC field, extending the traceable measurement limit for weak VLF electric fields by more than an order of magnitude. This work highlights the potential for precise VLF electric field measurements, significantly advancing the calibration-free detection capabilities of Rydberg atom sensors for low-frequency applications.</description>

      <title>Entering the overcritical regime of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production in collisions of bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays and superintense, tightly focused laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-future high-intensity lasers offer prospects for the observation of nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production in an overcritical field regime, where the quantum nonlinearity parameter substantially exceeds unity. This experimentally yet unexplored scenario is envisaged here to be reached via the collision of a tightly focused laser pulse with high-energy bremsstrahlung photons. We calculate the achievable number of positrons in a range of laser intensities around 10$^{23}$ W/cm$^2$ and GeV-energies of the incident bremsstrahlung-generating electron beam. We investigate under which conditions the attenuation of the $\gamma$-beam due to the production process must be taken into account. In the considered interaction regime, where the local production rate grows rather moderately with higher field intensities, it is shown that the range of mostly contributing bremsstrahlung frequencies is generally very broad. For sufficiently large values of the quantum nonlinearity parameter, an optimum domain of frequencies emerges which is located far below the spectral endpoint. Furthermore, we show that it is beneficial for achieving the optimum pair yield to increase the interaction volume by a wider laser focus at the expense of decreased field intensity.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization to non-Gibbs states in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that equilibrium energy distributions in many-body chaotic systems can be qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions. This effect can appear in systems with finite energy spectra, which support both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum degeneracy, when the eigenstates fill a substantial part of the Hilbert space. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced detection of spin polarization in a microfabricated atomic vapor cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate continuous Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) nondestructive monitoring of the electron spin polarization of an atomic vapor in a microfabricated vapor cell within an optical resonator. The two-chamber silicon and glass cell contains $^{87}$Rb and 1.3 amagat of N$_{2}$ buffer gas, and is placed within a planar optical resonator formed by two mirrors with dichroic dielectric coatings to resonantly enhance the coupling to phase-modulated probe light near the D$_2$ line at 780 nm. We describe the theory of signal generation in this system, including the spin-dependent complex refractive index, cavity optical transfer functions, and PDH signal response to spin polarization. We observe cavity transmission and PDH signals across $\approx 200$ GHz of detuning around the atomic resonance line. By resonant optical pumping on the 795 nm D$_1$ line, we observe spin-dependent cavity line shifts, in good agreement with theory. We use the saturation of the line shift vs. optical pumping power to calibrate the number density and efficiency of the optical pumping. In the unresolved sideband regime, we observe quantum-noise-limited PDH readout of the spin polarization density, with a flat noise floor of $9 \times 10^9$ spins cm$^{-3}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for frequencies above 700 Hz. We note possible extensions of the technique.</description>

Abstract: Atomic clocks are at the leading edge of accuracy and precision and are essential for synchronization of distributed critical infrastructure, position, navigation and timing, and scientific applications. There has been a breakthrough in the performance of atomic clocks with the shift from microwave to optical frequency transitions. However, this performance increase has come at the cost of size, complexity and fragility, which has confined optical clocks to laboratories. Here we report on a recent international collaboration where three emerging optical clocks, each based on different operating principles, were trialled at sea. Over weeks of unsupervised naval operation, these clocks demonstrated exceptional reliability and provided frequency stability outputs in optical, microwave and radio-frequency domains. The performance of all three devices was orders of magnitude superior to existing best-in-class commercial solutions over short and medium timescales, marking a significant step toward deploying optical clocks in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop measurements in an atom interferometer gyroscope with velocity-dependent phase-dispersion compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atom interferometer-based gyroscopes are expected to have a wide range of applications due to their high sensitivity. However, their dynamic range is limited by dephasing caused by velocity-dependent Sagnac phase shift in combination with the longitudinal velocity distribution of the atoms, restricting measurements of large angular velocities. In this study, we present a method for restoring the contrast deterioration in angular velocity measurements with interferometer gyroscopes using atomic beams. Our findings show that by introducing the pseudo-rotation effect with appropriate two-photon detunings for Raman lights in the interferometer, it is possible to effectively cancel the Sagnac phase shift for all atoms in the velocity distribution of the beam. Consequently, the contrast is unaffected by the rotation. Furthermore, we applied this method to an interferometer gyroscope with counter-propagating atomic beams sharing the same Raman lights. It is found that the angular velocity of the system can be estimated through the detuning point where the phase difference between the two interferometers is zero. This approach ensures that the scale factor of the atom interferometer gyroscope is independent of the change in the longitudinal velocity distribution of the atomic beam. We demonstrate our technique using the interferometer gyroscope of thermal atomic beams of rubidium-87, achieving a measurement of angular velocity of $\mathrm{{1.0}^{\circ}/s}$ even with an acceleration of 0.68$\mathrm{m/s^2}$ on a three-axis rotation table. This simple and robust dispersion compensation method with Raman light detuning benefits dynamic angular velocity measurements in field applications such as the inertial navigation of vehicles.</description>
