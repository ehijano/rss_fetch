      <title>Machine-learning approaches to accelerating lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has seen an explosive growth of interest in exploiting developments in machine learning to accelerate lattice QCD calculations. On the sampling side, generative models are a promising approach to mitigating critical slowing down and topological freezing. Meanwhile, signal-to-noise problems have been shown to be improvable by the use of optimized improved observables. Both techniques can be made free of bias, resulting in trustworthy but reduced statistical errors. This talk reviews recent developments in this field.</description>

      <title>Path optimization method for the sign problem caused by fermion determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path optimization method with machine learning is applied to the one-dimensional massive lattice Thirring model, which has the sign problem caused by the fermion determinant. This study aims to investigate how the path optimization method works for the sign problem. We show that the path optimization method successfully reduces statistical errors and reproduces the analytic results. We also examine an approximation of the Jacobian calculation in the learning process and show that it gives consistent results with those without an approximation.</description>

      <title>Baryon-Electric Charge Correlations and Chemical Potentials as Probes of Magnetized QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD results of quadratic fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD in the presence of a background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical pion mass $m_\pi$ = 135 MeV on $N_\tau=8$ and 12 lattices. We find that the correlation between net baryon number and electric charge, denoted as $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11} $, can serve as a magnetometer of QCD. At pseudocritical temperatures ($T_{pc}$) the $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ starts to increase rapidly with magnetic field strength $eB \gtrsim 2M^2_{\pi}$ and by a factor 2 at $eB\simeq 8 M^2_{\pi}$. By comparing with the hadron resonance gas model, we find that the $eB$ dependence of $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ is mainly due to the doubly charged $\Delta$(1232) baryon. Although the doubly charged $\Delta$(1232) could not be detected experimentally, its decay products, protons and pions, retain the $eB$ dependence of $\Delta$(1232)'s contribution to $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$. Furthermore, the ratio of electric charge chemical potential to baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$, shows significant dependence on the magnetic field strength and varies with the ratio of electric charge to baryon number in the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions. These results provide baselines for effective theory and model studies, and both $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ could be useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments as compared with corresponding results from the hadron resonance gas model.</description>

      <title>Lattice Weyl Fermion on a Single Spherical Domain-Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a single spherical domain-wall embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean lattice. We employ the Shamir-type domain-wall fermion formulation, where the negative mass region is confined inside the $S^2$ domain-wall, while the positive mass outside is taken to the infinite limit, allowing the exterior region to be neglected effectively. In the absence of a gauge potential, Weyl fermions emerge as edge-localized modes along the $S^2$ domain-wall. When a nontrivial $U(1)$ gauge potential is present, additional zero modes with opposite chirality appears, localized at the center near the monopole. This centrally localized mode originates from the effective mass contribution of the Wilson term, which induces a domain-wall near the monopole.</description>

      <title>The NRQCD $\Upsilon$ spectrum at non-zero temperature using Backus-Gilbert regularisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the properties of heavy mesons change as temperature increases is crucial for gaining valuable insights into the quark-gluon plasma. Information about meson masses and decay widths is encoded in the meson spectral function, which, in principle, can be extracted from Euclidean correlation functions via generalised Laplace transformations. However, this inverse problem is ill-posed for lattice correlation functions and requires regularisation. In this work, we present the latest results for bottomonium spectral functions obtained within the lattice NRQCD framework using the Backus-Gilbert regularisation, along with two other variants, one of which is commonly referred to as the HLT method. Our analysis employs Generation 2L anisotropic lattice configurations produced by the \textsc{Fastsum} collaboration.</description>

      <title>Chiral rank-$k$ truncations for the multigrid preconditioner of Wilson fermions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modification to the setup algorithm for the multigrid preconditioner of Wilson fermions in lattice QCD. A larger number of test vectors than that used in conventional multigrid is generated by the smoother. This set of test vectors is then truncated by a singular value decomposition on the chiral components of the test vectors, which are subsequently used to form the prolongation and restriction matrices of the multigrid hierarchy. This modification is demonstrated to improve the convergence of linear equations on an anisotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 239$ MeV from the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration and an isotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 220$ MeV from the MILC Collaboration. The lattice volume dependence of the method is also examined.</description>

      <title>Error Scaling of Sea Quark Isospin-Breaking Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea-quark isospin-breaking effects (IBE) are difficult to compute since they require the evaluation of all-to-all propagators. However, the quest for high-precision calculations motivates a detailed study of these contributions. There are strong arguments that the stochastic error associated with these quantities should diverge in the continuum and infinite-volume limit, resulting in a possible bottleneck for the method. In this talk, we present the study of the error scaling for these quantities using $N_f=3$ $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions QCD with C-periodic boundary conditions in space, a pion mass $M_{\pi}=400$ MeV, a range of lattice spacings $a=0.05, 0.075, 0.1$ fm, and volumes $L=1.6, 2.4, 3.2$ fm. The analysis of the error as a function of the number of stochastic sources shows that we reach the gauge error for the dominant contributions. The errors do not show the leading order divergence $1/a$ for strong-IBE and $1/a^2$ for electromagnetic IBE, in the considered range of lattice spacings. On the other hand, our data are consistent with the predicted leading divergence $\sqrt{V}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have carried out lattice simulations of $(2+1)$-flavor QCD using highly improved staggered quarks at the physical pion mass on $32^3 \times 8$ and $48^3 \times 12$ lattices, with magnetic field strengths ranging up to 0.8 GeV$^2$ and nonzero baryon chemical potentials employing the Taylor expansion framework. We present lattice QCD continuum estimate results, along with the magnetized hadron resonance and ideal gas comparisons, for the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients for bulk thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, number density, energy density, and entropy density, focusing on the significant impact of strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic excited bottomonia from a basis of smeared operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottomonia play a crucial role in our understanding of the quark gluon plasma. We present lattice non-relativistic QCD calculations of bottomonia at temperatures in the range $T \in [47, 380]$ MeV using the Fastsum Generation 2L anisotropic $N_f = 2 + 1$ ensembles. The use of a basis of smeared operators allows the extraction of excited-state masses at zero temperature and an investigation of their thermal properties at non-zero temperature. We find that the ground state signal is substantially improved by this variational approach at finite temperature. We also apply the time-derivative moments approach to the projected or optimal correlation functions at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Smeared $R$-ratio in isospin symmetric QCD with Low Mode Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Mode Average (LMA) is a technique to improve the quality of the signal-to-noise ratio in the long time separation of Euclidean correlation functions. We report on its beneficial impact in computing the vector-vector light connected two-point correlation functions and derived physical quantities in the mixed action lattice setup adopted by ETM collaboration. We focus on preliminary results of the computation within isospin symmetric QCD (isoQCD) of the $R$-ratio smeared with Gaussian kernels of widths down to $\sigma\sim250$ MeV, which is enough to appreciate the $\rho$ resonance around 770 MeV, using the Hansen-Lupo-Tantatlo (HLT) spectral-density reconstruction method.</description>

      <title>Search for a Lee-Yang edge singularity in high-statistics Wuppertal-Budapest data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near a critical endpoint the Lee-Yang edge singularity approaches the real axis in the complex chemical potential plane. In the vicinity of the critical point the functional form of this approach depends on the universality class. Assuming a three dimensional Ising critical point in the QCD phase diagram the location of the critical endpoint can be extrapolated provided that the position of the Lee-Yang edge singularity is known at multiple temperatures. A popular method to estimate the position of a singularity is to model the free energy as a rational function of the baryon chemical potential $\mu_\text{B}$. The parameters of this model can be constrained by the cumulants of the net baryon density taken at $\mu_\text{B}^2\leq0$ . Using high-statistics simulations on a lattice $16^3\times8$ by the Wuppertal-Budapest Collaboration we estimate the location of the closest singularity in the QCD phase diagram. We also compare various models for the functional form of the free energy and discuss the predictive power of this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of GPU from different vendors demands the Lattice QCD codes to support multiple architectures. To this end, Open Computing Language (OpenCL) is one of the viable frameworks for writing a portable code. It is of interest to find out how the OpenCL implementation performs as compared to the code based on a dedicated programming interface such as CUDA for Nvidia GPUs. We have developed an OpenCL backend for our already existing code of the Wuppertal-Budapest collaboration. In this contribution, we show benchmarks of the most time consuming part of the numerical simulation, namely, the inversion of the Dirac operator. We present the code performance on the JUWELS and LUMI Supercomputers based on Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, respectively, and compare with the CUDA backend implementation.</description>

      <title>HMC and gradient flow with machine-learned classically perfect fixed-point actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-point (FP) lattice actions are classically perfect, i.e., they have continuum classical properties unaffected by discretization effects and are expected to have suppressed lattice artifacts at weak coupling. Therefore they provide a possible way to extract continuum physics with coarser lattices, allowing to circumvent problems with critical slowing down and topological freezing towards the continuum limit. We use machine-learning methods to parameterize a FP action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using lattice gauge-covariant convolutional neural networks. The large operator space allows us to find superior parameterizations compared to previous studies and we show how such actions can be efficiently simulated with the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that FP lattice actions can be used to define a classically perfect gradient flow without any lattice artifacts at tree level. We present initial results for scaling of the gradient flow with the FP action.</description>

      <title>U(1)-gauged 2-flavor spin system in 3-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a U(1)-gauged 2-component spin system in 3 dimensions. For the gauge fields we use the Villain formulation with a constraint that removes lattice monopoles and in this form couple the gauge fields to 2-component spins. We discuss the simulation strategies for this highly constraint system and present first results for the phase structure. Our preliminary Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the system undergoes a second order phase transition driven by the spin coupling. However, the correlation length critical exponent is inconsistent with the conformal bootstrap constraint for a critical (rather than multi-critical) fixed point, which forces a conclusion that the transition is likely weakly 1st order, passing close to a multi-critical point. To reliably resolve the nature of the transition, simulations on larger lattices will be necessary.</description>

      <title>On analytic continuation from imaginary to real chemical potential in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary baryon number chemical potential simulations are a popular workaround for the (in)famous sign problem plaguing finite density QCD studies on the lattice. One is necessarily left with the problem of analytically continuing results to real values of $\mu_B$. In the framework of the Bielefeld Parma Collaboration, we have in recent years studied a multi-point Pad\'e description of the net baryon number density computed as a function of imaginary baryon number chemical potential. While our main emphasis has till now been on the determination of Lee-Yang singularities, the method is per se a natural tool to analytically continue results. We report on the status of our projects with this respect, comparing the Pad\'e approach to analytic continuation to another, new strategy, which is an application of the Cauchy integral formula in the sense of an inverse problem.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has long been an experimental technology with the potential to simulate, at scale, phenomena which on classical devices would be too expensive to simulate at any but the smallest scales. Over the last several years, however, it has entered the NISQ era, where the number of qubits are sufficient for quantum advantage but substantial noise on hardware stands in the way of this achievement. This thesis details NISQ device-centered improvements to techniques of quantum simulation of the out-of-equilbrium real-time dynamics of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) and of dense 3-flavor neutrino systems on digital quantum devices.
  The first project concerning LQCD is a comparison of methods for implementing the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) that initializes the ground state of an SU(3) plaquette-chain. The thesis then pivots to a 1+1D lattice of quarks interacting with an SU(3) gauge-field. A VQE-based state-preparation for the vacua and a Trotterized time-evolution circuit is designed and applied to the problems of simulating beta and neutrinoless double beta decay. Finally, these circuits are adapted to a version useable on quantum devices with nearest-neighbor connectivity with minimal overhead, with an eye towards utilizing the higher qubit count of such devices for hadron dynamics and scattering.
  This thesis covers two projects that concern dense 3-flavor neutrino systems. The first details design and testing of Trotterized time-evolution circuits on state-of-the-art quantum devices. The second, motivated by the Gottesman-Knill theorem's result that deviation from stabilizer states ("magic") is necessary for a problem to exhibit quantum advantage, details results with implications for the Standard Model in general that the 3 flavor ultradense neutrino systems with the highest, most-persistent magic are those that start with neutrinos in all 3 flavors.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary nature of the nucleon scalar charge and its densities as a signal of nontrivial vacuum structure of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely known that the nucleon scalar charge is proportional to the pion-nucleon sigma term as one of the important low energy observables of QCD. Especially interesting to us is the physics of the nucleon scalar charge densities. This comes from the fact that the corresponding operator has the same quantum number as the physical vacuum. It indicates unusual behavior of the the nucleon scalar density as a function of the distance $r$ from the nucleon center. Namely, it would not be reduced down to zero at the spatial infinity but rather approaches some nonzero constant corresponding to the vacuum quark condensate. Naturally, this unique nature of the nucleon scalar density in the position space also affects the corresponding density in the momentum space, i.e. the corresponding parton distribution function (PDF) as a function of the Bjorken variable $x$. This PDF is known as the chiral-odd twist-3 PDF $e (x)$. We argue that $e(x)$ is likely to have a delta-function type singularity at $x=0$, and that the appearance of this singularity can be interpreted as a signal of the nontrivial vacuum structure of the QCD.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of two-flavored spin-zero heavy dibaryons in lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: We present the ground state energy spectra of two-flavored heavy dibaryons in the spin-singlet channel. In particular, the ground state masses of $\Omega_{llQ}\Omega_{llQ}, \Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{llQ}$ and $\Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{QlQ}$ states are computed and compared with their respective lowest non-interacting energy levels, where the flavor $Q \in (c,b)$ denotes charm and bottom quarks, and the other flavor $l \in {s,c,b}$ represents strange, charm and bottom, respectively. Considering their valence quark structures, these hadrons could be thought of as the heavy flavor analogues of spin-singlet nucleon-nucleon states. The gauge configurations employed in this study are HISQ ensembles with $N_f = 2+1+1$ flavors, generated by the MILC collaboration, at four lattice spacings, namely $a=0.1207, 0.0888, 0.0582$ and $0.0448$ fm. The aforementioned states are also computed at different quark masses, between $m_s \le m_l \le m_b$, including at unphysical heavy quark masses, to explore the quark mass dependence of any possible binding. For the dibaryon states $\Omega_{bbc}\Omega_{bbc}, \Omega_{ccb}\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{ccb} \Omega_{bbc}$, we find a clear evidence of an energy level below their respective non-interacting energy levels. In addition, for these dibaryons at quark masses $m_c &lt; m_l \le m_b$, a trend is found where the gap, between the lowest energy levels and the respective lowest non-interacting levels, increases as the quark mass $m_l$ increases. We also study the heavy quark spin-symmetry and its breaking for these heavy dibaryons.</description>

      <title>Predicting the spectrum and decay constants of positive-parity heavy-strange mesons using domain-wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the masses and decay constants of the positive-parity heavy-strange mesons $D^*_{s0}$, $D_{s1}$, $B^*_{s0}$, and $B_{s1}$. The calculations are performed with domain-wall fermions for the light and strange quarks and an anisotropic clover action for the charm and bottom quarks. We use seven different RBC/UKQCD ensembles with pion masses ranging from a near-physical 139 MeV up to 431 MeV. We consider two different analysis types, with or without two-meson operators at the source. We observe the expected below-threshold ground states. The fits without the two-meson operators appear to be more stable, but may overestimate the ground-state energies, while preliminary fits with two-meson operators at the source only appear to underestimate the ground-state energies.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>
