      <title>Objective Mackey and Tambara functors via parametrized categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first word in the title is intended in a sense suggested by Lawvere and Schanuel whereby finite sets are objective natural numbers. At the objective level, the axioms defining abstract Mackey and Tambara functors are categorically familiar. The first step was taken by Harald Lindner in 1976 when he recognized that Mackey functors, defined as pairs of functors, were single functors with domain a category of spans. We define objective Mackey and objective Tambara functors as parametrized categories which have local finite products and satisfy some parametrized completeness and cocompleteness restriction. However, we can replace the original parametrizing base for objective Mackey functors by a bicategory of spans while the replacement for objective Tambara functors is a bicategory obtained by iterating the span construction; these iterated spans are polynomials. There is an objective Mackey functor of ordinary Mackey functors. We show that there is a distributive law relating objective Mackey functors to objective Tambara functors analogous to the distributive law relating abelian groups to commutative rings. We remark on hom enrichment matters involving the 2-category $\mathrm{Cat}_{+}$ of categories admitting finite coproducts and functors preserving them, both as a closed base and as a skew-closed base.</description>

      <title>Random Variables, Conditional Independence and Categories of Abstract Sample Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two high-level "pictures" of probability theory have emerged: one that takes as central the notion of random variable, and one that focuses on distributions and probability channels (Markov kernels). While the channel-based picture has been successfully axiomatized, and widely generalized, using the notion of Markov category, the categorical semantics of the random variable picture remain less clear. Simpson's probability sheaves are a recent approach, in which probabilistic concepts like random variables are allowed vary over a site of sample spaces. Simpson has identified rich structure on these sites, most notably an abstract notion of conditional independence, and given examples ranging from probability over databases to nominal sets. We aim bring this development together with the generality and abstraction of Markov categories: We show that for any suitable Markov category, a category of sample spaces can be defined which satisfies Simpson's axioms, and that a theory of probability sheaves can be developed purely synthetically in this setting. We recover Simpson's examples in a uniform fashion from well-known Markov categories, and consider further generalizations.</description>

      <title>A Sheaf-Theoretic Characterization of Tasks in Distributed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task solvability lies at the heart of distributed computing, with direct implications for both theoretical understanding and practical system design. The field has evolved multiple theoretical frameworks for this purpose, including topological approaches, epistemic logic, and adversarial models, but these often address specific problem classes, limiting cross-domain applications. Our approach provides a unifying mathematical perspective across message-passing system models. We introduce a unifying sheaf-theoretic perspective that represents task solvability across message-passing system models while maintaining clear connections to the underlying distributed computing principles.
  A fundamental challenge in distributed computing is constructing global solutions from local computations and information. Sheaf theory addresses this challenge by providing a mathematical framework for assessing globally consistent properties from locally defined data, offering a natural language to describe and reason about distributed tasks. Sheaves have proven valuable in studying similar local-to-global phenomena, from opinion dynamics to contextuality in quantum mechanics and sensor integration. We now extend this framework to distributed systems.
  In this paper, we introduce a sheaf-theoretic characterization of task solvability in any model with a message based adversary. We provide a novel construction of a task sheaf, and prove that non-trivial sections correspond to valid solutions of a task, while obstructions to global sections represent system limitations that make tasks unsolvable. Furthermore, we also show that the cohomology of a task sheaf may be used to compute solving protocols. This opens space for new connections between distributed computing and sheaf theory for both protocol design and impossibility analysis.</description>

      <title>Norms in equivariant homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $\infty$-category of normed algebras in genuine $G$-spectra, as introduced by Bachmann-Hoyois, is modelled by strictly commutative algebras in $G$-symmetric spectra for any finite group $G$. We moreover provide an analogous description of Schwede's ultra-commutative global ring spectra in higher categorical terms.
  Using these new descriptions, we exhibit the $\infty$-category of ultra-commutative global ring spectra as a partially lax limit of the $\infty$-categories of genuine $G$-spectra for varying $G$, in analogy with the non-multiplicative comparison of Nardin, Pol, and the second author.
  Along the way, we establish various new results in parametrized higher algebra, which we hope to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The category of $\pi$-finite spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the category of truncated spaces with finite homotopy invariants ($\pi$\=/finite spaces) has many of the features expected of an elementary \oo topos. It should be thought of as the natural higher analogue of the elementary 1-topos of finite sets, with which it shares several initiality properties. The paper has also an appendix about univalent families in \oo pretopoi.</description>

      <title>Model structure from one hereditary complete cortorsion pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast with the Hovey correspondence of abelian model structures from two complete cotorsion pairs, Beligiannis and Reiten give a construction of model structures on abelian categories from only one complete cotorsion pair. The aim of this paper is to extend this result to weakly idempotent complete exact categories, by adding the condition of heredity of the complete cotorsion pair. In fact, even for abelian categories, this condition of heredity should be added. This construction really gives model structures which are not necessarily exact in the sense of Gillespie. The correspondence of Beligiannis and Reiten of weakly projective model structures also holds for weakly idempotent complete exact categories.</description>

      <title>Non-Cartesian Guarded Recursion with Daggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guarded recursion is a framework allowing for a formalisation of streams in classical programming languages. The latter take their semantics in cartesian closed categories. However, some programming paradigms do not take their semantics in a cartesian setting; this is the case for concurrency, reversible and quantum programming for example. In this paper, we focus on reversible programming through its categorical model in dagger categories, which are categories that contain an involutive operator on morphisms. After presenting classical guarded recursion, we show how to introduce this framework into dagger categories with sufficient structure for data types, also called dagger rig categories. First, given an arbitrary category, we build another category shown to be suitable for guarded recursion in multiple ways, via enrichment and fixed point theorems. We then study the interaction between this construction and the structure of dagger rig categories, aiming for reversible programming. Finally, we show that our construction is suitable as a model of higher-order reversible programming languages, such as symmetric pattern-matching.</description>

      <title>Order Theory in the Context of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper ``Tropical Geometry of Deep Neural Networks'' by L. Zhang et al. introduces an equivalence between integer-valued neural networks (IVNN) with $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ and tropical rational functions, which come with a map to polytopes. Here, IVNN refers to a network with integer weights but real biases, and $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ is defined as $\text{ReLU}_{t}(x)=\max(x,t)$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$.
  For every poset with $n$ points, there exists a corresponding order polytope, i.e., a convex polytope in the unit cube $[0,1]^n$ whose coordinates obey the inequalities of the poset. We study neural networks whose associated polytope is an order polytope. We then explain how posets with four points induce neural networks that can be interpreted as $2\times 2$ convolutional filters. These poset filters can be added to any neural network, not only IVNN.
  Similarly to maxout, poset pooling filters update the weights of the neural network during backpropagation with more precision than average pooling, max pooling, or mixed pooling, without the need to train extra parameters. We report experiments that support our statements.
  We also define the structure of algebra over the operad of posets on poset neural networks and tropical polynomials. This formalism allows us to study the composition of poset neural network arquitectures and the effect on their corresponding Newton polytopes, via the introduction of the generalization of two operations on polytopes: the Minkowski sum and the convex envelope.</description>

      <title>Fra\"iss\'e limit and Ramsey Theorem: the case of MV-algebras and a categorical generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the Fra\"iss\'e limit of finite MV-algebras and then prove that finite MV-algebras verify the Ramsey property. Then we show that MV-algebras are just a special case of a more general situation. In fact, under minumum conditions for the application of the Kechris-Pestov-Todorcevic correspondence, Ramsey property holds for a certain category of finite structures if and only if it holds for a completion subcategory of it.</description>
