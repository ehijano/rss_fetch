      <title>Applying generative neural networks for fast simulations of the ALICE (CERN) experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of state-of-the-art advances in generative neural networks for fast simulation of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) neutron detector in the ALICE experiment at CERN. Traditional simulation methods using the GEANT Monte Carlo toolkit, while accurate, are computationally demanding. With increasing computational needs at CERN, efficient simulation techniques are essential. The thesis provides a comprehensive literature review on the application of neural networks in computer vision, fast simulations using machine learning, and generative neural networks in high-energy physics. The theory of the analyzed models is also discussed, along with technical aspects and the challenges associated with a practical implementation. The experiments evaluate various neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and MLP-Mixers, as well as generative frameworks such as autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, vector quantization models, and diffusion models. Key contributions include the implementation and evaluation of these models, a significant improvement in the Wasserstein metric compared to existing methods with a low generation time of 5 milliseconds per sample, and the formulation of a list of recommendations for developing models for fast ZDC simulation. Open-source code and detailed hyperparameter settings are provided for reproducibility. Additionally, the thesis outlines future research directions to further enhance simulation fidelity and efficiency.</description>

      <title>TCAD Simulations of Radiation Damage in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To increase the scientific output of particle physics experiments, upgrades are underway at all major accelerator facilities to significantly improve the luminosity. Consequently, the solid-state detectors used in the experiments will exhibit more severe radiation-induced damage. To ensure sufficiently long sensor lifetimes, alternative materials to the established silicon sensors, with improved resilience to radiation, are investigated. For one of the promising candidate materials, silicon carbide, only recently a model describing the radiation damage in technology aided computer design (TCAD) simulations has been proposed.
  In this paper we present our latest achievements towards modeling radiation damage of 4H-SiC in TCAD tools. We first verify the utilized TCAD framework against published silicon data and then use it to approximate measurements of neutron-irradiated 4H-SiC particle detectors. We are able to confirm in simulations the measurement results, i.e., an almost flat capacitance as a function of bias voltage and a decreasing forward current with increasing particle fluence. Based on our simulations we are able to explain the latter by trapped charge carriers that create a space charge region within the device.</description>

      <title>Effect of hydrogen on albedo neutrons in lunar surface: A computational investigation by means of GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the interaction of the cosmic ray protons with the lunar surface in the absence and presence of hydrogen, a series of GEANT4 simulations are employed in the current study to unveil the influence of hydrogen on the energy spectrum of the albedo neutrons that escape from the lunar surface. Initially, a discrete 69-bin proton energy spectrum between 0.4 and 115 GeV based on the PAMELA spectrometer is implemented into GEANT4. Subsequently, a single-volume lunar surface of 2-m thickness is constructed where it is assumed that a single layer of either 1.6 or 1.93 g/cm$^{3}$ constitutes the lunar regolith. The material composition in the present study includes 43.7 wt.$\%$ oxygen, 0.3 wt.$\%$ sodium, 5.6 wt.$\%$ magnesium, 9 wt.$\%$ aluminum, 21.1 wt.$\%$ silicon, 8.5 wt.$\%$ calcium, 1.5 wt.$\%$ titanium, 0.1 wt.$\%$ manganese, and 10.2 wt.$\%$ iron in accordance with another study. Then, 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen is introduced by replacing oxygen in order to assess the impact of hydrogen on the secondary neutrons. In the wake of irradiating a lunar surface of 3$\times$2$\times$3 m$^{3}$ with a planar vertical PAMELA proton beam of 20$\times$20 cm$^{2}$, the depth profile of the generated neutrons as well as the corresponding initial energy spectrum is primarily obtained in the absence and presence of 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen by voxelizing the entire geometry with 100 cells of 2-cm thickness. Next, a surface detector is placed at the top of the lunar surface in order to collect the albedo neutrons in both cases, and the energy spectra of the albedo neutrons are acquired in terms of thermal, epithermal, and fast neutrons. From the GEANT4 simulations in this study, it is shown that the presence of 0.1 wt.$\%$ hydrogen is observable in each energy regime of the albedo neutrons at the lunar surface, thereby providing an indication about the elemental variation of the lunar soil.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating sub-electron noise performance in Single electron Sensitive Readout (SiSeRO) devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) is a novel on-chip charge detection technology that can, in principle, provide significantly greater responsivity and improved noise performance than traditional charge coupled device (CCD) readout circuitry. The SiSeRO, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, uses a p-MOSFET transistor with a depleted back-gate region under the transistor channel; as charge is transferred into the back gate region, the transistor current is modulated. With our first generation SiSeRO devices, we previously achieved a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 4.5 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV, at a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s and for a detector temperature of 250 K. Importantly, since the charge signal remains unaffected by the SiSeRO readout process, we have also been able to implement Repetitive Non-Destructive Readout (RNDR), achieving an improved ENC performance. In this paper, we demonstrate sub-electron noise sensitivity with these devices, utilizing an enhanced test setup optimized for RNDR measurements, with excellent temperature control, improved readout circuitry, and advanced digital filtering techniques. We are currently fabricating new SiSeRO detectors with more sensitive and RNDR-optimized amplifier designs, which will help mature the SiSeRO technology in the future and eventually lead to the pathway to develop active pixel sensor (APS) arrays using sensitive SiSeRO amplifiers on each pixel. Active pixel devices with sub-electron sensitivity and fast readout present an exciting option for next generation, large area astronomical X-ray telescopes requiring fast, low-noise megapixel imagers.</description>

Abstract: Future strategic X-ray satellite telescopes, such as the probe-class Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), will require excellent soft energy response in their imaging detectors to enable maximum discovery potential. In order to characterize Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) and Single Electron Sensitive Read Output (SiSeRO) detectors in the soft X-ray region, the X-ray Astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford has developed, assembled, and commissioned a 2.5-meter-long X-ray beamline test system. The beamline is designed to efficiently produce monoenergetic X-ray fluorescence lines in the 0.3-10 keV energy range and achieve detector temperatures as low as 173 K. We present design and simulation details of the beamline, and discuss the vacuum, cooling, and X-ray fluorescence performance achieved. As a workhorse for future detector characterization at Stanford, the XOC beamline will support detector development for a broad range of X-ray astronomy instruments.</description>

      <title>X-ray speed reading with the MCRC: prototype success and next generation upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is a NASA probe class mission concept designed to deliver arcsecond resolution with an effective area ten times that of Chandra (at launch). The AXIS focal plane features an MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) detector working in conjunction with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC). While this readout ASIC targets the AXIS mission, it is applicable to a range of potential X-ray missions with comparable readout requirements. Designed by the X-ray astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford University, the MCRC ASIC prototype (MCRC-V1.0) uses a 350 nm technology node and provides 8 channels of high speed, low noise, low power consumption readout electronics. Each channel implements a current source to bias the detector output driver, a preamplifier to provide gain, and an output buffer to interface directly to an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. The MCRC-V1 ASIC exhibits comparable performance to our best discrete electronics implementations, but with ten times less power consumption and a fraction of the footprint area. In a total ionizing dose (TID) test, the chip demonstrated a radiation hardness equal or greater to 25 krad, confirming the suitability of the process technology and layout techniques used in its design. The next iteration of the ASIC (MCRC-V2) will expand the channel count and extend the interfaces to external circuits, advancing its readiness as a readout-on-a-chip solution for next generation X-ray CCD-like detectors. This paper summarizes our most recent characterization efforts, including the TID radiation campaign and results from the first operation of the MCRC ASIC in combination with a representative MIT-LL CCD.</description>

      <title>Simulation study of performance of the Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is a mission concept proposed to detect gamma-ray photons through both the Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production mechanisms, enabling the detection of photons with energies ranging from MeV to TeV. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey of the gamma-ray sky from a low Earth orbit using an anti-coincidence detector, a tracker detector that also serves as a low energy calorimeter, and a high energy imaging calorimeter. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation application of the detector with the GEANT4 toolkit to evaluate the instrument performance including the effective area, angular resolution and energy resolution, as well as explored specific optimizations of the detector configuration. Our simulation-based analysis indicates that the VLAST's current design is physically feasible, with an acceptance larger than 10~$\rm m^2\ sr$ which is four times larger than Fermi-LAT, an energy resolution better than 2\% at 10~GeV, and an angular resolution better than 0.2 degrees at 10~GeV. The VLAST project is expected to make significant contribution to the field of gamma-ray astronomy and to enhance our understanding of the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray susceptibility of the Terahertz Intensity Mapper detector arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the effects of cosmic ray interactions with the Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) based focal plane array for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). TIM is a NASA-funded balloon-borne experiment designed to probe the peak of the star formation in the Universe. It employs two spectroscopic bands, each equipped with a focal plane of four $\sim\,$900-pixel, KID-based array chips. Measurements of an 864-pixel TIM array shows 791 resonators in a 0.5$\,$GHz bandwidth. We discuss challenges with resonator calibration caused by this high multiplexing density. We robustly identify the physical positions of 788 (99.6$\,$%) detectors using a custom LED-based identification scheme. Using this information we show that cosmic ray events occur at a rate of 2.1$\,\mathrm{events/min/cm^2}$ in our array. 66$\,$% of the events affect a single pixel, and another 33$\,$% affect $&lt;\,$5 KIDs per event spread over a 0.66$\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ region (2 pixel pitches in radius). We observe a total cosmic ray dead fraction of 0.0011$\,$%, and predict that the maximum possible in-flight dead fraction is $\sim\,$0.165$\,$%, which demonstrates our design will be robust against these high-energy events.</description>

Abstract: Optical beam deflection is a popular method to measure the deformation of micromechanical devices. As it measures mostly a local slope, its sensitivity depends on the location and size of the optical spot. We present a method to evaluate precisely these parameters, using the relative amplitude of the thermal noise induced vibrations. With a case study of a microcantilever, we demonstrate the accuracy of the approach, as well as its ability to fully characterize the sensitivity of the detector and the parameters (mass, stiffness) of the resonator.</description>

      <title>On the development of an RFSoC-based ultra-fast Phasemeter with GHz bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise measurements of the frequency and phase of an electrical or optical signal play a key role in various branches of science and engineering. Tracking changing laser frequencies is especially demanding when the lasers themselves are noisy or if the frequencies rapidly change because they encode highly dynamic signals in, e.g., Doppler-ranging or dynamic cavity readout. Here, to address these and other possible applications, we report the development of a high signal bandwidth (&gt; 2 GHz) and high tracking bandwidth (2 MHz) multi-channel Phasemeter. The implementation utilizes an all-digital phase-locked loop realized within the field programmable gate array (FPGA) part of a Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC), the programmable logic (PL). The new features of the phasemeter are obtained by operating the PL at its timing limits and introducing a multi-demodulation and phase accumulation scheme. We present performance measurements, discuss the role of the high tracking bandwidth for tracking highly dynamic signals, and demonstrate ultra-stable phase locking of a beat note between two widely tunable external cavity diode lasers. We achieve a phase-noise floor in the sub-milli radian regime when comparing two signals, even for GHz frequencies, and demonstrate stable tracking of signals with a frequency change rate of 240 GHz/s.</description>

      <title>A novel mechanical design of a bolometric array for the CROSS double-beta decay experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CROSS experiment will search for neutrinoless double-beta decay using a specific mechanical structure to hold thermal detectors. The design of the structure was tuned to minimize the background contribution, keeping an optimal detector performance. A single module of the structure holds two scintillating bolometers (with a crystal size of 45x45x45 mm and a Ge slab facing the crystal's upper side) in the Cu frame, allowing for a modular construction of a large-scale array. Two designs are released: the initial $Thick$ version contains around 15% of Cu over the crystal mass (lithium molybdate, LMO), while this ratio is reduced to ~6% in a finer ($Slim$) design. Both designs were tested extensively at aboveground (IJCLab, France) and underground (LSC, Spain) laboratories. In particular, at LSC we used a pulse-tube-based CROSS facility to operate a 6-crystal array of LMOs enriched/depleted in $^{100}$Mo. The tested LMOs show high spectrometric performance in both designs; notably, the measured energy resolution is 5--7 keV FWHM at 2615 keV $\gamma$s, nearby the Q-value of $^{100}$Mo (3034 keV). Due to the absence of a reflective cavity around LMOs, a low scintillation signal is detected by Ge bolometers: ~0.3 keV (150 photons) for 1-MeV $\gamma$($\beta$) LMO-event. Despite that, an acceptable separation between $\alpha$ and $\gamma$($\beta$) events is achieved with most devices. The highest efficiency is reached with light detectors in the $Thick$ design thanks to a lower baseline noise width (0.05--0.09 keV RMS) when compared to that obtained in the $Slim$ version (0.10--0.35 keV RMS). Given the pivotal role of bolometric photodetectors for particle identification and random coincidences rejection, we will use the structure here described with upgraded light detectors, featuring thermal signal amplification via the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke effect, as also demonstrated in the present work.</description>

      <title>Development of large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers for the CROSS $2\beta$ decay search experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the development of thermal detectors based on large-size tellurium dioxide crystals (45x45x45 mm), containing tellurium enriched in $^{130}$Te to about 91%, for the CROSS double-beta decay experiment. A powder used for the crystals growth was additionally purified by the directional solidification method, resulting in the reduction of the concentration of impurities by a factor 10, to a few ppm of the total concentration of residual elements (the main impurity is Fe). The purest part of the ingot (the first ~200 mm, about 80% of the total length of the cylindrical part of the ingot) was determined by scanning segregation profiles of impurities and used for the $^{130}$TeO$_2$ powder production with no evidence of re-contamination. The crystal growth was verified with precursors produced from powder with natural Te isotopic composition, and two small-size (20x20x10 mm) samples were tested at a sea-level laboratory showing high bolometric and spectrometric performance together with acceptable $^{210}$Po content (below 10 mBq/kg). This growth method was then applied for the production of six large cubic $^{130}$TeO$_2$ crystals and 4 of them were taken randomly to be characterized at the Canfranc underground laboratory, in the CROSS-dedicated low-background cryogenic facility. Two $^{130}$TeO$_2$ samples were coated with a thin, $O$(100 nm), metal film in form of Al layer (on 4 sides) or AlPd grid (on a single side) to investigate the possibility to tag surface events by pulse-shape discrimination. Similarly to the small natural precursors, large-volume $^{130}$TeO$_2$ bolometers show high performance and even better internal purity ($^{210}$Po activity $\sim$ 1 mBq/kg, while activities of $^{228}$Th and $^{226}$Ra are below 0.01 mBq/kg), satisfying requirements for the CROSS and, potentially, next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and testing of Kinetic Inductance Detector package for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM) is designed to probe the star formation history in dust-obscured star-forming galaxies around the peak of cosmic star formation. This will be done via measurements of the redshifted 157.7 um line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]). TIM employs two R $\sim 250$ long-slit grating spectrometers covering 240-420 um. Each is equipped with a focal plane unit containing 4 wafer-sized subarrays of horn-coupled aluminum kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). We present the design and performance of a prototype focal plane assembly for one of TIM's KID-based subarrays. Our design strictly maintain high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. The prototype detector housing in combination with the first flight-like quadrant are tested at 250 mK. Initial frequency scan shows that many resonances are affected by collisions and/or very shallow transmission dips as a result of a degraded internal quality factor (Q factor). This is attributed to the presence of an external magnetic field during cooldown. We report on a study of magnetic field dependence of the Q factor of our quadrant array. We implement a Helmholtz coil to vary the magnetic field at the detectors by (partially) nulling earth's. Our investigation shows that the earth magnetic field can significantly affect our KIDs' performance by degrading the Q factor by a factor of 2-5, well below those expected from the operational temperature or optical loading. We find that we can sufficiently recover our detectors' quality factor by tuning the current in the coils to generate a field that matches earth's magnetic field in magnitude to within a few uT. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a properly designed magnetic shield enclosing the TIM focal plane unit. Based on the results presented in this paper, we set a shielding requirement of |B| &lt; 3 uT.</description>

      <title>Design of The Kinetic Inductance Detector Based Focal Plane Assembly for The Terahertz Intensity Mapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the kinetic inductance detector (KID) array focal plane assembly design for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). Each of the 2 arrays consists of 4 wafer-sized dies (quadrants), and the overall assembly must satisfy thermal and mechanical requirements, while maintaining high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. In particular, our design manages to strictly maintain a 50 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ air gap between the array and the horn block. We have prototyped and are now testing a sub-scale assembly which houses a single quadrant for characterization before integration into the full array. The initial test result shows a $&gt;$95% yield, indicating a good performance of our TIM detector packaging design.</description>

      <title>Investigating Resource-efficient Neutron/Gamma Classification ML Models Targeting eFPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable interest and resulting progress in implementing machine learning (ML) models in hardware over the last several years from the particle and nuclear physics communities. A big driver has been the release of the Python package, hls4ml, which has enabled porting models specified and trained using Python ML libraries to register transfer level (RTL) code. So far, the primary end targets have been commercial FPGAs or synthesized custom blocks on ASICs. However, recent developments in open-source embedded FPGA (eFPGA) frameworks now provide an alternate, more flexible pathway for implementing ML models in hardware. These customized eFPGA fabrics can be integrated as part of an overall chip design. In general, the decision between a fully custom, eFPGA, or commercial FPGA ML implementation will depend on the details of the end-use application. In this work, we explored the parameter space for eFPGA implementations of fully-connected neural network (fcNN) and boosted decision tree (BDT) models using the task of neutron/gamma classification with a specific focus on resource efficiency. We used data collected using an AmBe sealed source incident on Stilbene, which was optically coupled to an OnSemi J-series SiPM to generate training and test data for this study. We investigated relevant input features and the effects of bit-resolution and sampling rate as well as trade-offs in hyperparameters for both ML architectures while tracking total resource usage. The performance metric used to track model performance was the calculated neutron efficiency at a gamma leakage of 10$^{-3}$. The results of the study will be used to aid the specification of an eFPGA fabric, which will be integrated as part of a test chip.</description>

      <title>Development of Rotating Target with Ferrofluid Seal for ILC Electron-Driven Positron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ILC electron-driven positron source, acceleration tubes are located immediately downstream of the positron generation target to capture the generated positrons, necessitating high vacuum for their operation. We designed a rotating target using a ferrofluid rotating vacuum seal that can stably maintain a vacuum of $10^{-6}$ Pa and a tangential velocity of 5 m/sec, which meets the requirements of the ILC positron source. We fabricated a full-scale prototype and confirmed the compatibility of rotation and stable vacuum maintenance. Various tests on the radiation resistance of the ferrofluid demonstrated its ability to withstand six years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation without degradation and to continue exhibiting vacuum sealing performance. Radiation exposure tests on a small-scale target with a structure and material similar to the full-scale target confirmed its operability after two years of radiation exposure in normal ILC operation. The design, including thermal load, stress analysis, and cooling, led to the conclusion of an estimated lifespan of the target of over one year, based on comparison with the SLC target. These results demonstrate and establish the technology of positron generation targets in the ILC electron-driven positron source.</description>

      <title>Reactor-based Search for Axion-Like Particles using CsI(Tl) Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Null results for WIMP dark matter have led to increased interest in exploring other dark matter candidates, such as Axions and Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), which also helps in answering the strong CP problem. This experiment achieved a sub-100 DRU (differential-rate-unit, expressed in counts/keV/kg/day) background in the MeV region of interest by employing a combination of active and passive veto techniques. Such a low background facilitates the search for ALPs with axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma \gamma} &gt; 10^{-6}$ and axion-electron coupling $10^{-8}&lt; g_{aee} &lt; 10^{-4}$ in the 1 keV to 10 MeV mass range. This indicates that the experiment has the capability to constrain the unexplored cosmological triangle in the ALP-photon parameter space for ALPs in the MeV mass range.</description>
