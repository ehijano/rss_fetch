      <title>A q-Supercongruence Motivated by Higher-Order Generalized Lehmer-Euler Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain generalization of Euler numbers was defined in 1935 by Lehmer using cubic roots of unity, as a natural generalization of Bernoulli and Euler numbers. In this paper, we define a new polynomial related to the higher-order generalized Lehmer-Euler numbers and determine its a q-supercongruence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, Benoit Cloitre entered a bunch of sequences in the OEIS that we call \emph{hiccup} sequences. We collect the various claims, observations, and proofs of properties of these sequences that have been entered in the OEIS over the years, and present a unified approach, guided by a remarkable theorem of Bosma, Dekking, and Steiner.</description>

      <title>Planar-Toroidal Decomposition of $K_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1978, Anderson and White asked whether there is a decomposition of $K_{12}$ into two graphs, one planar and one toroidal. Using theoretical arguments and a computer search of all maximal planar graphs of order 12, we show that no such decomposition exists. We further show that if $G$ is planar of order 12 and $H\subseteq\overline{G}$ is toroidal, then $H$ has at least two fewer edges than $\overline{G}$. A computer search found all 123 unique pairs $\left(G,H\right)$ that make this an equality.</description>

      <title>Resolving Open Problems on the Euler Sombor Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Euler Sombor index $(EUS)$ was introduced as a novel degree-based topological index. For a graph $G$, the Euler Sombor index is defined as $$EUS(G) = \sum_{v_i v_j \in E(G)} \sqrt{d_i^2 + d_j^2 + d_i d_j},$$ where $d_i$ and $d_j$ denote the degrees of the vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$, respectively. Very recently, Khanra and Das \textbf{\bf [Euler Sombor index of trees, unicyclic and chemical graphs, \emph{MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem.} \textbf{94} (2025) 525--548]} proposed several open problems concerning the Euler Sombor index. This paper completely resolves two of the most challenging problems posed therein. First, we determine the minimum value of the $EUS$ index among all unicyclic graphs of a fixed order and prescribed girth, and we characterize the extremal graphs that attain this minimum. Building on this result, we further establish the minimum $EUS$ index within the broader class of connected graphs of the same order and girth, and identify the corresponding extremal structures. In addition, we classify all connected graphs that attain the maximum Euler Sombor index $(EUS)$ when both the order and the number of leaves are fixed.</description>

      <title>Bipartite graphs with minimum degree at least 15 are antimagic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antimagic {labeling} of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a one-to-one mapping $f: E\rightarrow\{1,2,\ldots,|E|\}$, ensuring that the vertex sums in $V$ are pairwise distinct, where a vertex sum of a vertex $v$ is defined as the sum of the labels of the edges incident to $v$. A graph is called antimagic if it admits an antimagic labeling. The Antimagic Labeling Conjecture, proposed by Hartsfield and Ringel in 1990, posits that every connected graph other than $K_2$ is antimagic. The conjecture was confirmed for graphs of average degree at least 4,182 in 2016 by Eccles, where it was stated that a similar approach could not reduce the bound below 1,000 from 4,182.
  This paper shows that every bipartite graph with minimum degree at least 15 is antimagic. Our approach relies on three tools: a consequence of K\"{o}nig's Theorem, the existence of a subgraph of a specific size that avoids Eulerian components, and a labeling lemma that ensures some vertex sums are divisible by three while others are not.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker total domination number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker total domination number, $\gamma_{\rm MBT}(G)$, of a graph $G$ is introduced as the minimum number of moves of Dominator to win the Maker-Breaker total domination game, provided that he has a winning strategy and is the first to play. The Staller-start Maker-Breaker total domination number, $\gamma_{\rm MBT}'(G)$, is defined analogously for the game in which Staller starts. Upper and lower bounds on $\gamma_{\rm MBT}(G)$ and on $\gamma_{\rm MBT}'(G)$ are provided and demonstrated to be sharp. It is proved that for any pair of integers $(k,\ell)$ with $2\leq k\leq \ell$, (i) there exists a connected graph $G$ with $\gamma_{\rm MB}(G)=k$ and $\gamma_{\rm MBT}(G)=\ell$, (ii) there exists a connected graph $G'$ with $\gamma_{\rm MB}'(G')=k$ and $\gamma_{\rm MBT}'(G')=\ell$, and (iii) there there exists a connected graph $G''$ with $\gamma_{\rm MBT}(G'')=k$ and $\gamma_{\rm MBT}'(G'')=\ell$. Here, $\gamma_{\rm MB}$ and $\gamma_{\rm MB}'$ are corresponding invariants for the Maker-Breaker domination game.</description>

      <title>Clustering, order conditions, and languages of interval exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any interval exchange transformation $T$ (standard or generalized), if we define a morphism $\phi$ from the set of letters to the
  set of the return words of a word in the natural coding, respecting the lexicographical order, the word $\phi v$ clusters (for the Burrows-Wheeler transform) for the permutation of $T$ if and only if the word $v$ clusters for the permutation of the induced map of $T$
  on the cylinder $[w]$. When $T$ is symmetrical, all such natural codings are rich languages, and this implies that the two orders above are the same if $w$ is a palindrome. Finally, we generalize the result, proved by using the clustering of a word $w$,
  that $ww$ is produced by a generalized interval exchange transformation if and only if $ww$ is produced by a standard interval exchange transformation, to non-clustering $w$: in the symmetric case, $w$ is produced by a
  generalized interval exchange transformation if and only if $w$ is produced by a standard interval exchange transformation.</description>

      <title>Non-isomorphic $d$-integral circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic degree $Deg(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the dimension of the splitting field of the adjacency polynomial of $G$ over the field $\mathbb{Q}$. It can be shown that for every positive integer $d$, there exists a circulant graph with algebraic degree $d$. Let $C(d)$ be the least positive integer such that there exists a circulant graph of order $C(d)$ having algebraic degree $d$. A graph $G$ is called $d$-integral if $Deg(G)=d$. We call a $d$-integral circulant graph \textit{minimal} if order of that graph equals $C(d)$. Let $\mathcal{F}_{n,d}$ denote the collection of isomorphism classes of connected, $d$-integral circulant graphs of some given possible order $n$. In this paper we compute the exact value of $C(d)$ and provide some bounds on $|\mathcal{F}_{n,d}|$, thereby showing that the minimal $d$-integral circulant graph is not unique. Moreover, we find the exact value of $|\mathcal{F}_{p,d}|$ where both $p$ and $d$ are prime.</description>

      <title>On the sum of the largest and smallest eigenvalues of odd-cycle free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency eigenvalues $\lambda_1 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n$. Both $\lambda_1 + \lambda_n$ and the odd girth of $G$ can be seen as measures of the bipartiteness of $G$. Csikv\'ari proved in 2022 that for odd girth 5 graphs (triangle-free) it holds that $(\lambda_1+\lambda_n)/n \le (3-2\sqrt 2) &lt; 0.1716$. In this paper we extend Csikv\'ari's result to general odd girth $k$ proving that $(\lambda_1+\lambda_n)/n = O(k^{-1})$. In the case of odd girth 7, we prove a stronger upper bound of $(\lambda_1+\lambda_n)/n &lt; 0.0396$.</description>

      <title>Approximating temporal modularity on graphs of small underlying treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modularity is a very widely used measure of the level of clustering or community structure in networks. Here we consider a recent generalisation of the definition of modularity to temporal graphs, whose edge-sets change over discrete timesteps; such graphs offer a more realistic model of many real-world networks in which connections between entities (for example, between individuals in a social network) evolve over time. Computing modularity is notoriously difficult: it is NP-hard even to approximate in general, and only admits efficient exact algorithms in very restricted special cases. Our main result is that a multiplicative approximation to temporal modularity can be computed efficiently when the underlying graph has small treewidth. This generalises a similar approximation algorithm for the static case, but requires some substantially new ideas to overcome technical challenges associated with the temporal nature of the problem.</description>

      <title>Exterior Cyclic Polytopes and Convexity of Amplituhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplituhedron is a semialgebraic set in the Grassmannian. We study convexity and duality of amplituhedra. We introduce a notion of convexity, called \textit{extendable convexity}, for real semialgebraic sets in any embedded projective variety. We show that the $k=m=2$ amplituhedron is extendably convex in the Grassmannian of lines in projective three-space. In the process we introduce a new polytope called the \emph{exterior cyclic polytope}, generalizing the cyclic polytope. It is equal to the convex hull of the amplituhedron in the Pl\"ucker embedding. We undertake a combinatorial analysis of the exterior cyclic polytope, its facets, and its dual. Finally, we introduce the \textit{(extendable) dual amplituhedron}, which is closely related to the dual of the exterior cyclic polytope. We show that the dual amplituhedron for $k=m=2$ is again an amplituhedron, where the external matrix data is changed by the twist map.</description>

      <title>On Maker-Breaker domination game critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker domination game is played on a graph $G$ by Dominator and Staller who alternate turns selecting an unplayed vertex of $G$. The goal of Dominator is that the vertices he selected during the game form a dominating set while Staller's goal is to prevent this from happening. The graph invariant $\gamma_{\rm MB}'(G)$ is the number of Dominator's moves in the game played on $G$ in which he can achieve his goal when Staller makes the first move and both players play optimally. In this paper, we continue the investigation of $2$-$\gamma_{\rm MB}'$-critical graphs, initiated in [Divarakan et al., Maker--Breaker domination game critical graphs, Discrete Appl.\ Math. 368 (2025) 126--134], which are defined as the graphs $G$ with $\gamma_{\rm MB}'(G)=2$ and $\gamma_{\rm MB}'(G-e)&gt;2$ for every edge $e$ in $G$. The authors characterized bipartite $2$-$\gamma_{\rm MB}'$-critical graphs, and found an example of a non-bipartite $2$-$\gamma_{\rm MB}'$-critical graph. In this paper, we characterize the $2$-$\gamma_{\rm MB}'$-critical graphs that have a cut-vertex, which are represented by two infinite families. In addition, we prove that $C_5$ is the only non-bipartite, triangle-free $2$-$\gamma_{\rm MB}'$-critical graph.</description>

      <title>Symmetric decompositions and Euler-Stirling statistics on Stirling permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stirling permutations introduced by Gessel-Stanley have recently received considerable attention. Motivated by Ji's recent work on Euler-Stirling statistics of permutations (Sci China Math., 2025), we present several symmetric decompositions of the enumerators related to Euler-Stirling statistics of Stirling permutations. Firstly, we provide a partial symmetric decomposition for the $1/k$-Eulerian polynomial. Secondly, we give several unexpected applications of the $(p,q)$-Eulerian polynomials, where $p$ marks the number of fixed points and $q$ marks that of cycles. Using the change of grammars, we show that the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Eulerian polynomials introduced by Carlitz-Scoville can be deduced from the $(p,q)$-Eulerian polynomials by special parametrizations. We then introduce proper and improper ascent-plateau statistics on Stirling permutations. Moreover, we introduce proper ascent, improper ascent, proper descent and improper descent statistics on permutations. Furthermore, we consider the joint distributions of Euler-Stirling statistics on permutations, including the numbers of improper ascents, proper ascents, left-to-right minima and right-to-left minina. In the final part, we first give a symmetric decomposition of the joint distribution of the ascent-plateau and left ascent-plateau statistics, and then we show that the $q$-ascent-plateau polynomials are bi-$\gamma$-positive, where $q$ marks the number of left-to-right minima.</description>

      <title>Optimal stability results on color-biased Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Hamilton cycles in edge-colored graphs with \( r \) colors, focusing on the notion of color-bias (discrepancy), the maximum deviation from uniform color frequencies along a cycle. Foundational work by Balogh, Csaba, Jing, and Pluh\'{a}r, and the later generalization by Freschi, Hyde, Lada, and Treglown, as well as an independent work by Gishboliner, Krivelevich, and Michaeli, established that any \(n\)-vertex graph with minimum degree exceeding \( \frac{(r+1)n}{2r} + \frac{m}{2}\) contains a Hamilton cycle with color-bias at least \(m\), and characterized the extremal graphs with minimum degree \(\frac{(r+1)n}{2r}\) in which all Hamilton cycles are perfectly balanced.
  We prove the optimal stability results: for any positive integers \(r\ge 2\) and \( m &lt; 2^{-6} r^{2} n,\) if every Hamilton cycle in an \( n \)-vertex graph with minimum degree exceeding \( \frac{n}{2} + 6r^{2}m \) has color-bias less than \( m \), then the graph must closely resemble the extremal constructions of Freschi, Hyde, Lada, and Treglown. The leading term \( \frac{n}{2} \) in the degree condition is optimal, as it is the sharp threshold for guaranteeing Hamiltonicity. Moreover, we show the additive error term \(\Theta(m)\) is also best possible when \(m\) is large and \(r=2\), since weaker condition $\frac{n}{2}+o(m)$ allow for a counterexample. Notably, the structural stability threshold \( \frac{1}{2} \) lies strictly below the extremal threshold \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2r} \) required to force color imbalance. Our proof leverages local configurations to deduce global structure, revealing a rigid combinatorial dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of asymmetric gelation between three walks on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different
  polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a
  scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find
  the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star
  configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights,
  so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a
  different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating
  stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional
  equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly
  walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same
  techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find
  the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the
  entropic exponents in each phase.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Phylogenetic Level-2 Networks with Quartets and Inter-Taxon Quartet Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of phylogenetic networks, which model complex evolutionary processes including hybridization and gene flow, remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. Until now, statistically consistent inference methods have been limited to phylogenetic level-1 networks, which allow no interdependence between reticulate events. In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for a statistically consistent inference method for a much broader class: semi-directed level-2 networks that are outer-labeled planar and galled. We precisely characterize the features of these networks that are distinguishable from the topologies of their displayed quartet trees. Moreover, we prove that an inter-taxon distance derived from these quartets is circular decomposable, enabling future robust inference of these networks from quartet data, such as concordance factors obtained from gene tree distributions under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model. Our results also have novel identifiability implications across different data types and evolutionary models, applying to any setting in which displayed quartets can be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Some questions on entangled linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled linear orders were first introduced by Abraham and Shelah. Todor\v{c}evi\'c showed that these linear orders exist under $\mathsf{CH}$. We prove the following results: (1) If $\mathsf{CH}$ holds, then, for every $n &gt; 0$, there is an $n$-entangled linear order which is not $(n+1)$-entangled. (2) If $\mathsf{CH}$ holds, then there are two homeomorphic sets of reals $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $A$ is entangled but $B$ is not $2$-entangled. (3) If $\mathbb{R}\subseteq \mathrm{L}$, then there is an entangled $\Pi_1^1$ set of reals. (4) If $\diamondsuit$ holds, then there is a $2$-entangled non-separable linear order.</description>

      <title>Partial permutohedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial permutohedra are lattice polytopes which were recently introduced and studied by Heuer and Striker. For positive integers $m$ and $n$, the partial permutohedron $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ is the convex hull of all vectors in $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}^m$ whose nonzero entries are distinct. We study the face lattice, volume and Ehrhart polynomial of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$, and our methods and results include the following. For any $m$ and $n$, we obtain a bijection between the nonempty faces of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ and certain chains of subsets of $\{1,\dots,m\}$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Heuer and Striker, and we then use this characterization of faces to obtain a closed expression for the $h$-polynomial of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$. For any $m$ and $n$ with $n\ge m-1$, we use a pyramidal subdivision of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ to establish a recursive formula for the normalized volume of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$, from which we then obtain closed expressions for this volume. We also use a sculpting process (in which $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ is reached by successively removing certain pieces from a simplex or hypercube) to obtain closed expressions for the Ehrhart polynomial of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ with arbitrary $m$ and fixed $n\le 3$, the normalized volume of $\mathcal{P}(m,4)$ with arbitrary $m$, and the Ehrhart polynomial of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ with fixed $m\le4$ and arbitrary $n\ge m-1$.</description>

Abstract: We resolve the open problem of characterizing the Frobenius number $g(A)$ for shifted square sequences $A = (a, a+1^2, \ldots, a+k^2)$, confirming a conjecture of Einstein et al. (2007). By combining a combinatorial reduction to an optimization problem with Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem and generating function techniques, we derive an explicit formula for $g(A)$: a piecewise quadratic polynomial in $a$, classified by residue classes modulo $k^2$.</description>

      <title>Borsuk and V\'azsonyi problems through Reuleaux polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Borsuk conjecture and the V\'azsonyi problem are two attractive and famous questions in discrete and combinatorial geometry, both based on the notion of diameter of a bounded sets. In this paper, we present an equivalence between the critical sets with Borsuk number 4 in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the minimal structures for the V\'azsonyi problem by using the well-known Reuleaux polyhedra. The latter lead to a full characterization of all finite sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Borsuk number 4.
  The proof of such equivalence needs various ingredients, in particular, we proved a conjecture dealing with strongly critical configuration for the V\'azsonyi problem and showed that the diameter graph arising from involutive polyhedra is vertex (and edge) 4-critical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a plane elementary bipartite graph whose infinite face is forcing. We show that there is a bijection between the set of maximal resonant sets of $G$ and the set of maximal hypercubes of its resonance graph $R(G)$. Moreover, if $G$ is a peripherally 2-colorable graph whose inner dual is $G^*$, we then establish a bijection between the set of maximal hypercubes of its resonance graph $R(G)$ and the set of maximal independent sets of $G^*$. Next, we present a characterization on when the resonance graph of a plane elementary bipartite graph $G$ is a daisy cube in terms of the daisy cube constructed from the set of all independent sets of $G^*$. The obtained result is also extended to plane weakly elementary bipartite graphs. Finally, two algorithms which provide a proper labelling for the vertex set of $R(G)$ as a daisy cube are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the slices or sections of a convex polytope by affine hyperplanes. We present results on two key problems: First, we provide tight bounds on the maximum number of vertices attainable by a hyperplane slice of $d$-polytope (a sort of upper bound theorem) and discuss a new algorithm to find all sections. Second, we investigate the sequence of numbers of vertices produced by the different slices over all possible hyperplanes and analyze the gaps that arise in that sequence. We study these sequences for three-dimensional polytopes and for hypercubes. Our results were obtained with the help of large computational experiments, and we report on new data generated for hypercubes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known problem stated by A. Meir and L. Moser consists in tiling the unit square with rectangles (details), whose side lengths equal $1/n\times 1/(n+1)$, where indices~$n$ range from 1 to infinity. Recently, Terence Tao has proved that it is possible to tile with $1/n^t\times 1/(n+1)^t$ rectangles (squares with the side length of $1/n^t$), $1/2&lt;t&lt;1$, the square, whose area equals the sum of areas of these details, provided that only those details, whose indices exceed certain~$n_0$, are taken into consideration. We adduce arguments in favor of the assumption that the result obtained by T. Tao is also valid for $t=1$. We use a new tiling method (the Slack-Pack algorithm), which initially admits gaps between stacks of details. The algorithm uses a pre-fixed parameter $\gamma$, $\sqrt{3/2}&lt;\gamma&lt;3/2$, connected with the gap value. The new algorithm allows one to control the ratio of the area of the large rectangular part, which is free of details, to the whole area of the remaining empty space. This ratio (under certain natural assumptions) always exceeds $1-1/\gamma-\delta$, where $\delta$ tends to zero as $n_0$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We fully characterize the set of finite shapes with minimal perimeter on hyperbolic lattices given by regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane whose tiles are regular $p$-gons meeting at vertices of degree $q$, with $1/p+1/q&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. In particular, we prove that the ratio between the perimeter and the area (i.e., the number of vertices) of this set of minimal shapes converges to the isoperimetric constant computed in H\"aggstr\"om-Jonasson-Lyons. In fact, our balls which are constructed via layers and not combinatorial balls, will realize the isoperimetric constant for any fixed number of vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected bridgeless graph with domination number $\gamma$. The oriented diameter (strong diameter) of $G$ is the smallest integer $d$ for which $G$ admits a strong orientation with diameter (strong diameter) $d$. Kurz and L\"atsch (2012) conjectured the oriented diameter of $G$ is at most $\lceil \frac{7\gamma+1}{2}\rceil$ and the bound is sharp. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture by induction on $\gamma$ through contracting an unavoidable alternative subgraph, which holds potential for future applications. Moreover, we show the oriented strong diameter of $G$ is at most $7\gamma-1$ by using the same recursive structure, and the bound is best possible.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a 3-graph on $n$ vertices. The matching number $\nu(\mathcal{H})$ is defined as the maximum number of disjoint edges in $\mathcal{H}$. The generalized triangle $F_5$ is a 3-graph on the vertex set $\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ with the edge set $\{abc, abd,cde\}$. In this paper, we showed that an $F_5$-free 3-graph $\mathcal{H}$ with matching number at most $s$ has at most $s\lfloor (n-s)^2/4\rfloor$ edges for $n\geq 30(s+1)$ and $s\geq 3$. For the proof, we establish a 2-colored version of Mantel's theorem, which may be of independent interests.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we refine a result of Andrews and Newman, that is, the sum of minimal excludants over all the partitions of a number $n$ equals the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct parts with two colors. As a consequence, we find congruences modulo 4 and 8 for the functions appearing in this refinement. We also conjecture three further congruences for these functions. In addition, we also initiate the study of $k^{th}$ moments of minimal excludants. At the end, we also provide an alternate proof of a beautiful identity due to Hopkins, Sellers and Stanton.</description>

      <title>Polymatroid Schubert varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lattice of flats $\mathcal L_M$ of a matroid $M$ is combinatorially well-behaved and, when $M$ is realizable, admits a geometric model in the form of a "matroid Schubert variety". In contrast, the lattice of flats of a polymatroid exhibits many combinatorial pathologies and admits no similar geometric model.
  We address this situation by defining the lattice $\mathcal L_P$ of "combinatorial flats" of a polymatroid $P$. Combinatorially, $\mathcal L_P$ exhibits good behavior analogous to that of $\mathcal L_M$: it is graded, determines $P$ when $P$ is simple, and is top-heavy. When $P$ is realizable over a field of characteristic 0, we show that $\mathcal L_P$ is modelled by a "polymatroid Schubert variety".
  Our work generalizes a number of results of Ardila-Boocher and Huh-Wang on matroid Schubert varieties; however, the geometry of polymatroid Schubert varieties is noticeably more complicated than that of matroid Schubert varieties. Many natural questions remain open.</description>

Abstract: Many invariants of finitely generated positive cancelative commutative semigroups can be studied from their Poincar\'e series. We offer and present several closed formulas for them. Moreover, those formulas have elementary proofs and are presented in two distinct forms: one characterized in terms of simplicial complexes and the other by a purely set theoretical approach.</description>
