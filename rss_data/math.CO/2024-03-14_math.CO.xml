      <title>Boolean intervals in the weak Bruhat order of a finite Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Coxeter group $W$ with Coxeter system $(W,S)$, where $S$ is finite. We provide a complete characterization of Boolean intervals in the weak order of $W$ uniformly for all Coxeter groups in terms of independent sets of the Coxeter graph. Moreover, we establish that the number of Boolean intervals of rank $k$ in the weak order of $W$ is ${i_k(\Gamma_W)\cdot|W|}\,/\,2^{k}$, where $\Gamma_W$ is the Coxeter graph of $W$ and $i_k(\Gamma_W)$ is the number of independent sets of size $k$ of $\Gamma_W$ when $W$ is finite. Specializing to $A_n$, we recover the characterizations and enumerations of Boolean intervals in the weak order of $A_n$ given in arXiv:2306.14734. We provide the analogous results for types $C_n$ and $D_n$, including the related generating functions and additional connections to well-known integer sequences.</description>

      <title>Minimal reconstructions of a coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coloring on a finite or countable set $X$ is a function $\varphi: [X]^{2} \to \{0,1\}$, where $[X]^{2}$ is the collection of unordered pairs of $X$. The collection of homogeneous sets for $\varphi$, denoted by $Hom(\varphi)$, consist of all $H \subseteq X$ such that $\varphi$ is constant on $[H]^2$; clearly, $Hom(\varphi) = Hom(1-\varphi)$. A coloring $\varphi$ is \textit{reconstructible} up to complementation from its homogeneous sets if, for any coloring $\psi$ on $X$ such that $Hom(\varphi) = Hom(\psi)$, either $\psi = \varphi$ or $\psi = 1-\varphi$. By $\mathcal{R}$ we denote the collection of all colorings reconstructible from their homogeneous sets. Let $\varphi$ and $\psi$ be colorings on $X$, and set \[ D(\varphi, \psi) = \{ \{x,y\} \in [X]^2: \; \psi\{x,y\} \neq \varphi\{x,y\}\}. \] If $\varphi\not\in \mathcal{R}$, let \[ r(\varphi) = \min\{|D(\varphi, \psi)|: \; Hom(\varphi) = Hom(\psi), \, \psi \neq \varphi, \, \psi \neq 1-\varphi\}. \] A coloring $\psi$ such that $Hom(\varphi)=Hom(\psi)$, $\varphi\neq \psi$ and $1-\varphi\neq \psi$ is called a {\em non trivial reconstruction} of $\varphi$. If, in addition, $r(\varphi) =|D(\varphi, \psi)|$, we call $\psi$ a {\em minimal reconstruction} of $\varphi$. The purpose of this article is to study the minimal reconstructions of a coloring. We show that, for large enough $X$, $r(\varphi)$ can only takes the values $1$ or $4$.</description>

      <title>Progressive and rushed Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call progressive paths and rushed paths two families of Dyck paths studied by Asinowski and Jel\'inek, which have the same enumerating sequence (OEIS entry A287709). We present a bijection proving this fact. Rushed paths turn out to be in bijection with \emph{one-sided trees}, introduced by Durhuus and \"Unel, which have an asymptotic enumeration involving a stretched exponential. We conclude by presenting several other classes of related lattice paths and directed animals that may have similar asymptotic properties.</description>

      <title>An exact upper bound for the minimum size of a path system that weakly separates a clique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for each natural number $n$ the clique $K_n$ has a weakly separating path system of size $n+2$, improving the previous best known upper bound of $(1+o(1))n$. Since $n-1$ is a lower bound, this is almost tight.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal and polynomial R\"odl and Nikiforov conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that polynomial versions of theorems of R\"odl and Nikiforov, as conjectured by Fox and Sudakov and Nguyen, Scott and Seymour imply the classical Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture. In this note, we prove that these three conjectures are in fact equivalent, extending several previous particular results in this direction by Fox, Nguyen, Scott and Seymour; Nguyen, Scott and Seymour and Gishboliner and Shapira. We deduce that the family of string graphs satisfies the polynomial R\"odl conjecture.</description>

      <title>Freeness of hyperplane arrangements associated with gain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Athanasiadis studied arrangements obtained by adding shifted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. Bailey studied arrangements obtained by adding tilted hyperplanes to the braid arrangement. These two kinds of arrangements are associated with directed graphs and their freeness was characterized in terms of the graphs. The results show coincidence of freeness. Namely, if Athanasiadis' arrangement is free, then the corresponding Bailey's arrangement is free, and vice versa.
  In this paper, we generalize this phenomenon by using gain graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a construction of the induced subgraphs of the zero-divisor graph of $M_2(R)$ for the ring $R$ of algebraic integers of some number fields that are neither complete nor connected, and study the structure of the induced subgraphs explicitly. As an application, we prove that the automorphism group of the zero-divisor graph of $M_2(R)$ is not a Jordan group.</description>

      <title>Solution on strong partition of $2$-balanced regular multipartite tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a partition of a $c$-partite tournament into tournaments of order $c$ is strong if each tournament is strongly connected. The strong partition number denoted as $ST(r)$, represents the minimum integer $c'$ such that every regular $r$-balanced $c$-partite tournament has a strong partition with $c\geq c'$. Figueroa, Montellano-Ballesteros and Olsen showed the existence of $ST(r)$ for all $r\geq 2$ and proved that $5\leq ST(2)\leq 7$. In this note, we establish that $ST(2)=6$ and we also show the unique $2$-balanced $5$-partite tournament which has no strong partition.</description>

      <title>Centrality of star and monotone factorisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A factorisation problem in the symmetric group is central if any two permutations in the same conjugacy class have the same number of factorisations. We give the first fully combinatorial proof of the centrality of transitive star factorisations that is valid in all genera, which answers a natural question of Goulden and Jackson from 2009. Our proof is through a bijection to a class of monotone double Hurwitz factorisations. These latter factorisations are also not obviously central, so we also give a combinatorial proof of their centrality. As a corollary we obtain new formulae for some monotone double Hurwitz numbers, and a new relation between Hurwitz and monotone Hurwitz numbers. We also generalise a theorem of Goulden and Jackson from 2009 that states that the transitive power of Jucys-Murphy elements are central. Our theorem states that the transitive image of any symmetric function evaluated at Jucys-Murphy elements is central, which gives a transitive version of Jucys' original result from 1974.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic on $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko introduced a $q$-analog of rational numbers. More precisely, for an irreducible fraction $\frac{r}s&gt;0$, they constructed coprime polynomials ${\mathcal R}_{\frac{r}s}(q), {\mathcal S}_{\frac{r}s}(q) \in {\mathbb Z}[q]$ with ${\mathcal R}_{\frac{r}s}(1)=r, {\mathcal S}_{\frac{r}s}(1)=s$. Their theory has a rich background and many applications. By definition, if $r \equiv r' \pmod{s}$, then ${\mathcal S}_{\frac{r}s}(q)={\mathcal S}_{\frac{r'}s}(q)$. We show that $rr'=-1 \pmod{s}$ implies ${\mathcal S}_{\frac{r}s}(q)={\mathcal S}_{\frac{r'}s}(q)$, and it is conjectured that the converse holds if $s$ is prime (and $r \not \equiv r' \pmod{s}$). We also show that $s$ is a multiple of 3 (resp. 4) if and only if ${\mathcal S}_{\frac{r}s}(\zeta)=0$ for $\zeta=(-1+\sqrt{-3})/2$ (resp. $\zeta=i$). We give applications to the representation theory of quivers of type $A$ and the Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>

      <title>New Invariants for Partitioning a Graph into 2-connected Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex partition in which every part induces a 2-connected subgraph is called a 2-proper partition. This concept was introduced by Ferrara et al. in 2013, and Borozan et al. gave the best possible minimum degree condition for the existence of a 2-proper partition in 2016. Later, in 2022, Chen et al. extended the result by showing a minimum degree sum condition for the existence of 2-proper partition. In this paper, we introduce two new invariants of graph, denoted by $\sigma^*(G)$ and $\alpha^*(G)$. These two invariants are defined from degree sum on all independent sets with some property. We prove that if a graph $G$ satisfies $\sigma^*(G)\geq |V(G)|$, then with some exceptions, $G$ has a 2-proper partition with at most $\alpha^*(G)$ parts. This result is best possible, and implies both of the results by Borozan et al. and by Chen et al.. Moreover, as a corollary of our result, we give a minimum degree product condition for the existence of a 2-proper partition.</description>

Abstract: The Terwilliger algebras of association schemes over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$ were called the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of association schemes in [8]. In this paper, we study the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial association schemes. We determine the $\mathbb{F}$-dimensions, the centers, the semisimplicity, the Jacobson radicals, and the algebraic structures of the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of factorial association schemes.</description>

      <title>The q-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any positive integer $q\geq 2$ and any real number $\delta\in(0,1)$, let $\alpha_q(n,\delta n)$ denote the maximum size of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with minimum Hamming distance at least $\delta n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dotsc,q-1\}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The asymptotic rate function is defined by $ R_q(\delta) = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q\alpha_q(n,\delta n). $ The famous $q$-ary asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that \[ R_q(\delta) \geq 1 - \delta\log_q(q-1)-\delta\log_q\frac{1}{\delta}-(1-\delta)\log_q\frac{1}{1-\delta} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q) \] for all positive integers $q\geq 2$ and $0&lt;\delta&lt;1-q^{-1}$. In the case that $q$ is an even power of a prime with $q\geq 49$, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. The further investigation in algebraic geometry codes has shown that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can also be improved in the case that $q$ is an odd power of a prime but not a prime with $q &gt; 125$. However, it remains a long-standing open problem whether the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound would be tight for those infinitely many integers $q$ which is a prime, except for Fermat primes not less than 257, and which is a generic positive integer not being a prime power.
  In this paper, we prove that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers $q\geq 2$. It is shown that $ R_q(1/2) &gt; R_\mathrm{GV}(1/2,q) $ for all integers $q &gt; \exp(29)$. Furthermore, we show that the growth of the rate function $R_q(\delta)$ for $\delta\in(0,1)$ fixed and $q$ growing large has a nontrivial lower bound. These new lower bounds are achieved by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s.</description>

      <title>Point-variety incidences, unit distances and Zarankiewicz's problem for algebraic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the number of incidences between $m$ points and $n$ varieties in $\mathbb{F}^d$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is an arbitrary field, assuming the incidence graph contains no copy of $K_{s,s}$. We also consider the analogous problem for algebraically defined graphs and unit distance graphs.
  First, we prove that if $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of $m$ points and $\mathcal{V}$ is a set of $n$ varieties in $\mathbb{F}^{D}$, each of dimension $d$ and degree at most $\Delta$, and in addition the incidence graph is $K_{s,s}$-free, then the number of incidences satisfies $I(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{V})\leq O_{d,\Delta, s}(m^{\frac{d}{d+1}} n+m)$. This bound is tight when $s,\Delta$ are sufficiently large with respect to $d$, with an appropriate choice of $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}(m,n)$. We give two proofs of this upper bound, one based on the framework of the induced Tur\'an problems and the other based on VC-dimension theory. In the second proof, we extend the celebrated result of R\'onyai, Babai and Ganapathy on the number of zero-patterns of polynomials to the context of varieties, which might be of independent interest.
  We also resolve the problem of finding the maximum number of unit distances which can be spanned by a set of $n$ points $\mathcal{P}$ in $\mathbb{F^d}$ whose unit-distance graph is $K_{s, s}$-free, showing that it is $\Theta_{d,s}(n^{2-\frac{1}{\lceil d/2\rceil +1}})$.
  Finally, we obtain tight bounds on the maximum number of edges of a $K_{s, s}$-free algebraic graph defined over a finite field, thus resolving the Zarankiewicz problem for this class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of integer programming and the $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration $\mathcal{I}=\{I_{[k]}\}_{k\ge0}$ is introduced. Under the assumption that $\mathcal{I}$ is Noetherian, we prove that the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(I_{[k]})$ is an eventually quasi-linear function. This result applies to several situations, including ordinary powers, and integral closures of ordinary powers, among others. As another application, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain integer programming problems. Finally, we present the Macaulay2 package \texttt{VNumber}.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature.The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>P\'osa-type results for Berge-hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Berge cycle of length $k$ in a hypergraph $\mathcal H$ is a sequence of distinct vertices and hyperedges $v_1,h_1,v_2,h_2,\dots,v_{k},h_k$ such that $v_{i},v_{i+1}\in h_i$ for all $i\in[k]$, indices taken modulo $k$. F\"uredi, Kostochka and Luo recently gave sharp Dirac-type minimum degree conditions that force non-uniform hypergraphs to have Hamiltonian Berge cycles. We give a sharp P\'osa-type lower bound for $r$-uniform and non-uniform hypergraphs that force Hamiltonian Berge cycles.</description>

      <title>Bounding Clique Size in Squares of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wegner conjectured that if $G$ is a planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 8$, then $\chi(G^2)\le \left\lfloor \frac32\Delta\right\rfloor +1$. This problem has received much attention, but remains open for all $\Delta\ge 8$. Here we prove an analogous bound on $\omega(G^2)$: If $G$ is a plane graph with $\Delta(G)\ge 36$, then $\omega(G^2)\le \lfloor\frac32\Delta(G)\rfloor+1$. In fact, this is a corollary of the following lemma, which is our main result. If $G$ is a plane graph with $\Delta(G)\ge 19$ and $S$ is a maximal clique in $G^2$ with $|S|\ge \Delta(G)+20$, then there exist $x,y,z\in V(G)$ such that $S=\{w:|N[w]\cap\{x,y,z\}|\ge 2\}$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of tensor products over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study finite dimensional algebras, in particular finite semifields, through their correspondence with nonsingular threefold tensors. We introduce a alternative embedding of the tensor product space into a projective space. This model allows us to understand tensors and their contractions in a new geometric way, relating the contraction of a tensor with a natural subspace of a subgeometry. This leads us to new results on invariants and classifications of tensors and algebras and on nonsingular fourfold tensors. A detailed study of the geometry of this setup for the case of the threefold tensor power of a vector space of dimension two over a finite field surprisingly leads to a new construction of quasi-hermitian varieties in $\mathrm{PG}(3,q^2)$.</description>

      <title>Commutative B\_infty -algebras are shuffle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We here construct an explicit isomorphism between any commutative Hopf algebra which underlying coalgebra is the tensor coalgebra of a space $V$ and the shuffle algebra based on the same space. This isomorphism uses the commutative $B_\infty$ structure that governs the product and the eulerian idempotent, as well as the canonical projection on the space $V$. This generalizes Homan's isomorphism between commutative quasi-shuffle and shuffle algebras, which correspond to the case when the $B_\infty$ structure is given by an associative and commutative product. We develop several examples in details, including the Hopf algebra of finite topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ is a graph with vertex set $\{0,1\}^n$ and there is an edge between two vertices if they differ in exactly one coordinate. For any graph $H$, define $\text{ex}(Q_n,H)$ to be the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of $Q_n$ without a copy of $H$. In this short note, we prove that for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ $$\text{ex}(Q_n, C_{10}) &gt; 0.024 \cdot e(Q_n).$$ Our construction is strongly inspired by the recent breakthrough work of Ellis, Ivan, and Leader, who showed that "daisy" hypergraphs have positive Tur\'an density with an extremely clever and simple linear-algebraic argument.</description>

      <title>A Lower bound for Secure Domination Number of an Outerplanar Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a secure dominating set of $G$ if $S$ is a dominating set of $G$ and, for each vertex $u \not\in S$, there is a vertex $v \in S$ such that $uv$ is an edge and $(S \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ is also a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{s}(G)$, is the cardinality of a smallest secure dominating sets of $G$. In this paper, we prove that for any outerplanar graph with $n \geq 4$ vertices, $\gamma_{s}(G) \geq (n+4)/5$ and the bound is tight.</description>

      <title>The $K_{1,2}$-structure-connectivity of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly investigate $K_{1,2}$-structure-connectivity for any connected graph. Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices, we show that $\kappa(G; K_{1,2})$ is well-defined if $diam(G)\geq 4$, or $n\equiv 1\pmod 3$, or $G\notin \{C_{5},K_{n}\}$ when $n\equiv 2\pmod 3$, or there exist three vertices $u,v,w$ such that $N_{G}(u)\cap (N_{G}(v,w)\cup\{v,w\})=\emptyset$ when $n\equiv 0\pmod 3$. Furthermore, if $G$ has $K_{1,2}$-structure-cut, we prove $\kappa(G)/3\leq\kappa(G; K_{1,2})\leq\kappa(G)$.</description>

      <title>Explicit statement of a conjecture on resultantal varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper [GLZ] "L-functions of Carlitz modules, resultantal varieties and rooted binary trees" is devoted to a description of some resultantal varieties related to L-functions of Carlitz modules. It contains a conjecture that some of these varieties coincide. This conjecture can be formulated in terms of polynomials, namely, in terms of a fact that an explicitly defined polynomial belongs to the radical of the ideal generated by some other polynomials. We give an explicit statement of this conjecture and a numerical result.</description>

      <title>Random matrices associated to Young diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular values of certain Young diagram shaped random matrices. For block-shaped random matrices, the empirical distribution of the squares of the singular eigenvalues converges almost surely to a distribution whose moments are a generalisation of the Catalan numbers. The limiting distribution is the density of a product of rescaled independent Beta random variables and its Stieltjes-Cauchy transform has a hypergeometric representation. In special cases we recover the Marchenko-Pastur and Dykema-Haagerup measures of square and triangular random matrices, respectively. We find a further factorisation of the moments in terms of two complex-valued random variables that generalises the factorisation of the Marcenko-Pastur law as product of independent uniform and arcsine random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homogeneity aspects of metric spaces in which all triples of distinct points admit pairwise different distances; such spaces are called isosceles-free. In particular, we characterize all homogeneous isosceles-free spaces up to isometry as vector spaces over the two-element field, endowed with an injective norm. Using isosceles-free decompositions, we provide bounds on the maximal number of distances in arbitrary homogeneous finite metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Tilted biorthogonal ensembles, Grothendieck random partitions, and determinantal tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study probability measures on partitions based on symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. These deformations of Schur polynomials introduced in the K-theory of Grassmannians share many common properties. Our Grothendieck measures are analogs of the Schur measures on partitions introduced by Okounkov (arXiv:math/9907127 [math.RT]). Despite the similarity of determinantal formulas for the probability weights of Schur and Grothendieck measures, we demonstrate that Grothendieck measures are \emph{not} determinantal point processes. This question is related to the principal minor assignment problem in algebraic geometry, and we employ a determinantal test first obtained by Nanson in 1897 for the $4\times4$ problem. We also propose a procedure for getting Nanson-like determinantal tests for matrices of any size $n\ge4$ which appear new for $n\ge 5$.
  By placing the Grothendieck measures into a new framework of tilted biorthogonal ensembles generalizing a rich class of determinantal processes introduced by Borodin (arXiv:math/9804027 [math.CA]), we identify Grothendieck random partitions as a cross-section of a Schur process, a determinantal process in two dimensions. This identification expresses the correlation functions of Grothendieck measures through sums of Fredholm determinants, which are not immediately suitable for asymptotic analysis. A more direct approach allows us to obtain a limit shape result for the Grothendieck random partitions. The limit shape curve is not particularly explicit as it arises as a cross-section of the limit shape surface for the Schur process. The gradient of this surface is expressed through the argument of a complex root of a cubic equation.</description>
