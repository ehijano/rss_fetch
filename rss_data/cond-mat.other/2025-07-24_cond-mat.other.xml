      <title>Giant Damping-like Torque Efficiency via Synergistic Spin Hall and enhanced Orbital Hall Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) has emerged as a promising method for achieving energy-efficient magnetisation switching in advanced spintronic devices. Over the past two decades, researchers have primarily focused on enhancing spin current generation through the spin Hall effect, relying predominantly on the spin degree of freedom (DoF) of the electron, while neglecting its orbital counterpart. Orbital Hall effect depends critically on the crystallinity and the interface between the orbital Hall layer and the orbital-to-spin conversion layer. However, most experimental works on orbital Hall effect relied on polycrystalline films with no special attention to improve the crystallographic texture. In this work, we have grown the Ru layer on a NiW seedlayer, which helped to improve the crystallographic texture, thereby enhancing the switching efficiency by over 44%. Such a huge increase in switching efficiency was achieved by (i) improving crystallographic texture and (ii) leveraging both spin and orbital DoFs. Our study underscores the potential for improving the spin-torque efficiency by combining interface engineering, orbital and spin Hall effects to drive next-generation spintronics.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are suppressed while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes - without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</description>
