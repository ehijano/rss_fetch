      <title>Improved Bounds for Context-Dependent Evolutionary Models Using Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical inference in evolutionary models with site-dependence is a long-standing challenge in phylogenetics and computational biology. We consider the problem of approximating marginal sequence likelihoods under dependent-site models of biological sequence evolution. We prove a polynomial mixing time bound for a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that samples the conditional distribution over latent sample paths, when the chain is initialized with a warm start. We then introduce a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for approximating the marginal likelihood, and show that our mixing time bound can be combined with recent importance sampling and finite-sample SMC results to obtain bounds on the finite sample approximation error of the resulting estimator. Our results show that the proposed SMC algorithm yields an efficient randomized approximation scheme for many practical problems of interest, and offers a significant improvement over a recently developed importance sampler for this problem. Our approach combines recent innovations in obtaining bounds for MCMC and SMC samplers, and may prove applicable to other problems of approximating marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Diffusion Model for Learnring Dynamics from Marginal Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based generative models learn transformations from a simple Gaussian to complex data distributions. To generalize these transformations between arbitrary distributions, recent work has focused on the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem. However, SB solutions are rarely available in closed form, and existing methods rely on iterative stochastic simulations that are often unstable and costly. We introduce a closed-form framework for learning SB dynamics that unifies and extends previously known closed-form solutions, including the Schr\"odinger F\"ollmer process and the Gaussian SB. Notably, the classical Gaussian SB solution arises as an immediate corollary of our formulation. Based on this result, we develop a simulation-free algorithm that directly infers SB dynamics from samples of the source and target distributions. We demonstrate the approach in modeling single-cell developmental trajectories and in image restoration tasks such as inpainting and deblurring.</description>

      <title>gemlib: Probabilistic programming for epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: gemlib is a Python library for defining, simulating, and calibrating Markov state-transition models. Stochastic models are often computationally intensive, making them impractical to use in pandemic response efforts despite their favourable interpretations compared to their deterministic counterparts. gemlib decomposes state-transition models into three key ingredients which succinctly encapsulate the model and are sufficient for executing the subsequent computational routines. Simulation is performed using implementations of Gillespie's algorithm for continuous-time models and a generic Tau-leaping algorithm for discrete time models. gemlib models integrate seamlessly with Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers as they provide a target distribution for the inference algorithm. Algorithms are implemented using the machine learning computational frameworks JAX and TensorFlow Probability, thus taking advantage of modern hardware to accelerate computation. This abstracts away computational concerns from modellers, allowing them to focus on developing and testing different model structures or assumptions. The gemlib library enables users to rapidly implement and calibrate stochastic epidemic models with the flexibility and robustness required to support decision during an emerging outbreak.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate Approach for Covariance Matrix Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reichel (2025) defined the Bariance as $\mathrm{Bariance}(x)=\frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i&lt;j}(x_i-x_j)^2$, which admits an $O(n)$ reformulation using scalar sums. We extend this to the covariance matrix by showing that $\mathrm{Cov}(X)=\frac{1}{n-1}\!\left(X^\top X-\frac{1}{n}\,s\,s^\top\right)$ with $s=X^\top \mathbf{1}_n$ is algebraically identical to the pairwise-difference form yet avoids explicit centering. Computation reduces to a single $p\times p$ outer matrix product and one subtraction. Empirical benchmarks in Python show clear runtime gains over numpy.cov in non-BLAS-tuned settings. Faster Gram routines such as RXTX (Rybin et. al) for $XX^\top$ further reduce total cost.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Fitting of Intractable Models via Sequential Sampling and Local Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive algorithm for fitting generative models whose likelihood, moments, and other quantities typically used for inference are not analytically or numerically tractable. The proposed method aims to provide a general solution that requires only limited prior information on the model parameters. The algorithm combines a global search phase, aimed at identifying the region of the solution, with a local search phase that mimics a trust region version of the Fisher scoring algorithm for computing a quasi-likelihood estimator. Comparisons with alternative methods demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed approach. An R package implementing the algorithm is available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>riemtan, riemstats: R packages for Riemannian geometry techniques in the analysis of multiple samples of connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices arising from functional connectivity analysis of neuroimaging data can be endowed with a Riemannian geometric structure that standard methods fail to respect. While existing R packages provide some tools for SPD matrix analysis, they suffer from limitations in scalability, numerical stability, and metric flexibility that hinder their application to modern large-scale connectomics studies. We present riemtan, a comprehensive R package that addresses these challenges through a unified, high-level interface supporting multiple Riemannian metrics, efficient parallel computation, and seamless conversion between manifold, tangent, and vectorized representations. Building on riemtan's foundation, we also introduce riemstats, which implements advanced statistical methods including Fr\'echet ANOVA, Riemannian ANOVA with classic test statistics, and harmonization techniques for multi-site studies. The modular design facilitates integration with existing R workflows and provides an extensible framework for future methodological developments in manifold-valued data analysis.</description>

      <title>Sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Filtering of State-Space Models with Low or Degenerate Observation Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the discrete-time filtering problem in scenarios where the observation noise is degenerate or low. More precisely, one is given access to a discrete time observation sequence which at any time $k$ depends only on the state of an unobserved Markov chain. We specifically assume that the functional relationship between observations and hidden Markov chain has either degenerate or low noise. In this article, under suitable assumptions, we derive the filtering density and its recursions for this class of problems on a specific sequence of manifolds defined through the observation function. We then design sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to approximate the filter serially in time. For a certain linear observation model, we show that using sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo for low noise will converge as the noise disappears to that of using sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo for degenerate noise. We illustrate the performance of our methodology on several challenging stochastic models deriving from Statistics and Applied Mathematics.</description>

      <title>Core-elements Subsampling for Alternating Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel element-wise subset selection method for the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, focusing on low-rank matrix factorization involving matrices with missing values, as commonly encountered in recommender systems. While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS. Extensive simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, emphasizing its potential in large-scale recommendation systems.</description>
