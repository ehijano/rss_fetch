      <title>Breather-to-soliton transitions and nonlinear wave interactions for the higher-order modified Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the intricate dynamics of the breather-to-soliton transitions and nonlinear wave interactions for the higher-order modified Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation. We discuss the transition conditions of the breather-to-soliton and obtain different types of nonlinear converted waves, including the W-shaped soliton, M-shaped soliton, multi-peak soliton, anti-dark soliton and periodic wave solution. Meanwhile, the interactions among the above nonlinear converted waves are explored by choosing appropriate parameters. Furthermore, we derive the double-pole breather-to-soliton transitions and apply the asymptotic analysis method to analyze the dynamics of the asymptotic solitons for the double-pole anti-dark soliton.</description>

      <title>Computing Multi-Lumps in Nonlinearity-Managed Spatial-Symmetric Dispersive Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multi-lump waves in a generalized spatial symmetric higher-dimensional dispersive water wave model using an analytical approach. This involves the construction of explicit solutions using Hirota's bilinear method and generalized polynomial expansions. The dynamical study shows that the multi-lump waves are non-interacting and reveal different geometrical patterns.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal thermalization and adiabatic cooling of guided light waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically characterize three-dimensional spatio-temporal thermalization of a continuous-wave classical light beam propagating along a multi-mode optical waveguide. By combining a non-equilibrium kinetic approach based on the wave turbulence theory and numerical simulations of the field equations, we anticipate that thermalizing scattering events are dramatically accelerated by the combination of strong transverse confinement with the continuous nature of the temporal degrees of freedom. In connection with the blackbody catastrophe, the thermalization of the classical field in the continuous temporal direction provides an intrinsic mechanism for adiabatic cooling and, then, spatial beam condensation. Our results open new avenues in the direction of a simultaneous spatial and temporal beam cleaning.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modes of active Potts models with factorizable numbers of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the long-term nonequilibrium dynamics of q-state Potts models with q = 4, 5, 6, and 8 using Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional square lattice. When the contact energies between the nearest neighbors for the standard Potts models are used, cyclic changes in the q homogeneous phases and q-state coexisting wave mode appear at low and high flipping energies, respectively, for all values of q. However, for a factorizable q value, dynamic modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For q = 6, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values.</description>

      <title>Properties of Non-topological Solitons in Two-dimensional Model With Resurrected Conformal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of non-topological solitons in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The spectrum of linear perturbations on these solutions is found to be trivial, containing only symmetry-related zero modes. The interpretation of this feature is given by considering the relativistic generalization of our theory in which the conformal symmetry is violated. It is explicitly seen that the restoration of this symmetry leads to the absence of decay/vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave solutions, periodic and superposition solutions to the system of first-order (2+1)-dimensional Boussinesq's equations derived from the Euler equations for an ideal fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concludes the study of (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear wave equations that can be derived in a model of an ideal fluid with irrotational motion. In the considered case of identical scaling of the $x,y$ variables, obtaining a (2+1)-dimensional wave equation analogous to the KdV equation is impossible. Instead, from a system of two first-order Boussinesq equations, a non-linear wave equation for the auxiliary function $f(x,y,z)$ defining the velocity potential can be obtained, and only from its solutions can the surface wave form $\eta(x,y,t)$ be obtained. We demonstrate the existence of families of (2+1)-dimensional traveling wave solutions, including solitary and periodic solutions, of both cnoidal and superposition types.</description>

      <title>Engineering spectro-temporal light states with physics-embedded deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra, supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise. Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-embedded convolutional neural network (P-CNN) that embeds spectro-temporal correlations can circumvent such challenges, resulting in faster convergence and reduced noise sensitivity. This innovative approach enables on-demand control over spectro-temporal features of SC, achieving few-cycle pulse shaping without external compressors. This approach heralds a new era of arbitrary spectro-temporal light state engineering, with implications for ultrafast photonics, photonic neuromorphic computation, and AI-driven optical systems.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>
