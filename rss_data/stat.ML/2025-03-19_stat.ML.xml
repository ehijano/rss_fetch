      <title>Variational Autoencoded Multivariate Spatial Fay-Herriot Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small area estimation models are essential for estimating population characteristics in regions with limited sample sizes, thereby supporting policy decisions, demographic studies, and resource allocation, among other use cases. The spatial Fay-Herriot model is one such approach that incorporates spatial dependence to improve estimation by borrowing strength from neighboring regions. However, this approach often requires substantial computational resources, limiting its scalability for high-dimensional datasets, especially when considering multiple (multivariate) responses. This paper proposes two methods that integrate the multivariate spatial Fay-Herriot model with spatial random effects, learned through variational autoencoders, to efficiently leverage spatial structure. Importantly, after training the variational autoencoder to represent spatial dependence for a given set of geographies, it may be used again in future modeling efforts, without the need for retraining. Additionally, the use of the variational autoencoder to represent spatial dependence results in extreme improvements in computational efficiency, even for massive datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using 5-year period estimates from the American Community Survey over all census tracts in California.</description>

      <title>The Hardness of Validating Observational Studies with Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational data is often readily available in large quantities, but can lead to biased causal effect estimates due to the presence of unobserved confounding. Recent works attempt to remove this bias by supplementing observational data with experimental data, which, when available, is typically on a smaller scale due to the time and cost involved in running a randomised controlled trial. In this work, we prove a theorem that places fundamental limits on this ``best of both worlds'' approach. Using the framework of impossible inference, we show that although it is possible to use experimental data to \emph{falsify} causal effect estimates from observational data, in general it is not possible to \emph{validate} such estimates. Our theorem proves that while experimental data can be used to detect bias in observational studies, without additional assumptions on the smoothness of the correction function, it can not be used to remove it. We provide a practical example of such an assumption, developing a novel Gaussian Process based approach to construct intervals which contain the true treatment effect with high probability, both inside and outside of the support of the experimental data. We demonstrate our methodology on both simulated and semi-synthetic datasets and make the \href{https://github.com/Jakefawkes/Obs_and_exp_data}{code available}.</description>

      <title>Interpretability of Graph Neural Networks to Assert Effects of Global Change Drivers on Ecological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pollinators play a crucial role for plant reproduction, either in natural ecosystem or in human-modified landscape. Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assert the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. A large simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Bayesian Update via Ensemble Kernel Regression with Clustering and Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Bayesian update for a prior ensemble is proposed to extend traditional ensemble Kalman filtering to settings characterized by non-Gaussian priors and nonlinear measurement operators. In this framework, the observed component is first denoised via a standard Kalman update, while the unobserved component is estimated using a nonlinear regression approach based on kernel density estimation. The method incorporates a subsampling strategy to ensure stability and, when necessary, employs unsupervised clustering to refine the conditional estimate. Numerical experiments on Lorenz systems and a PDE-constrained inverse problem illustrate that the proposed nonlinear update can reduce estimation errors compared to standard linear updates, especially in highly nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Online federated learning framework for classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel online federated learning framework for classification, designed to handle streaming data from multiple clients while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. Our method leverages the generalized distance-weighted discriminant technique, making it robust to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions across clients. In particular, we develop a new optimization algorithm based on the Majorization-Minimization principle, integrated with a renewable estimation procedure, enabling efficient model updates without full retraining. We provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of our estimator, proving its consistency and asymptotic normality under standard regularity conditions. In addition, we establish that our method achieves Bayesian risk consistency, ensuring its reliability for classification tasks in federated environments. We further incorporate differential privacy mechanisms to enhance data security, protecting client information while maintaining model performance. Extensive numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach delivers high classification accuracy, significant computational efficiency gains, and substantial savings in data storage requirements compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Nonlinear Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised representation learning in slightly misspecified settings, and thus formalize the study of robustness of nonlinear representation learning. We focus on the case where the mixing is close to a local isometry in a suitable distance and show based on existing rigidity results that the mixing can be identified up to linear transformations and small errors. In a second step, we investigate Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with observations generated according to $x=f(s)=As+h(s)$ where $A$ is an invertible mixing matrix and $h$ a small perturbation. We show that we can approximately recover the matrix $A$ and the independent components. Together, these two results show approximate identifiability of nonlinear ICA with almost isometric mixing functions. Those results are a step towards identifiability results for unsupervised representation learning for real-world data that do not follow restrictive model classes.</description>

      <title>Machine learning algorithms to predict stroke in China based on causal inference of time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participants: This study employed a combination of Vector Autoregression (VAR) model and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to systematically construct dynamic causal inference. Multiple classic classification algorithms were compared, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting, and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). The SMOTE algorithm was used to undersample a small number of samples and employed Stratified K-fold Cross Validation. Results: This study included a total of 11,789 participants, including 6,334 females (53.73%) and 5,455 males (46.27%), with an average age of 65 years. Introduction of dynamic causal inference features has significantly improved the performance of almost all models. The area under the ROC curve of each model ranged from 0.78 to 0.83, indicating significant difference (P &lt; 0.01). Among all the models, the Gradient Boosting model demonstrated the highest performance and stability. Model explanation and feature importance analysis generated model interpretation that illustrated significant contributors associated with risks of stroke. Conclusions and Relevance: This study proposes a stroke risk prediction method that combines dynamic causal inference with machine learning models, significantly improving prediction accuracy and revealing key health factors that affect stroke. The research results indicate that dynamic causal inference features have important value in predicting stroke risk, especially in capturing the impact of changes in health status over time on stroke risk. By further optimizing the model and introducing more variables, this study provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for future stroke prevention and intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Spline refinement with differentiable rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting slender, overlapping structures remains a challenge in computational microscopy. While recent coordinate-based approaches improve detection, they often produce less accurate splines than pixel-based methods. We introduce a training-free differentiable rendering approach to spline refinement, achieving both high reliability and sub-pixel accuracy. Our method improves spline quality, enhances robustness to distribution shifts, and shrinks the gap between synthetic and real-world data. Being fully unsupervised, the method is a drop-in replacement for the popular active contour model for spline refinement. Evaluated on C. elegans nematodes, a popular model organism for drug discovery and biomedical research, we demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both coordinate- and pixel-based methods.</description>

      <title>Sampling Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</description>

      <title>On the Precise Asymptotics of Universal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistical inference, confidence set procedures are typically evaluated based on their validity and width properties. Even when procedures achieve rate-optimal widths, confidence sets can still be excessively wide in practice due to elusive constants, leading to extreme conservativeness, where the empirical coverage probability of nominal $1-\alpha$ level confidence sets approaches one. This manuscript studies this gap between validity and conservativeness, using universal inference (Wasserman et al., 2020) with a regular parametric model under model misspecification as a running example. We identify the source of asymptotic conservativeness and propose a general remedy based on studentization and bias correction. The resulting method attains exact asymptotic coverage at the nominal $1-\alpha$ level, even under model misspecification, provided that the product of the estimation errors of two unknowns is negligible, exhibiting an intriguing resemblance to double robustness in semiparametric theory.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. While this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a Bayesian non-parametric approach to signal separation where the signals may vary according to latent variables. Our key contribution is to augment Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) for the case where each data point comprises the weighted sum of a known number of pure component signals, observed across several input locations. Our framework allows arbitrary non-linear variations in the signals while being able to incorporate useful priors for the linear weights, such as summing-to-one. Our contributions are particularly relevant to spectroscopy, where changing conditions may cause the underlying pure component signals to vary from sample to sample. To demonstrate the applicability to both spectroscopy and other domains, we consider several applications: a near-infrared spectroscopy dataset with varying temperatures, a simulated dataset for identifying flow configuration through a pipe, and a dataset for determining the type of rock from its reflectance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need for regression models to predict circular values arises in many scientific fields. In this work we explore a family of expressive and interpretable distributions over circle-valued random functions related to Gaussian processes targeting two Euclidean dimensions conditioned on the unit circle. The probability model has connections with continuous spin models in statistical physics. Moreover, its density is very simple and has maximum-entropy, unlike previous Gaussian process-based approaches, which use wrapping or radial marginalization. For posterior inference, we introduce a new Stratonovich-like augmentation that lends itself to fast Gibbs sampling. We argue that transductive learning in these models favors a Bayesian approach to the parameters and apply our sampling scheme to the Double Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We present experiments applying this model to the prediction of (i) wind directions and (ii) the percentage of the running gait cycle as a function of joint angles.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of Mirror Flow for Shallow Neural Networks in Univariate Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the implicit bias of mirror flow in univariate least squares error regression with wide and shallow neural networks. For a broad class of potential functions, we show that mirror flow exhibits lazy training and has the same implicit bias as ordinary gradient flow when the network width tends to infinity. For ReLU networks, we characterize this bias through a variational problem in function space. Our analysis includes prior results for ordinary gradient flow as a special case and lifts limitations which required either an intractable adjustment of the training data or networks with skip connections. We further introduce scaled potentials and show that for these, mirror flow still exhibits lazy training but is not in the kernel regime. For networks with absolute value activations, we show that mirror flow with scaled potentials induces a rich class of biases, which generally cannot be captured by an RKHS norm. A takeaway is that whereas the parameter initialization determines how strongly the curvature of the learned function is penalized at different locations of the input space, the scaled potential determines how the different magnitudes of the curvature are penalized.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization Algorithms for Linear Adversarial Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial training can be used to learn models that are robust against perturbations. For linear models, it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. Compared to methods proposed in the context of deep learning, leveraging the optimization structure allows significantly faster convergence rates. Still, the use of generic convex solvers can be inefficient for large-scale problems. Here, we propose tailored optimization algorithms for the adversarial training of linear models, which render large-scale regression and classification problems more tractable. For regression problems, we propose a family of solvers based on iterative ridge regression and, for classification, a family of solvers based on projected gradient descent. The methods are based on extended variable reformulations of the original problem. We illustrate their efficiency in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Crawling Algorithm Utilizing Noisy Change-Indicating Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web refresh crawling is the problem of keeping a cache of web pages fresh, that is, having the most recent copy available when a page is requested, given a limited bandwidth available to the crawler. Under the assumption that the change and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson processes, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In this paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information indicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example, signals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available. Incorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging, because (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with missing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance over web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might differ from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm which (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild assumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii) is able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total bandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new optimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized computation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach.</description>

      <title>A sharp uniform-in-time error estimate for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a sharp uniform-in-time error estimate for the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), which is a widely-used sampling algorithm. Under mild assumptions, we obtain a uniform-in-time $O(\eta^2)$ bound for the KL-divergence between the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, where $\eta$ is the step size (or learning rate). Our analysis is also valid for varying step sizes. Consequently, we are able to derive an $O(\eta)$ bound for the distance between the invariant measures of the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, in terms of Wasserstein or total variation distances. Our result can be viewed as a significant improvement compared with existing analysis for SGLD in related literature.</description>

      <title>Artificial Replay: A Meta-Algorithm for Harnessing Historical Data in Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most real-world deployments of bandit algorithms exist somewhere in between the offline and online set-up, where some historical data is available upfront and additional data is collected dynamically online. How best to incorporate historical data to "warm start" bandit algorithms is an open question: naively initializing reward estimates using all historical samples can suffer from spurious data and imbalanced data coverage, leading to data inefficiency (amount of historical data used) - particularly for continuous action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose ArtificialReplay, a meta-algorithm for incorporating historical data into any arbitrary base bandit algorithm. We show that ArtificialReplay uses only a fraction of the historical data compared to a full warm-start approach, while still achieving identical regret for base algorithms that satisfy independence of irrelevant data (IIData), a novel and broadly applicable property that we introduce. We complement these theoretical results with experiments on K-armed bandits and continuous combinatorial bandits, on which we model green security domains using real poaching data. Our results show the practical benefits of ArtificialReplay for improving data efficiency, including for base algorithms that do not satisfy IIData.</description>

      <title>Auto-Encoding Goodness of Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new type of generative autoencoder called the Goodness-of-Fit Autoencoder (GoFAE), which incorporates GoF tests at two levels. At the minibatch level, it uses GoF test statistics as regularization objectives. At a more global level, it selects a regularization coefficient based on higher criticism, i.e., a test on the uniformity of the local GoF p-values. We justify the use of GoF tests by providing a relaxed $L_2$-Wasserstein bound on the distance between the latent distribution and a distribution class. We prove that optimization based on these tests can be done with stochastic gradient descent on a compact Riemannian manifold. Empirically, we show that our higher criticism parameter selection procedure balances reconstruction and generation using mutual information and uniformity of p-values respectively. Finally, we show that GoFAE achieves comparable FID scores and mean squared errors with competing deep generative models while retaining statistical indistinguishability from Gaussian in the latent space based on a variety of hypothesis tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandits are one of the theoretical pillars of reinforcement learning. Recently, the investigation of quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandit problems was started, and it was found that a quadratic speed-up (in query complexity) is possible when the arms and the randomness of the rewards of the arms can be queried in superposition. Here we introduce further bandit models where we only have limited access to the randomness of the rewards, but we can still query the arms in superposition. We show that then the query complexity is the same as for classical algorithms. This generalizes the prior result that no speed-up is possible for unstructured search when the oracle has positive failure probability.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Mixup to Data for Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among all data augmentation techniques proposed so far, linear interpolation of training samples, also called Mixup, has found to be effective for a large panel of applications. Along with improved predictive performance, Mixup is also a good technique for improving calibration. However, mixing data carelessly can lead to manifold mismatch, i.e., synthetic data lying outside original class manifolds, which can deteriorate calibration. In this work, we show that the likelihood of assigning a wrong label with mixup increases with the distance between data to mix. To this end, we propose to dynamically change the underlying distributions of interpolation coefficients depending on the similarity between samples to mix, and define a flexible framework to do so without losing in diversity. We provide extensive experiments for classification and regression tasks, showing that our proposed method improves predictive performance and calibration of models, while being much more efficient.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Active Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based feedback is important for many applications in machine learning where evaluation of a reward function is not feasible. Notable recent examples arise in preference alignment for large language models, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). For many applications of preference alignment, the cost of acquiring human feedback can be substantial. In this work, we take advantage of the fact that one can often choose contexts at which to obtain human feedback to most efficiently identify a good policy, and formalize the setting as an active contextual dueling bandit problem. We propose an active exploration algorithm to efficiently select the data and provide theoretical proof that it has a polynomial worst-case regret bound. We extend the setting and methodology for practical use in preference alignment of large language models. We provide two extensions, an online and an offline approach. Our method outperforms the baselines with limited samples of human preferences on several language models and four real-world datasets including two new datasets that we contribute to the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial example (AE) is an attack method for machine learning, which is crafted by adding imperceptible perturbation to the data inducing misclassification. In the current paper, we investigated the upper bound of the probability of successful AEs based on the Gaussian Process (GP) classification, a probabilistic inference model. We proved a new upper bound of the probability of a successful AE attack that depends on AE's perturbation norm, the kernel function used in GP, and the distance of the closest pair with different labels in the training dataset. Surprisingly, the upper bound is determined regardless of the distribution of the sample dataset. We showed that our theoretical result was confirmed through the experiment using ImageNet. In addition, we showed that changing the parameters of the kernel function induces a change of the upper bound of the probability of successful AEs.</description>

      <title>Statistical ranking with dynamic covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general covariate-assisted statistical ranking model within the Plackett--Luce framework. Unlike previous studies focusing on individual effects with fixed covariates, our model allows covariates to vary across comparisons. This added flexibility enhances model fitting yet brings significant challenges in analysis. This paper addresses these challenges in the context of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We first provide sufficient and necessary conditions for both model identifiability and the unique existence of the MLE. Then, we develop an efficient alternating maximization algorithm to compute the MLE. Under suitable assumptions on the design of comparison graphs and covariates, we establish a uniform consistency result for the MLE, with convergence rates determined by the asymptotic graph connectivity. We also construct random designs where the proposed assumptions hold almost surely. Numerical studies are conducted to support our findings and demonstrate the model's application to real-world datasets, including horse racing and tennis competitions.</description>

      <title>LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</description>

      <title>A Convex Relaxation Approach to Generalization Analysis for Parallel Positively Homogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for deriving generalization bounds for parallel positively homogeneous neural networks--a class of neural networks whose input-output map decomposes as the sum of positively homogeneous maps. Examples of such networks include matrix factorization and sensing, single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, tensor factorization, deep linear and ReLU networks, and more. Our general framework is based on linking the non-convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to a closely related convex optimization problem over prediction functions, which provides a global, achievable lower-bound to the ERM problem. We exploit this convex lower-bound to perform generalization analysis in the convex space while controlling the discrepancy between the convex model and its non-convex counterpart. We apply our general framework to a wide variety of models ranging from low-rank matrix sensing, to structured matrix sensing, two-layer linear networks, two-layer ReLU networks, and single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, achieving generalization bounds with a sample complexity that scales almost linearly with the network width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose reinterpreting copula density estimation as a discriminative task. Under this novel estimation scheme, we train a classifier to distinguish samples from the joint density from those of the product of independent marginals, recovering the copula density in the process. We derive equivalences between well-known copula classes and classification problems naturally arising in our interpretation. Furthermore, we show our estimator achieves theoretical guarantees akin to maximum likelihood estimation. By identifying a connection with density ratio estimation, we benefit from the rich literature and models available for such problems. Empirically, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach by estimating copulas of real and high-dimensional datasets, outperforming competing copula estimators in density evaluation as well as sampling.</description>

      <title>Comparing Targeting Strategies for Maximizing Social Welfare with Limited Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used to select which individuals receive limited-resource interventions in domains such as human services, education, development, and more. However, it is often not apparent what the right quantity is for models to predict. Policymakers rarely have access to data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that would enable accurate estimates of which individuals would benefit more from the intervention, while observational data creates a substantial risk of bias in treatment effect estimates. Practitioners instead commonly use a technique termed ``risk-based targeting" where the model is just used to predict each individual's status quo outcome (an easier, non-causal task). Those with higher predicted risk are offered treatment. There is currently almost no empirical evidence to inform which choices lead to the most effective machine learning-informed targeting strategies in social domains. In this work, we use data from 5 real-world RCTs in a variety of domains to empirically assess such choices. We find that when treatment effects can be estimated with high accuracy (which we simulate by allowing the model to partially observe outcomes in advance), treatment effect based targeting substantially outperforms risk-based targeting, even when treatment effect estimates are biased. Moreover, these results hold even when the policymaker has strong normative preferences for assisting higher-risk individuals. However, the features and data actually available in most RCTs we examine do not suffice for accurate estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects. Our results suggest treatment effect targeting has significant potential benefits, but realizing these benefits requires improvements to data collection and model training beyond what is currently common in practice.</description>

      <title>Hard constraint learning approaches with trainable influence functions for evolutionary equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel deep learning approach for solving evolutionary equations, which integrates sequential learning strategies with an enhanced hard constraint strategy featuring trainable parameters, addressing the low computational accuracy of standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in large temporal domains.Sequential learning strategies divide a large temporal domain into multiple subintervals and solve them one by one in a chronological order, which naturally respects the principle of causality and improves the stability of the PINN solution. The improved hard constraint strategy strictly ensures the continuity and smoothness of the PINN solution at time interval nodes, and at the same time passes the information from the previous interval to the next interval, which avoids the incorrect/trivial solution at the position far from the initial time. Furthermore, by investigating the requirements of different types of equations on hard constraints, we design a novel influence function with trainable parameters for hard constraints, which provides theoretical and technical support for the effective implementations of hard constraint strategies, and significantly improves the universality and computational accuracy of our method. In addition, an adaptive time-domain partitioning algorithm is proposed, which plays an important role in the application of the proposed method as well as in the improvement of computational efficiency and accuracy. Numerical experiments verify the performance of the method. The data and code accompanying this paper are available at https://github.com/zhizhi4452/HCS.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics are stable (i.e. contracting exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless they produce highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</description>
