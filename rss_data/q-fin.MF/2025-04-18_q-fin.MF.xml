      <title>Optimal Capital Structure for Life Insurance Companies Offering Surplus Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt Leland's dynamic capital structure model to the context of an insurance company selling participating life insurance contracts explaining the existence of life insurance contracts which provide both a guaranteed payment and surplus participation to the policyholders. Our derivation of the optimal participation rate reveals its pronounced sensitivity to the contract duration and the associated tax rate. Moreover, the asset substitution effect, which describes the tendency of equity holders to increase the riskiness of a company's investment decisions, decreases when adding surplus participation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification and invariant solutions of the classical geometric mean reversion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Lie symmetry method, we investigate a Feynman-Kac formula for the classical geometric mean reversion process, which effectively describing the dynamics of short-term interest rates. The Lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries and the corresponding one-parameter symmetry groups of the equation are obtained. An optimal system of invariant solutions are constructed by a derived optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Because of taking into account a supply response to price rises, this equation provides for a more realistic assumption than the geometric Brownian motion in many investment scenarios.</description>

      <title>A model of strategic sustainable investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a problem of optimal irreversible investment and emission reduction formulated as a nonzero-sum dynamic game between an investor with environmental preferences and a firm. The game is set in continuous time on an infinite-time horizon. The firm generates profits with a stochastic dynamics and may spend part of its revenues towards emission reduction (e.g., renovating the infrastructure). The firm's objective is to maximize the discounted expectation of a function of its profits. The investor participates in the profits, may decide to invest to support the firm's production capacity and uses a profit function which accounts for both financial and environmental factors. Nash equilibria of the game are obtained via a system of variational inequalities. We formulate a general verification theorem for this system in a diffusive setup and construct an explicit solution in the zero-noise limit. Our explicit results and numerical approximations show that both the investor's and the firm's optimal actions are triggered by moving boundaries that increase with the total amount of emission abatement.</description>
