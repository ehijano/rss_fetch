      <title>Effective Disjunction and Effective Interpolation in Suffciently Strong Proof Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we deal with the uniform effective disjunction property and the uniform effective interpolation property, which are weaker versions of the classical effective disjunction property and the effective interpolation property.\\ The main result of the paper is as follows: Suppose the proof system $EF$ (Extended Frege) has the uniform effective disjunction property, then every sufficiently strong proof system $S$ that corresponds to a theory $T$, which is a theory in the same language as the theory $V_{1}^{1}$, also has the uniform effective disjunction property. Furthermore, if we assume that $EF$ has the uniform effective interpolation property, then the proof system $S$ also has the uniform effective interpolation property.\\ From this, it easily follows that if $EF$ has the uniform effective interpolation property, then for every disjoint $NE$-pair, there exists a set in $E$ that separates this pair. Thus, if $EF$ has the uniform effective interpolation property, it specifically holds that $NE \cap coNE = E$.
  Additionally, at the end of the article, the following is proven: Suppose the proof system $EF$ has the uniform effective interpolation property, and let $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ be a (not necessarily disjoint) NE-pair such that $A_{1} \cup A_{2} = \mathbb{N}$; then there exists an exponential time algorithm which for every input $n$ (of length $O(\log n)$) finds $i\in\{1,2\}$ such that $n\in A_{i}$.</description>

      <title>Consistency of square bracket partition relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic earlier results were of the form CON$(2^{\aleph_0} \to [\lambda]^2_{n, 2})$, with $2^{\aleph_0} $ an ex-large cardinal, in the best case the first weakly Mahlo cardinal. Characteristic new results are CON$((2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_m) + \aleph_l \to [\aleph_k]^2_{n, 2})$, for suitable $k &lt; l &lt; m$. So we improve in three respects: the continuum may be small (e.g. not a weakly Mahlo), we use no large cardinal, and the cardinals $\lambda$ involved are $ &lt; 2^{\aleph_0}$ after the forcing.</description>

      <title>Vaught's Conjecture and Theories of Partial Order Admitting a Finite Lexicographic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete theory ${\mathcal T}$ of partial order is an FLD$_1$-theory iff some (equivalently, any) of its models ${\mathbb X}$ admits a finite lexicographic decomposition ${\mathbb X} =\sum _{{\mathbb I}}{\mathbb X} _i$, where ${\mathbb I}$ is a finite partial order and ${\mathbb X} _i$-s are partial orders with a largest element. Then we write $\sum _{{\mathbb I}}{\mathbb X}_i\in {\mathcal D} ({\mathcal T})$ and call $\sum _{{\mathbb I}}{\mathbb X}_i$ a VC-decomposition (resp. a VC$^\sharp$-decomposition} iff ${\mathbb X} _i$ satisfies Vaught's conjecture (VC) (resp. VC$^\sharp$: $I({\mathbb X} _i)\in \{ 1,{\mathfrak{c}}\}$), for each $i\in I$. ${\mathcal T}$ is called actually Vaught's iff for some $\sum _{{\mathbb I}}{\mathbb X}_i\in {\mathcal D} ({\mathcal T})$ there are sentences $\tau _i\in \mathop{\rm Th}\nolimits ({\mathbb X} _i)$, $i\in I$, providing VC. We prove that: (1) VC is true for ${\mathcal T}$ iff ${\mathcal T}$ is large or its atomic model has a VC decomposition; (2) VC is true for each actually Vaught's FLD$_1$ theory; (3) VC$^\sharp$ is true for ${\mathcal T}$, if there is a VC$^\sharp$-decomposition of a model of ${\mathcal T}$. VC is true for the partial orders from the closure $\langle {\mathcal C} ^{\rm reticle}_0\cup {\mathcal C} ^{\rm ba}\rangle _{\Sigma}$, where $\langle {\mathcal C}\rangle _{\Sigma}$ denotes the closure of a class ${\mathcal C}$ under finite lexicographic sums. VC$^{\sharp}$ is true for a large class of partial orders of the form $\sum _{{\mathbb I}}(\dot{\bigcup}_{j&lt;n_i}\prod _{k&lt;m_i^j}{\mathbb X} _i^{j,k})_r$, where ${\mathbb X} _i^{j,k}$-s can be linear orders, or Boolean algebras, or belong to a wide class of trees.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic randomness in harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the last fifteen years, a program of establishing relationships between algorithmic randomness and almost-everywhere theorems in analysis and ergodic theory has developed. In harmonic analysis, Franklin, McNicholl, and Rute characterized Schnorr randomness using an effective version of Carleson's Theorem. We show here that, for computable $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, the reals at which the Fourier series of a weakly computable vector in $L^p[-\pi,\pi]$ converges are precisely the Martin-L\"{o}f random reals. Furthermore, we show that radial limits of the Poisson integral of an $L^1(\mathbb{R})$-computable function coincide with the values of the function at exactly the Schnorr random reals and that radial limits of the Poisson integral of a weakly $L^1(\mathbb{R})$-computable function coincide with the values of the function at exactly the Martin-L\"{o}f random reals.</description>

      <title>Approximability of deep equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a structural framework for computations involving floating-point operations.Informed by real-valued logic, we introduce deep computations (ultracomputations) and deep iterates, formalizing the ideas of "asymptotic limit" of computations and compositional iterates, respectively.
  As an application of this framework, we prove the existence of deep equilibria, which hitherto have been found only empirically (yielding remarkable memory savings in deep learning). Our proof of existence of deep equilibria is based on the concept of idempotent ultrafilter from combinatorics and inspired by the notion of indiscernibility from model theory.
  We study and characterize deep computations (and hence deep equilibria) that are bona fide computable, i.e., uniformly approximable by a priori given computable primitive real-valued functions. Informed by model theory of real-valued structures, as well as Cp-theory from topology, we use a classical result of Grothendieck to characterize computability of deep computations in terms of continuous extendibility.
  Our framework does not impose a priori uniform/global bounds on real-valued quantities; therefore, our structures yield non-compact types spaces. Such type spaces require a more nuanced topological treatment than compact ones arising in model theory of [0,1]-valued structures.</description>

Abstract: We give two consistent constructions of trees $T$ whose finite power $T^{n+1}$ is sharply different from $T^n$:
  1. An $\aleph_1$-tree $T$ whose interval topology $X_T$ is perfectly normal, but $(X_T)^2$ is not even countably metacompact.
  2. For an inaccessible $\kappa$ and a positive integer $n$, a $\kappa$-tree such that all of its $n$-derived trees are Souslin and all of its $(n+1)$-derived trees are special.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Iterations with Countable and $&lt;\kappa$-Support: A Framework for Choiceless ZF Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for symmetric iterations with countable and, more generally, $&lt;\kappa$-support. Set-length iterations are handled uniformly, and, when the template is first-order definable over a G\"odel-Bernays set theory with Global Choice ground, the same scheme yields class-length iterations. Limit stages with $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)\ge\kappa$ are treated by direct limits; limits with $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)&lt;\kappa$ are presented as inverse limits via trees of conditions and tuple-stabilizer filters. The induced limit filters are normal and $\kappa$-complete, which ensures closure of hereditarily symmetric names and preservation of ZF; under a $\kappa$-Baire (strategic-closure) hypothesis we obtain $DC_{&lt;\kappa}$, and under a Localization hypothesis we obtain $DC_\kappa$. For countable support we give an $\omega_1$-length construction that adds reals and refutes AC while preserving ZF+DC, and we show that mixed products (e.g., Cohen with Random) fit naturally via stable pushforwards and restrictions. For singular $\kappa$, we prove the case $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)=\omega$ in full using block-partition stabilizers and trees; for arbitrary singular $\kappa$ we introduce game-guided fusion of length $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)$ and a tree-fusion master condition, yielding singular-limit completeness, preservation of $DC_{&lt;\kappa}$, no collapse of $\kappa$, and no new bounded subsets of $\kappa$. The resulting toolkit provides reusable patterns for constructing choiceless inner models that retain targeted fragments of Dependent Choice.</description>

      <title>MSO logic of the real order with the set quantifier ranging over Borel sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated 1969 theorem of Michael Rabin is that the MSO theory of the real order where the monadic quantifier is allowed only to range over the sets of rational numbers, is decidable. In 1975 Saharon Shelah proved that if the monadic quantifier is allowed to range over all subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is undecidable. He conjectured that when we allow the monadic quantifier to range over the Borel subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is decidable. We confirm this conjecture. Namely, the MSO theory of the real order where the set quantifier is allowed to range over the Borel sets, is decidable.</description>

      <title>Iterating PP-packages without Choice: A Cohen symmetric seed and a localization framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Partition Principle $\mathsf{PP}$ asserts that whenever there is a surjection $A\twoheadrightarrow B$, there is an injection $B\hookrightarrow A$. Russell conjectured in 1906 that $\mathsf{PP}$ is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice $\mathsf{AC}$; while $\mathsf{AC}\Rightarrow \mathsf{PP}$ is immediate, the converse has remained open. We show that $\mathsf{PP}$ does not imply $\mathsf{AC}$ by constructing a transitive model of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$.
  Starting from a Cohen symmetric model $\mathcal{N}$ of $\mathrm{Add}(\omega,\omega_1)$ built with a countable-support symmetry filter, we fix parameters $S:=A^\omega$ and $T:=\mathcal{P}(S)$ and perform a class-length countable-support symmetric iteration. At successor stages we use orbit-symmetrized packages that split targeted surjections, yielding $\mathsf{PP}\!\restriction T$ and $\mathsf{AC}_{\mathsf{WO}}$, while preserving $\mathsf{DC}$ and ensuring that $A$ remains non-well-orderable. A diagonal-cancellation/diagonal-lift infrastructure supplies a proper $\omega_1$-complete normal filter at limit stages. Finally, Ryan--Smith localization shows that under $\mathsf{SVC}^+(T)$, $\mathsf{PP}$ is equivalent to $\mathsf{PP}\!\restriction T \wedge \mathsf{AC}_{\mathsf{WO}}$, so the final model satisfies $\mathsf{PP}$ but not $\mathsf{AC}$.</description>

      <title>Hanf numbers for poset games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two well partial orders $(P;\leq_P)$ and $(T;\leq_T)$, each with a minimum element, we study the following question: which player has a winning strategy for Chomp on the poset $(P\times T;\leq_{P\times T})$? Here, $(P\times T;\leq_{P\times T})$ denotes the poset obtained as the Cartesian product of $P$ and $T$, equipped with the corresponding lexicographic order. The answer to this very natural question depends strongly on the specific choice of $(P;\leq_P)$ and $(T;\leq_T)$. For this reason, we restrict our attention to classes of posets given by powers of a fixed poset: $\{(P^\sigma;\leq_{P^\sigma})\mid \sigma\in\mathrm{Ord}\}$. A fundamental fact about these classes of structures is that, if the second player does not have a winning strategy for all the posets in $\{(P^\sigma;\leq_{P^\sigma})\mid \sigma\in\mathrm{Ord}\}$, there exists an ordinal $\xi$ such that the second player has a winning strategy on $(P^{\xi};\leq_{P^{\xi}})$ but not on $(P^{\gamma};\leq_{P^{\gamma}})$ for all $\gamma\geq\xi+1$. Determining the corresponding ordinal for this Hanf number-style property constitutes the main objective of this work.
  Inspired by results of Garc\'ia-Marco and Knauer, we focus on classes of posets with a purely algebraic definition. These posets arise from submonoids (with respect to the natural sum, or Hessenberg sum) of ordinals of the form $\omega^\sigma$ and are generated by sets of ordinals. In the process, we provide a test to determine whether a finite set $\Gamma$ of ordinals indeed yields well partial orders, and, using set-theoretic techniques, we establish an upper bound for the ordinal $\xi$: if $\Gamma\subset\omega$, then $\xi&lt;\omega_1$, and otherwise $\xi&lt;|\bigcup\Gamma|^+$.</description>

      <title>Cut-free Deductive System for Continuous Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop propositional continuous intuitionistic logic and propositional continuous affine logic via complete algebraic semantics. Our approach centres on AC-algebras, which are algebras $USC(\mathcal{L})$ of sup-preserving functions from $[0,1]$ to an integral commutative residuated complete lattice $\mathcal{L}$ (in the intuitionistic case, $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale). We give an algebraic axiomatisation of AC-algebras in the language of continuous logic and prove, using the Macneille completion, that every Archimedean model embeds into some AC-algebra. We also show that (i) $USC(\mathcal{L})$ satisfies $v \dot + v = 2v$ exactly when $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale, (ii) involutiveness of negation in $USC(\mathcal{L})$ corresponds to that in $\mathcal{L} $, and that (iii) adding those conditions recovers classical continuous logic. For each variant -affine, intuitionistic, involutive, classical -we provide a sequent style deductive system and prove completeness and cut admissibility. This yields the first sequent style formulation of classical continuous logic enjoying cut admissibility.</description>
