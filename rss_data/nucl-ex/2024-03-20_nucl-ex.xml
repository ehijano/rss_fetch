      <title>Mixed Species Charge and Baryon Balance Functions Studies with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed species charge and baryon balance functions are computed based on proton--proton (pp) collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8 model. Simulations are performed with selected values of the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the Monash tune and the Ropes and Shoving modes of PYTHIA8 to explore whether such measurements provide useful new information and constraints on mechanisms of particle production in pp collisions. Charge balance functions are studied based on mixed pairs of pions, kaons, and protons, whereas baryon balance functions are computed for mixed low mass strange and non-strange baryons. Both charge and baryon balance functions of mixed particle pairs feature shapes and amplitudes that sensitively depend on the particle considered owing largely to the particle production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA. The evolution of balance functions integrals with the longitudinal width of the acceptance are presented and one finds that sums of such integrals for a given reference particle obey expected sum rules for both charge and baryon balance functions. Additionally, both types of balance functions are found to evolve in shape and amplitude with increasing collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the PYTHIA tunes considered.</description>

      <title>Design, construction, and operation of a 1-ton Water-based Liquid scintillator detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water-based liquid scintillators (WbLS) are attractive neutrino detector materials because they allow us to tune the ratio of the Cherenkov and scintillation signals. Using WbLS large-scale neutrino experiments can benefit from both directional reconstruction and enhanced low-energy efficiency. Furthermore, broadening the science capability of such materials by metal doping may be better suited for water based liquid scintillators. We recently constructed and commissioned a 1-ton WbLS detector with good photosensor coverage and a capable data acquisition system. We intend to use this flexible detector system as a testbed for WbLS R&amp;D. In this paper we give an overview of the 1-ton system and provide some early analysis results.</description>

      <title>Beam test of n-type Silicon pad array detector at PS CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports the testing of a Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) prototype based on an n-type Si pad array detector at the CERN PS accelerator. The FoCal is a proposed upgrade in the ALICE detector operating within the pseudorapidity range of 3.2 &lt; $\mathrm{\eta}$ &lt; 5.8. It aims to measure direct photons, neutral hadrons, vector mesons, and jets for the study of gluon saturation effects in the unexplored region of low momentum fraction x ($\mathrm{\sim10^{-5} - 10^{-6}}$). The prototype is a $\mathrm{8\times9}$ n-type Si pad array detector with each pad occupying one cm$^2$ area, fabricated on a 6-in, 325~$\mathrm{\pm 10 \thinspace \mu}$m thick, and high-resistivity ($\sim$7 k$\Omega \thinspace$ cm) Si wafer which is readout using HGCROCv2 chip. The detector is tested using pion beams of energy 10~GeV and electron beams of energy 1-5~GeV. The measurements of the Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) response of pions and the shower profiles of electrons are reported.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies, beyond doubt, that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Opportunities at the Sanford Underground Research Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) has been operating for more than 15 years as an international facility dedicated to advancing compelling multidisciplinary underground scientific research in rare-process physics, as well as offering research opportunities in other disciplines. SURF laboratory facilities include a Surface Campus as well as campuses at the 4850-foot level (1490 m, 4300 m.w.e.) that host a range of significant physics experiments, including the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment. The CASPAR nuclear astrophysics accelerator completed the first phase of operation and is planning for the second phase beginning in 2024. SURF is also home to the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) that will host the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SURF offers world-class service, including an ultralow background environment, low-background assay capabilities, and electroformed copper is produced at the facility. SURF is preparing to increase underground laboratory space. Plans are advancing for construction of new large caverns (nominally 100m L x 20m W x 24m H) on the 4850L (1485 m, 4100 m.w.e.) on the timeframe of next generation experiments (~2030). SURF plans to leverage existing advisory and community committees as well as engage the underground science community to inform plans for future laboratory space.</description>

      <title>Theory of non-linear diffusion with a physical gapped mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a system with one conserved charge the charge diffusion is modified by non-linear self-interactions within an effective field theory (EFT) of diffusive fluctuations. We include the slowest ultraviolet (UV) mode, constructing a UV-regulated EFT. The relaxation time of this UV mode is protected from renormalization, as supported by experimental data in a bad metal system. Furthermore, the retarded density-density Green's function acquires four branch points, eventually increasing the range of applicability. We discuss the fate of long-time-tails as well as implications for the quark gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Shell-model study for allowed and forbidden $\beta^-$ decay properties in the "south" region of $^{208}$Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale shell-model calculations have been performed for the neutron-rich nuclei in the south region of $^{208}$Pb in the nuclear chart. The weak interaction properties, such as the $\log ft$, average shape factor values, half-lives, and neutron emission probabilities, are calculated for these neutron-rich nuclei with the help of newly developed effective interaction [Yuan et al., Phys. Rev. C 106, 044314 (2022)] for $^{208}$Pb region. These calculations have been performed without truncation for a particular model space, however, for some nuclei, a certain truncation has been employed and particle-hole excitations are included in the case of core-breaking nuclei. An extensive comparison with the experimental data has been made and spin parities of several states have been proposed. In this study, we have considered 270 transitions.</description>
