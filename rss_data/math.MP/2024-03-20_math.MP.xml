      <title>Rotation matrix of a charged symmetrical body: one-parameter family of solutions in elementary functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equations of motion of a charged symmetrical body in external constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields are deduced starting from the variational problem, where the body is considered as a system of charged point particles subject to holonomic constraints. The final equations are written for the center-of mass-coordinate, rotation matrix and angular velocity. General solution to the equations of motion is obtained for the case of a charged ball. For the case of a symmetrical charged body (solenoid), the task of obtaining the general solution is reduced to the problem of a one-dimensional cubic pseudo-oscillator. Besides, we present a one-parametric family of solutions to the problem in elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the galaxy rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 21 galaxies, with variations spanning three orders of magnitude in galactic mass, is also reproduced.</description>

      <title>Syntropy in complex systems: A complement to Shannon's Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the syntropy function ($S_N$) and expectancy function ($E_N$), derived from the novel function $\phi$, to provide a refined perspective on complexity, extending beyond conventional entropy analysis. $S_N$ is designed to detect localized coherent events, whereas $E_N$ encapsulates expected system behaviors, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding system dynamics. The manuscript explores essential theorems and properties, underscoring their theoretical and practical implications. Future research will further elucidate their roles, particularly in biological signals and dynamic systems, suggesting a deep interplay between order and chaos.</description>

      <title>Tracy-Widom distribution in four-dimensional super-Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various observables in different four-dimensional superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be computed exactly as Fredholm determinants of truncated Bessel operators. We exploit this relation to determine their dependence on the 't Hooft coupling constant. Unlike the weak coupling expansion, which has a finite radius of convergence, the strong coupling expansion is factorially divergent, necessitating the inclusion of nonperturbative, exponentially small corrections. We develop a method to systematically compute these corrections and discuss the resurgent properties of the resulting transseries.</description>

      <title>On Observation and The Completion of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We start with a discussion of the use of mathematics to model the real world then justify the role of Hilbert space formalism for such modelling in the general context of quantum logic. Following this, the incompleteness of the Schr\"odinger equation is discussed as well as the incompleteness of von Neumann's measurement approach \cite{vN}. Subsequently, it is shown that quantum mechanics is indeed completed by the addition of an observer, however the observer is not described in the Hamiltonian formalism but \emph{necessarily} by the quantum stochastic formalism discovered in \cite{HP}. Consequently, the complete theory of quantum mechanics appears to be the Quantum Filtering Theory \cite{ND,NLF}. Finally, it is shown how Schr\"odinger's cat may be understood as a quantum filter, providing an intuitively realistic model and an insight into how quantum filtering works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a plasma that is created by a high voltage difference $\lambda$, which is known as a Townsend discharge. We consider it to be confined to the region $\Omega$ between two concentric spheres, two concentric cylinders, or more generally between two star-shaped surfaces. We first prove that if the plasma is initially relatively dilute, then either it may remain dilute for all time or it may not, depending on a certain parameter $\kappa(\lambda, \Omega)$. Secondly, we prove that there is a connected one-parameter family of steady states. This family connects the non-ionized gas to a plasma, either with a sparking voltage $\lambda^*$ or with very high ionization, at least in the cylindrical or spherical cases.</description>

      <title>A mathematical foundation for QUMOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We link the QUMOND theory with the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition and introduce a new formula for the gradient of the Mondian potential using singular integral operators. This approach allows us to demonstrate that, under very general assumptions on the mass distribution, the Mondian potential is well-defined, once weakly differentiable, with its gradient given through the Helmholtz-Weyl decomposition. Furthermore, we establish that the gradient of the Mondian potential is an $L^p$ vector field. These findings lay the foundation for a rigorous mathematical analysis of various issues within the realm of QUMOND. Given that the Mondian potential satisfies a second-order partial differential equation, the question arises whether it has second-order derivatives. We affirmatively answer this question in the situation of spherical symmetry, although our investigation reveals that the regularity of the second derivatives is weaker than anticipated. We doubt that a similarly general regularity result can be proven without symmetry assumptions. In conclusion, we explore the implications of our results for numerous problems within the domain of QUMOND, thereby underlining their potential significance and applicability.</description>

      <title>A non-hermitean momentum operator for the particle in a box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a discrete non-hermitean momentum operator, which implements faithfully the non self-adjoint nature of momentum for a particle in a box. Its eigenfunctions are strictly limited to the interior of the box in the continuum limit, with the quarter wave as first non-trivial eigenstate. We show how to construct the corresponding hermitean Hamiltonian for the infinite well as concrete example to realize unitary dynamics. The resulting Hilbert space can be decomposed into a physical and unphysical subspace, which are mutually orthogonal. The physical subspace in the continuum limit reproduces that of the continuum theory and we give numerical evidence that the correct probability distributions for momentum and energy are recovered.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks are referred to as quantum analogues to random walks in mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in long time.</description>

      <title>On Strong Converse Theorems for Quantum Hypothesis Testing and Channel Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong converse theorems refer to the study of impossibility results in information theory. In particular, Mosonyi and Ogawa established a one-shot strong converse bound for quantum hypothesis testing [Comm. Math. Phys, 334(3), 2014], which servers as a primitive tool for establishing a variety of tight strong converse theorems in quantum information theory. In this short note, we demonstrate an alternative one-line proof for this bound via the variational expression of measured R\'enyi divergences [Lett. Math. Phys, 107(12), 2017]. Then, we show that the variational expression is a direct consequence of H\"older's inequality.</description>

      <title>Extremality of stabilizer states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extremality of stabilizer states to reveal their exceptional role in the space of all $n$-qubit/qudit states. We establish uncertainty principles for the characteristic function and the Wigner function of states, respectively. We find that only stabilizer states achieve saturation in these principles. Furthermore, we prove a general theorem that stabilizer states are extremal for convex information measures invariant under local unitaries. We explore this extremality in the context of various quantum information and correlation measures, including entanglement entropy, conditional entropy and other entanglement measures. Additionally, leveraging the recent discovery that stabilizer states are the limit states under quantum convolution, we establish the monotonicity of the entanglement entropy and conditional entropy under quantum convolution. These results highlight the remarkable information-theoretic properties of stabilizer states. Their extremality provides valuable insights into their ability to capture information content and correlations, paving the way for further exploration of their potential in quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We combine Hilbert module and algebraic techniques to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an Hermitian torsion-free connection on the bimodule of differential one-forms of a first order differential calculus. In the presence of the extra structure of a bimodule connection, we give sufficient conditions for uniqueness. We prove that any $\theta$-deformation of a compact Riemannian manifold admits a unique Hermitian torsion-free bimodule connection and provide an explicit construction of it. Specialising to classical Riemannian manifolds yields a novel construction of the Levi-Civita connection on the cotangent bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda = \lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however, only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some aspects of the theory of fermions living on three dimensional spacetime with a flat co-dimension one boundary are discussed, particularly a case where the boundary condition preserves scale and translation invariance but violates the residual Lorentz and conformal symmetries. This case is interesting because the Dirac equation has normalizable stationary edge states which must be taken into account in the quantization. We show that a consequence of the edge states for quantization of the Dirac field is that there are no states of the Dirac field theory which are simultaneously scale, C and P invariant even when these are good symmetries of the theory. The scale invariant states of the Dirac field contain either a nonzero scale covariant momentum density or a U(1) charge density concentrated near the edge.</description>

      <title>Accurate heat currents via reorganised master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.</description>

Abstract: We define and analyze the fermionic entanglement entropy of a Schwarz\-schild black hole horizon for the regularized vacuum state of an observer at infinity. Using separation of variables and an integral representation of the Dirac propagator, the entanglement entropy is computed to be a prefactor times the number of occupied angular momentum modes on the event horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.14445v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Vladimir Fock and the author introduced a geometric structure on surfaces, called higher complex structure, whose moduli space shares several properties with Hitchin's component. In this paper, we establish various links between flat connections and higher complex structures.
  In particular, we study a certain class of connections on a bundle equipped with a line subbundle $L$, which we call $L$-parabolic. These connections are almost flat, and allow a local standard form. A certain family of $L$-parabolic connections is parametrized by the data of a higher complex structure and a cotangent variation. The family of connections being flat implies the compatibility condition of the cotangent variation. Higher diffeomorphisms are realized by the gauge transformation induced by changing $L$. Constructing flat families of connections of this kind is linked to Toda integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study chiral algebra in the reduction of 3D $\mathcal{N} = 2 $ supersymmetric gauge theories on an interval with the $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Dirichlet boundary conditions on both ends. By invoking the 3D ``twisted formalism'' and the 2D $\beta\gamma$-description we explicitly find the perturbative $\overline{Q}_+$ cohomology of the reduced theory. It is shown that the vertex algebras of boundary operators are enhanced by the line operators. A full non-perturbative result is found in the abelian case, where the chiral algebra is given by the rank two Narain lattice VOA, and two more equivalent descriptions are provided. Conjectures and speculations on the nonperturbative answer in the non-abelian case are also given.</description>

      <title>Regularized Integrals on Configuration Spaces of Riemann Surfaces and Cohomological Pairings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of regularized integrals introduced by Li-Zhou that aims to assign finite values to divergent integrals on configuration spaces of Riemann surfaces. We then give cohomological formulations for the extended notion using the tools of current cohomology and mixed Hodge structures. We also provide practical ways of constructing representatives of the corresponding cohomology classes in terms of smooth differential forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long time Schr\"odinger evolution of Lagrangian states $f_h$ on a compact Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$ of negative sectional curvature. We consider two models of semiclassical random Schr\"odinger operators $P_h^\alpha=-h^2\Delta_g +h^\alpha Q_\omega$, $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, where the semiclassical Laplace-Beltrami operator $-h^2\Delta_g$ on $X$ is subject to a small random perturbation $h^\alpha Q_\omega$ given by either a random potential or a random pseudo-differential operator. Here, the potential or the symbol of $Q_\omega$ is bounded, but oscillates and decorrelates at scale $h^{\beta}$, $0&lt; \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$. We prove a quantitative result that, under appropriate conditions on $\alpha,\beta$, in probability with respect to $\omega$ the long time propagation $$\mathrm{e}^{\frac{i}{h}t_h P_h^\alpha } f_h, \quad o(|\log h|)=t_h\to\infty, ~~h\to 0,$$ rescaled to the local scale of $h$ around a uniformly at random chosen point $x_0$ on $X$, converges in law to an isotropic stationary monochromatic Gaussian field -- the Berry Gaussian field. We also provide and $\omega$-almost sure version of this convergence along sufficiently fast decaying subsequences $h_j\to 0$.</description>

      <title>T-Dualities and Courant Algebroid Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Pedestrian's Way to Baxter's Bethe Ansatz for the Periodic XYZ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A chiral coordinate Bethe ansatz method is developed to study the periodic XYZ chain. We construct a set of chiral vectors with fixed number of kinks. All vectors are factorized and have simple structures. Under roots of unity conditions, the Hilbert space has an invariant subspace and our vectors form a basis of this subspace. We propose a Bethe ansatz solely based on the action of the Hamiltonian on the chiral vectors, avoiding the use of transfer matrix techniques. This allows to parameterize the expansion coefficients and derive the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies and eigenstates. Our analytic results agree with earlier approaches, notably by Baxter, and are supported by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Random Linear Systems with Quadratic Constraints: from Random Matrix Theory to replicas and back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present here a pedagogical introduction to the works by Rashel Tublin and Yan V. Fyodorov on random linear systems with quadratic constraints, using tools from Random Matrix Theory and replicas. These notes illustrate and complement the material presented at the Summer School organised within the Puglia Summer Trimester 2023 in Bari (Italy). Consider a system of $M$ linear equations in $N$ unknowns, $\sum_{j=1}^N A_{kj}x_j=b_k$ for $k=1,\ldots,M$, subject to the constraint that the solutions live on the $N$-sphere, $x_1^2+\ldots + x_N^2=N$. Assume that both the coefficients $A_{ij}$ and the parameters $b_i$ be independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. Using two different approaches -- based on Random Matrix Theory and on a replica calculation -- it is possible to compute whether a large linear system subject to a quadratic constraint is typically solvable or not, as a function of the ratio $\alpha=M/N$ and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the $b_i$'s. This is done by defining a quadratic loss function $H({\bf x})=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^M\left[\sum_{j=1}^NA_{kj} x_j-b_k\right]^2$ and computing the statistics of its minimal value on the sphere, $E_{min}=\min_{||\bf x||^2=N}H({\bf x})$, which is zero if the system is compatible, and larger than zero if it is incompatible. One finds that there exists a compatibility threshold $0&lt;\alpha_c&lt;1$, such that systems with $\alpha&gt;\alpha_c$ are typically incompatible. This means that even weakly under-complete linear systems could become typically incompatible if forced to additionally obey a quadratic constraint.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>
