      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in the mixed valence polyoxovanadate cage V$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of spintronic and quantum computing devices increases demand for efficient, energy saving method of spin manipulation at molecular scale. Polyoxovanadate molecular magnets being susceptible to both electric and magnetic fields may serve here as a good base material. In this paper two isostructural anions [V$_{12}$As$_8$O$_{40}$(HCO$_2$)]$^{n-}$ (with $n=3,5$) featuring two different mixed-valence states with itinerant and localized valence electrons are studied. The impact of the electric field on their magnetic properties is investigated by means of two complementary methods informed by magnetic measurements: effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the magnetoelectric effect in theses molecules is induced mostly by relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state and can be detected even at room temperature. These findings can pave the way to practical applications in which an electric field control over spin state is required.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential of magnon polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a rotationally invariant formulation of spin-lattice coupling, we derive a rigorous definition of the chemical potential for magnon-polaron quasiparticles in collinear ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs), valid when magnetoelastic scattering equilibrates magnons and acoustic phonons on timescales much shorter than those associated with quasiparticle-nonconserving relaxation processes. While our microscopic framework applies to generic magnon-phonon interactions, here we focus on high-symmetry crystals where the two transverse acoustic modes form a degenerate doublet. This doublet can combine into circularly polarized phonons, making the chiral selectivity of the coupling manifest: the FM magnon mode hybridizes only with the co-rotating phonon, whereas in collinear AFMs each magnon branch of opposite handedness couples to the phonon of the same chirality. We show that, in both FM and AFM systems, the nonequilibrium magnon-polaron gas is governed by a single chemical potential conjugate to the conserved axial angular momentum. In FMs, the two hybrid branches in the co-rotating sector share this chemical potential, weighted by their magnonic fractions; in AFMs, the four magnon-polaron branches split into two chiral sectors that carry opposite angular momenta and couple with opposite sign to the same chemical potential. Building on this microscopic thermodynamic framework, we formulate a Boltzmann transport theory for magnon-polarons and derive compact expressions for angular-momentum and heat currents that interpolate continuously to the decoupled regime and reproduce the phenomenological magnon-polaron transport framework underlying previous spin Seebeck analyses.</description>

      <title>Perfect impedance matching unlocks sensitive radio-frequency reflectometry in 2D material quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive platforms for realizing high-performance quantum bits (qubits). However, radio-frequency (RF) charge detection, which is a key technique for qubits readout, remains challenging in such systems. We demonstrate RF reflectometry with impedance matching for high-resistance quantum dot devices based on bilayer graphene and molybdenum disulfide. By integrating a tunable strontium titanate (SrTiO3) varactor into a resonant circuit, we achieve nearly perfect impedance matching, enabling sensitive charge detection. The demodulated RF signal clearly shows Coulomb oscillations, and the SrTiO3 varactor exhibits robustness against both magnetic fields and voltage noise on the varactor. Our results establish SrTiO3 varactors as effective tunable matching components for RF reflectometry in high-resistance 2D material quantum devices, providing a foundation for high-speed qubits readout.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic interaction as random field for thermal transport in FPU-$\beta$ lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open quantum theory for the thermal transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-$\beta$(FPU-$\beta$) lattice. In the theory, local bosons(LBs) are introduced as carriers for the transport. The LBs are stimulated by individual atoms in the lattice, which are different from the phonons that are collective motions of the atoms. The LBs move in the FPU chain and are governed by a set of stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The anharmonic interaction between the atoms in the lattice is transformed to a random field by the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and has been implemented in the set of SDEs. By solving the set of SDEs at the steady state, we study the influence of the anharmonic interaction on the thermal transport. Results show that the anharmonic interaction decreases the thermal current by trapping the LBs on the lattice sites, as well as increase the thermal current by enhancing the amount of the LBs for the transport. The competition between these two mechanisms makes the thermal conductivity of the lattice dependent on the anharmonic interaction non-monotonically. The finite size effect of the thermal conductivity has also been captured by the theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coulomb drag signatures of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.</description>

      <title>Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by sequences of two unitaries: periodic, quasiperiodic and random protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of driving the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using two unitary operators $U_1$ and $U_2$ in different combinations; the unitaries differ in the values of the inter-cell hopping amplitudes. Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $\epsilon$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $\epsilon T$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $\epsilon^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $\epsilon$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results.</description>

      <title>Tuning proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been observed in heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene (ML-G) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WSe$_{2}$. Successful tuning of SOC in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures by applying mechanical pressure and electric fields was also demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC. Here, we put these predictions to experimental test in ML-G/ML-WSe$_{2}$/hBN-heterostructures, where the twist angle is determined by aligning fractured edges, and by crystallographic etching of graphene. By performing weak anti-localization measurements, we determine the strength of the Rasbha-type SOC ($\lambda_\mathrm{R}$) and the valley-Zeeman-type SOC ($\lambda_\mathrm{VZ}$). Our experiments confirm a strong twist angle dependence of the proximity-induced SOC in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the tunability of the SOC strength via mechanical pressure, which is in agreement with earlier findings.</description>

      <title>Real-time imaging of slow noisy quasiparticle dynamics at a non-trivial metastable defect in an electronic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium self-assembly is the root of all emergent complexity, including life. In quantum materials emergent metastable states have become a very fashionable topic of research, but the study of resulting mesoscopic state dynamics is hindered by the absence of appropriate methods. Here we pioneer the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice created by a local electromagnetic perturbation. This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries. Two-level system telegraph noise maps at the junction show phase and amplitude that is correlated with the observed electron motion trajectories. Such observation of single-particle dynamics in real time fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements that make use of engineered topologically non-trivial defects.</description>

      <title>Emergent Quantum Valley Hall Insulator from Electron Interactions in Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide Heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of topological phases in moir\'{e} MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayer, highlighting the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions at two holes per moir\'e unit cell $v = 2$. Our analysis uncovers robust Quantum Valley Hall Insulating (QVHI) phase and reveals that long-range interactions alone can mediate the interlayer electron tunneling, generating topologically nontrivial bands even in the absence of the corresponding single-particle hopping. Additionally, we show that in the case of band mixing terms originating both from the interaction and single particle physics a competition between topological states realizing $s$-$wave$ and $p\pm ip$-$wave$ symmetries can appear. Moreover, within the considered theoretical framework, we present that by introducing a small Zeeman field, one can lift the band inversion in one of the valleys. This leads to a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) state with the topological gap opening in a single valley and the other being topologically trivial.</description>

      <title>Topological Pseudospin Hall Effect and Multi-frequency Corner Modes in Kagome-based Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Theory of single-photon emission from neutral and charged excitons in a polarization-selective cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon sources based on neutral or charged excitons in a semiconductor quantum dot are attractive resources for photonic quantum computers and simulators. To obtain indistinguishable photons, the source is pumped on resonance with polarized laser pulses, and the output is collected in orthogonal polarization. However, for sources featuring vertical emission of light, 50% of the emitted photons are unavoidably lost in this way. Here, we theoretically study the quantum dynamics of an exciton embedded in an asymmetric vertical cavity that favors emission in a specific polarization. We identify the configuration for optimal state initialization and demonstrate a path toward near-unity polarized efficiency. We also derive simple analytical formulas for the photon output in each polarization as a function of the Purcell-enhanced emission rates, which shed light on the physical mechanism behind our results.</description>

      <title>Anomalous metallic phase and reduced critical current in superconducting nanowires due to inverse proximity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductor-to-metal transitions (SMTs) are key probes of mesoscopic superconductivity, but their interpretation can be complicated by device geometry and measurement conditions. Here, we study epitaxial InAs-Al nanowires and show that metallic contacts induce an inverse proximity effect (IPE), creating weak spots in the superconductor that strongly suppress the critical current and give rise to an anomalous metallic phase. Using transport measurements supported by Usadel theory, we demonstrate that this phase originates from the contact-induced weakening of superconductivity together with Joule heating, rather than intrinsic material properties. Our findings reveal an overlooked observer effect in mesoscopic superconductors and provide essential guidance for interpreting SMTs and for designing devices based on these systems.</description>

      <title>Positional memory of skyrmions in magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically and analytically study the transient dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets under a magnetic field gradient. We consider skyrmions in a bilayer with antiferromagnetic coupling between the layers. The skyrmions in the two layers move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and the motion is eventually halted with the two skyrmions at a distance from each other. We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approximation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise.</description>

      <title>Tunable giant Purcell enhancement of quantum light emitters by means of acoustic graphene plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable ability of plasmons to boost radiative emission rates, we propose leveraging acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) to realize tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar quantum emitters. These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\% and 89\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $\lambda=1.55$ $\mu$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in Dirac electron tunneling transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.</description>

Abstract: In this perspective, we discuss the unique electronic properties of helical liquids appearing at the boundaries of time-reversal-invariant topological materials and highlight the key challenges impeding progress in this field. We advocate for a deeper theoretical understanding of the many-body aspects of these systems to gain insights into helical liquids and the potential stabilization of topological zero modes.

      <title>On the Fourier transform of the hyperbola and its role in hyperbolic photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent breakthrough studies of wave hyperbolicity in extremely anisotropic natural materials and artificial composites, we investigate the radiation pattern of a localized emitter in a hyperbolic medium. Since the emission of a point source is associated with the Fourier transform of the iso-frequency contours of a medium, we derive and analyze the properties of the Fourier transform of hyperbolic dispersion, which sheds light into the emission properties in the presence of hyperbolic bands. Our analysis leads to a generalized form of Huygens' principle for hyperbolic waves, connecting to the emergence of negative refraction and focusing with hyperbolic media. We also highlight the occurrence of aliasing artifacts in polariton imaging. More broadly, our findings provide analytical tools to model polariton propagation in materials with extreme anisotropy, and may be applied to several other physical platforms featuring hyperbolic responses, from astrophysics to seismology.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multifractality to Enhance Thermal Stability in Mixed-Phase Vanadium Oxide Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium oxide thin films exhibit temperature-driven electronic transitions desirable for sensing and microelectronic applications, yet their performance is often limited by thermal hysteresis. This study demonstrates that electronic stability is governed not simply by roughness or crystallinity but by a unique combination of surface morphological complexity and thermal hysteresis, revealed across films deposited with varying working pressure using Direct Current/Radio Frequency magnetron sputtering. Specifically, the film grown at 15 mTorr shows a distinct convergence of highest morphological vertical complexity and lowest thermal hysteresis, exhibiting nearly reversible transport with activation energies ranging from 0.26 to 0.28 eV and negative temperature coefficients of resistance between -0.0337 and -0.035 K-1. While conventional roughness metrics and mono-fractal parameters do not capture this behavior, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis uncovers a pronounced peak in multifractality strength, which correlates inversely with thermal hysteresis. This highlights multifractality strength as a predictive descriptor of electronic stability, identifying a multiscale structural signature that enhances stress accommodation during thermal cycling. These results define an optimal deposition window and provide a morphology-guided pathway for developing thermally robust mixed-phase vanadium oxide films.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady electron-excitonic complexes coupling in a two-dimensional semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons and their complexes govern optical-related behaviors in semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interaction mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of electronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moir\'e-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.</description>

      <title>Kaganov-Lifshitz-Tanatarov theory for tilted Dirac-cone materials: anisotropic heating from uniform light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that in the tilted Dirac cone materials the non-equilibrium (hot) electron relaxation with phonons is anisotropic in the Brillouin zone. It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!</description>

      <title>Detection of Mpemba effect through good observables in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect refers to the anomalous relaxation of a quantum state that, despite being initially farther from equilibrium, relaxes faster than a closer counterpart. Detecting such a quantum Mpemba effect typically requires full knowledge of the quantum state during its time evolution, which is an experimentally challenging task since state tomography becomes exponentially difficult as system size increases. This poses a significant obstacle in studying Mpemba effect in complex many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by identifying suitable observables that signal rapid relaxation. Moreover, as long as the system equilibrates to a known unique steady-state, it is possible to fully detect the occurrence of quantum Mpemba effect just by measuring the observable for known state preparations. Our approach thus significantly reduces experimental complexity and offers a practical route for observing the quantum Mpemba effect in complex and extended multi-qubit setups.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modulation of Long Range Photon Magnon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence of non-hermitian behavior has been recently demonstrated in cavity magnonics, including the emergence of mode level attraction and exceptional points in spectroscopic measurements. This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics. Our approach offers in situ tunability over the dissipative coupling strength, including complete suppression, without requiring physical modifications to the experimental setup, providing a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Second-Order Topological Superconductors with Tunable Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals, with their protected Dirac points, present an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal. In the normal state near half-filling, the Fermi surface consists of two distinct pockets, each enclosing a Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum ($\textbf{X}=(\pi,0)$ and $\textbf{Y}=(0,\pi)$). Considering an on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interaction, we use self-consistent mean-field theory to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry. We find that an even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is favored as it gives rise to a fully gapped superconducting state. Since the pairing amplitude has opposite signs on the two Dirac Fermi pockets, the superconducting state is identified as a second-order topological superconductor. The hallmark of this topological phase is the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries. Notably, the positions of these Majorana modes are highly controllable and can be manipulated simply by tailoring the boundary sublattice terminations. Our results highlight the promise of nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Phononic Casimir effect between planar objects is investigated by deriving a formalism from the quantum partition function of the system following multiscattering approach. This fluctuation-induced coupling is mediated by phonons modeled as an effective elastic medium. We find that excitations with three types of polarizations arise from the resolved boundary conditions, however the coupling is dominated by only one of these degrees of freedom due to exponential suppression effects in the other two. The obtained scaling laws and dependence on materials properties and temperature suggest effective pathways of interaction control. Scenarios of materials combinations are envisioned where the Phononic Casimir effect is of similar order as the standard Casimir interaction mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We report numerical studies of the linear and nonlinear edge dynamics of a non-harmonically confined macroscopic fractional quantum Hall fluid. In the long-wavelength and weak excitation limit, observable consequences of the fractional transverse conductivity are recovered. The first non-universal corrections to the chiral Luttinger liquid theory are then characterized: for a weak excitation in the linear response regime, cubic corrections to the linear wave dispersion and a broadening of the dynamical structure factor of the edge excitations are identified; for stronger excitations, sizable nonlinear effects are found in the dynamics. The numerically observed features are quantitatively captured by a nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid quantum Hamiltonian that reduces to a driven Korteweg-de Vries equation in the semiclassical limit. Experimental observability of our predictions is finally discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present a theory of mirror-symmetric magic angle twisted trilayer graphene. The electronic properties are described by a Hubbard model with long range tunneling matrix elements. The electronic properties are obtained by solving the mean field Hubbard model. We obtain the bandstructure with characteristic flat bands and a Dirac cone. At charge neutrality, turning on electron-electron interactions results in metallic to antiferomagnetic phase transition, for Hubbard interaction strength considerably smaller than in other graphene multilayers. We analyze the stability of the antiferromagnetic state against the symmetry breaking induced by hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation, and mirror symmetry breaking caused by the application of electric fields that mix the Dirac cone with the flat bands. Additionally, we explore the topological properties of the system, revealing a hidden quantum geometry. Despite the flat bands having zero Chern numbers, the multiband Berry curvature distribution over the moir\'e Brillouin zone exhibits a non-trivial structure. Finally, we propose a mechanism to tune this quantum geometry, providing a pathway to control the system's topological properties.</description>

      <title>Approximate half-integer quantization in anomalous planar transport in $d$-wave altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous planar transport phenomena in a recently identified class of collinear magnetic materials known as $d$-wave altermagnets. The anomalous planar effects manifest in a configuration when the applied electric field/temperature gradient, magnetic field, and the measured Hall voltage are all co-planar, but the planar magnetic field is instrumental in breaking $\hat{C}_{4z}\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ symmetry of the $d$-wave altermagnet, where $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is the time reversal operator, resulting in a Zeeman gap at a shifted Dirac node and a nonzero Berry curvature monopole. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit nearly half-quantized anomalous planar Hall and planar thermal Hall effects at low temperatures that persist over a range of magnetic fields. The angular dependence of the planar transport reveals a $\cos2\phi$ dependence on the magnetic field direction, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle made by the magnetic field. We also discuss the anomalous planar Nernst effect, or transverse thermopower, and demonstrate that the Nernst conductivity peaks when the chemical potential lies just outside the induced Zeeman gap and vanishes within the gap. We further explore the dependence of all three coefficients on the polar and the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field when it is rotated in the full $3D$ space. Our results reveal the presence of approximately half-quantized anomalous planar thermal Hall plateau for a range of in-plane magnetic fields without requiring topological superconductivity and conducting Majorana modes, and can be probed in experiments in $d$-wave altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity} (OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture. Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconducting Majorana fermions platforms in the layered Kitaev Materials: Case study of $Li_2IrO_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in $Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and topological quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Spin current symmetries generated by GdFeCo ferrimagnet across its magnetisation compensation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferrimagnets, composed of antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic sublattices whose net magnetisation can be tuned by temperature, offer a unique platform for probing the symmetry of the spin currents they generate and for identifying the sublattice contributions to these currents. Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself.</description>

      <title>Refermionized theory of the edge modes of a fractional quantum Hall cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making use of refermionization techniques, we map the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid model of the edge modes of a spatially confined fractional quantum Hall cloud developed in our recent work [Phys. Rev. A 107, 033320 (2023)] onto a one-dimensional system of massive and interacting chiral fermions, whose mass and interactions are set by the filling factor of the quantum Hall fluid and the shape of the external confining potential at the position of the edge. As an example of the predictive power of the refermionized theory, we report a detailed study of the dynamic structure factor and of the spectral function of a fractional quantum Hall cloud. Among other features, our refermionized theory provides a physical understanding of the effective decay of the edge excitations and of the universal power-law exponents at the thresholds of the dynamic structure factor. The quantitative accuracy of the refermionized theory is validated against a full two-dimensional calculation based on a combination of exact diagonalization and Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bifurcation and Anomalous Supercurrent in Dissipative Topological Insulator-based Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topological protection and dissipation constitutes a critical frontier in the realization of hybrid quantum devices. Here, we investigate the transport signatures in a dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junction, a platform that directly probes the competition between quantum coherence and loss. We model dissipation by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead to the junction, described effectively by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived using the Lindblad formalism. We observe that the junction exhibits an asymmetric complex Andreev spectrum, where the imaginary energy component imposes a finite lifetime on the quasi-bound states. Furthermore, beyond specific phase intervals, the real component of the spectrum bifurcates: one branch merges with the continuum, while the other penetrates just below the superconducting gap. Crucially, the characteristic zero-energy crossing shifts away from $\phi=\pi$ and acquires a non-zero imaginary component; consequently, the associated Majorana bound states acquire a finite lifetime, signaling a loss of robustness against dissipation. Finally, this spectral asymmetry drives an anomalous supercurrent, manifested as a non-vanishing current at zero phase difference. Our results reveal how dissipation fundamentally reshapes superconducting transport in topological junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description>

      <title>Exciton and biexciton preparation via coherent swing-up excitation in a GaAs quantum dot embedded in micropillar cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme allows efficient and coherent preparation of single photons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, simplifying laser suppression and enhancing photon collection. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. We perform a comparison of the key figures of merit against the well-established two-photon excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion of the exciton state ($\sim$95%) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$) comparable to that under TPE, while also exhibiting a shortened decay time ($\sim$200 ps) reducing the time jitter in the exciton population. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that when both excitation and collection are aligned with one of the exciton dipoles, SUPER results in polarized single-photon emission, exceeding the resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimized excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by the appearance of the biexciton emission line, constituting the first experimental demonstration of biexciton preparation using SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model that incorporates the biexciton state. We also report that a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton dipole, without altering the nominal excitation polarization. This unexpected behavior reveals a new degree of freedom for coherent state preparation. Our findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control.</description>

      <title>Second-Harmonic Magnetoacoustic Ultrasound from Magnetic Nanoparticles under Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of mechanical wave generation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs, 65mT, 800 kHz, at 100ms bursts) in the ultrasonic (US) frequency range. We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric topology: the rope weaving in parameter space</title>

Abstract: Topology, as a mathematical concept, has been introduced into condensed matter physics since the discovery of quantum Hall effect, which characterizes new physical scenario beyond the Landau theory. The topologically protected physical quantities, such as the dissipationless quantum transport of edge/surface states as well as magnetic/dipole quasi-particles like skyrmions/bimerons, have attracted great research enthusiasms in the past decades. In recent years, another kind of topology in condensed matter was revealed in the magnetoelectric parameter space of multiferroics, which deepens our understanding of magnetoelectric physics. This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft. These exotic topological magnetoelectric behaviors may be helpful to pursuit energy-efficient and precise-control devices for spintronics and quantum computing.</description>
