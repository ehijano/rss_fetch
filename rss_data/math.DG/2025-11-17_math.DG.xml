      <title>Properties of Holomorphic $p$-Contact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of compact holomorphic $p$-contact manifolds $X$ that we introduced recently by expanding the discussion to include non-K\"ahler hyperbolicity issues and a differential calculus based on what we call the Lie derivative with respect to a $(0,\,q)$-form with values in the holomorphic tangent bundle of $X$. We also propose the notion of $p$-contact deformations for which we prove a Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov-type unobstructedness theorem to order two. This kind of small deformations of the complex structure is related to the essential horizontal deformations that we introduced in our previous work and forms part of a wider on-going project aimed at developing a non-K\"ahler mirror symmetry theory that was first tested on the Iwasawa manifold and subsequently on Calabi-Yau page-$1$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-Boundedness of the Covariant Riesz Transform on Differential Forms for $p&gt;2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L^p$-boundedness for $p&gt;2$ of the covariant Riesz transform on differential forms is proved for a class of non-compact weighted Riemannian manifolds under certain curvature and volume growth conditions, which in particular settles a conjecture of Baumgarth, Devyver and G\"uneysu~\cite{BDG-23}. As an application, the Calder\'on-Zygmund inequality for $p&gt; 2$ is derived on weighted manifolds, which extends the recent work \cite{CCT} on manifolds without weight.</description>

      <title>A lower bound for the radius of Weinstein's Lagrangian tubular neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an immersed Lagrangian submanifold $L$ in a K\"ahler manifold $(M,\omega)$, there exists a symplectic local diffeomorphism from a tubular neighborhood of the image of the zero section in the normal bundle $T^{\bot}L$ of $L$, equipped with a canonical symplectic form $\tilde{\omega}$, to $(M,\omega)$ whose restriction to $L$ is the identity map by Weinstein's Lagrangian tubular neighborhood theorem, where the image of the zero section in $T^{\bot}L$ is identified with $L$. In this paper, we give a lower bound for the supremum of the radii of tubular neighborhoods that have such a symplectic diffeomorphism into $(M,\omega)$ from below by a constant explicitly given in terms of up to second derivatives of the Riemannian curvature tensor of $M$ and the second fundamental form of $L$. We also give a similar lower bound in the case where $L$ is compact and embedded.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps to Hadamard spaces, and a universal higher Teichm\"{u}ller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient criterion, which we call stability, for a coarse Lipschitz map $f$ from a complete manifold $X$ with Ricci curvature bounded below to a proper Hadamard space $Y$ to be within bounded distance of a harmonic map. We prove uniqueness of the harmonic map under additional assumptions on $X$ and $Y$.
  Using this criterion, we prove a significant generalization of the Schoen-Li-Wang conjecture on quasi-isometric embeddings between rank 1 symmetric spaces. In particular, under a natural generalization of the quasi-isometric condition, we remove the assumption that the target has rank 1. This allows us to define a universal Hitchin component for each $\mathrm{PGL}_d(\mathbb{R})$, generalizing universal Teichm\"uller space, and show that it can be described both as a space of quasi-symmetric positive maps from $\mathbb{RP}^1$ to the flag variety, and as a space of harmonic maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review different notions of synthetic Ricci flow that apply to time-dependent families of metric measure spaces and which are based on properties of the heat flow, ideas from optimal transport, and the asymptotic behaviour of volumes. Each notion equivalently characterises (weighted) Ricci flow for smooth families of weighted Riemannian manifolds. We discuss the features of the different notions on various examples.</description>

      <title>Geometric foundations of thermodynamics in the quantum regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive geometrical formulation of quantum thermodynamics based on contact geometry and principal fiber bundles. The quantum thermodynamic state space is modeled as a contact manifold, with equilibrium Gibbs states forming a Legendrian submanifold that encodes the fundamental thermodynamic relations. A principal fiber bundle over the manifold of density operators distinguishes the quantum state structure from thermodynamic labels: its fibers represent non-equilibrium configurations, and their unique intersections with the equilibrium submanifold enforce thermodynamic consistency. Quasistatic processes correspond to minimizing geodesics under the Bures-Wasserstein metric, leading to minimal dissipation, while the divergence of geodesic length toward rank-deficient states geometrically derives the third law. Non-equilibrium extensions, formulated through pseudo-Riemannian metrics and connections on the principal bundle, introduce curvature-induced holonomy that quantifies irreversibility in cyclic processes. In this framework, the thermodynamic laws in the quantum regime emerge naturally as geometric consequences.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-Based Differentiable Pipeline for Shape Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of engineering designs is limited by non-differentiable components in the typical computer-aided engineering (CAE) workflow, which calculates performance metrics from design parameters. While gradient-based methods could provide noticeable speed-ups in high-dimensional design spaces, codes for meshing, physical simulations, and other common components are not differentiable even if the math or physics underneath them is. We propose replacing non-differentiable pipeline components with surrogate models which are inherently differentiable. Using a toy example of aerodynamic shape optimization, we demonstrate an end-to-end differentiable pipeline where a 3D U-Net full-field surrogate replaces both meshing and simulation steps by training it on the mapping between the signed distance field (SDF) of the shape and the fields of interest. This approach enables gradient-based shape optimization without the need for differentiable solvers, which can be useful in situations where adjoint methods are unavailable and/or hard to implement.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of a diffeomorphism-natural MDL functional to Einstein-Hilbert with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a \(\Gamma\)-convergence result for a diffeomorphism-natural discrete MDL-type functional to the Einstein-Hilbert action with the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. On boundary-fitted, shape-regular meshes we establish interior and boundary blow-ups, identify the Carath\'eodory densities \(f_{\mathrm{in}}=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 R\) and \(f_{\mathrm{bdry}}=\beta_1 K\), and obtain the \(\liminf/\limsup\) bounds via a recovery sequence based on reflected Fermi smoothing. A boundary first-layer asymptotics shows that boundary cells contribute at order \(h^{d-1}\), yielding a global \(O(h)\) boundary remainder, while the interior remainder is \(O(h^2)\). The paper is foundational; Appendix~E specifies a reproducible protocol for rate checks and calibration of \(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\beta_1\).</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Lie algebroid connections on holomorphic principal bundles on compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $\Gamma$--equivariant holomorphic Lie algebroid $(V,\, \phi)$, on a compact Riemann surface $X$ equipped with an action of a finite group $\Gamma$, we investigate the equivariant holomorphic Lie algebroid connections on holomorphic principal $G$--bundles over $X$, where $G$ is a connected affine complex reductive group. If $(V,\,\phi)$ is nonsplit, then it is proved that every holomorphic principal $G$--bundle admits an equivariant holomorphic Lie algebroid connection. If $(V,\,\phi)$ is split, then it is proved that the following four statements are equivalent:
  An equivariant principal $G$--bundle $E_G$ admits an equivariant holomorphic Lie algebroid connection.
  The equivariant principal $G$--bundle $E_G$ admits an equivariant holomorphic connection.
  The principal $G$--bundle $E_G$ admits a holomorphic connection.
  For every triple $(P,\, L(P),\, \chi)$, where $L(P)$ is a Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup $P\, \subset\, G$ and $\chi$ is a holomorphic character of $L(P)$, and every $\Gamma$--equivariant holomorphic reduction of structure group $E_{L(P)}$ of $E_G$ to $L(P)$, the degree of the line bundle over $X$ associated to $E_{L(P)}$ for $\chi$ is zero. 
  The correspondence between $\Gamma$--equivariant principal $G$--bundles over $X$ and parabolic $G$--bundles on $X/\Gamma$ translates the above result to the context of parabolic $G$--bundles.</description>

Abstract: We establish new estimates for the size and structure of the nodal set $\{u=0\}$ and the singular set $\{u=|\nabla u|=0\}$ of solutions $u$ to parabolic inequalities with parabolic Lipschitz coefficients. In particular, we show that almost all of the nodal and singular sets are covered by regular parabolic Lipschitz graphs with estimates, and that both sets satisfy parabolic Minkoswki estimates depending only on a doubling quantity at a point. Many of our results are new even for the heat equation on $\mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>New free boundary minimal annuli of revolution in the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously establish the existence of many free boundary minimal annuli with boundary in a geodesic sphere of $\mathbb{S}^3$. These arise as compact subdomains of a one-parameter family of complete minimal immersions of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^1$ into $\mathbb{S}^3$ described by do Carmo and Dajczer. While the immersed free boundary minimal annuli we exhibit may in general fail to be embedded or contained in a geodesic ball, we show that there is at least a one-parameter family of embedded examples that are contained in geodesic balls whose radius may be less than, equal to or greater than $\pi$/2. After explaining the connection to Otsuki tori, we establish lower bounds on the number of immersed free boundary minimal annuli contained in each Otsuki torus in terms of the corresponding rational number. Finally, we show that some of the recent work of Lee and Seo on isoperimetric inequalities and of Lima and Menezes on index bounds extends to geodesic balls equal to or larger than a hemisphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the Cheeger isoperimetric constant under the Ricci flow on compact surfaces. For metrics on a surface diffeomorphic to $S^2$, we show that the Cheeger constant is non-decreasing along the flow. The proof uses evolution identities for parallel curves together with a viscosity formulation of the evolution of $\log h$ which accommodates for the possible switching of minimizing regions. We also give examples of nontrivial Ricci flows on topological $2$-spheres for which the Cheeger constant remains constant, demonstrating that strict monotonicity is not expected.</description>

      <title>Failure of famous functional inequalities on Finsler manifolds: the influence of $S$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validity of functional inequalities on Finsler metric measure manifolds is based on three non-Riemannian quantities, namely, the reversibility, flag curvature and $S$-curvature induced by the measure. Under mild assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature, it turned out that famous functional inequalities -- as Hardy inequality, Heisenberg--Pauli--Weyl uncertainty principle and Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg inequality -- usually hold on forward complete Finsler manifolds with non-positive $S$-curvature, cf. Huang, Krist\'aly and Zhao [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2020]. In this paper however we prove that -- under similar assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature as before -- the aforementioned functional inequalities fail whenever the $S$-curvature is positive. Accordingly, our results clearly reveal the deep dependence of functional inequalities on the $S$-curvature. As a consequence of these results, we establish analytic aspects of Finsler manifolds, e.g., if the flag curvature is non-positive, the Ricci curvature is bounded from below and the $S$-curvature is positive, then the reversibility turns out to be infinite. Further topological properties and examples are presented on general Funk metric spaces, where the $S$-curvature plays again a decisive role.</description>

      <title>The Miyaoka-Yau inequality for minimal K\"{a}hler klt spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the generalized Bogomolov inequality for reflexive Higgs sheaves defined on the regular locus of compact K\"ahler klt spaces. As an application, we establish the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for all minimal K\"ahler klt spaces. Apart from providing a self-contained formulation and investigation of Higgs sheaves on complex normal spaces, the analytical part of our approach is the establishment of $L^p$-approximate critical Hermitian structures for Higgs orbi-bundles on Gauduchon orbifolds. This also leads to the semistability (resp. generically nefness) of torsion-free sheaves under symmetric, exterior powers and tensor products in the singular setting.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's fourth problem in the constant curvature setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert's fourth problem seeks the classification of metric geometries where straight lines are shortest paths. Its regular case identifies the projectively flat Finsler manifolds. This broader framework breaks the equivalence between projective flatness and constant curvature that holds in the Riemannian setting, creating a more intricate classification problem.
  This paper resolves the long-standing question of how the local structure determines the global topology for such manifolds of constant flag curvature, where flag curvature is the natural generalization of Riemannian sectional curvature. We derive explicit distance formulas for all cases of constant flag curvature. For non-positive constant curvature, we establish a global classification of forward complete manifolds, a uniqueness theorem for forward complete metrics, and a characterization of maximal domains of metrics where exotic examples are constructed. For positive constant curvature, we prove a maximum diameter theorem and show the completion of such manifold is a sphere. A fundamental connection is revealed between Sobolev space nonlinearity and backward incompleteness. This work provides a complete characterization of the global geometry for the regular case of Hilbert's fourth problem with constant flag curvature.</description>

      <title>Classification and stability of penalized pinned elasticae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers critical points of the length-penalized elastic bending energy among planar curves whose endpoints are fixed. We classify all critical points with an explicit parametrization. The classification strongly depends on a special penalization parameter $\hat{\lambda}\simeq 0.70107$. Stability of all the critical points is also investigated, and again the threshold $\hat{\lambda}$ plays a decisive role. In addition, our explicit parametrization is applied to compare the energy of critical points, leading to uniqueness of minimal nontrivial critical points. As an application we obtain eventual embeddedness of elastic flows.</description>

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k\leq n/2$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension \(n\), then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This result addresses a longstanding question by Baum and Bott regarding the functoriality of residues. Also, This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville-Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $ r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2 $</description>

      <title>Stochastic Limit of Growing Gravitational Wave Memory from Sources in the Early Universe and Astrophysical Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt;1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.</description>
