      <title>Residence-time theory applied to circulating-fuel reactors: zero-power analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circulating-fuel reactors (CFRs) lose reactivity when delayed-neutron precursors (DNPs) drift out of the core and may regain part of it when the fuel re-enters the core. This paper formulates a physics-based description of both effects by combining DNP transport with residence-time theory. Then, treating the core and ex-core regions as two mixing volumes in series, closed-form expressions for (i) the static reactivity loss due to precursor drift and (ii) the zero-power transfer function that governs linearised dynamics are derived. When the gamma residence-time distributions are used, the new framework is shown to reduce to the plug-flow and Continuous-Stirred-Tank-Reactor limits as special cases, while generalising to intermediate mixing regimes via a single parameter: the degree of mixing. Performed parameter studies show that DNP recirculation has the highest impact when core and ex-core residence times are comparable and the product of the DNP decay constant and the in-core residence time is small. Benchmarks against the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment are able to reproduce the measured static loss ($k_0 \approx 0.32$ \$) and its frequency response, with $\approx$20% of the steady-state DNP worth arising from recirculation. Additionally, for the EVOL reference Molten-Salt Fast Reactor the model is shown to agree well with the results of high-fidelity Serpent-2 calculations coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics. Overall, the residence-time approach offers a computationally light yet versatile tool for sensitivity studies and generation of physical intuition for the behaviour of CFRs. Foundation for extensions to importance weighting of DNPs and application of the framework to time-domain analysis is also briefly sketched.</description>

      <title>DDNet: A Unified Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Semiconductor Device Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of semiconductor devices plays a critical role in the development of new technology nodes and next-generation devices. Semiconductor device designers largely rely on advanced simulation software to solve the drift-diffusion equations, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe carrier transport in semiconductor devices. While these tools perform well for forward modeling, they are not suitable to address inverse problems, for example, determining doping profiles, material, and geometrical parameters given a desired device performance. Meanwhile, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity in recent years thanks to their ability to efficiently and accurately solve inverse problems at minimal computational cost compared to forward problems. In this study, we introduce the Drift-Diffusion Network (DDNet), a unified physics-informed deep learning solver for the forward and inverse mesh-free solutions of the drift-diffusion equations of semiconductor device modeling. Using prototypical device configurations in one- and two spatial dimensions, we show that DDNet achieves low absolute and relative error compared to traditional simulation software while additionally solving user-defined inverse problems with minimal computational overhead. We expect that DDNet will benefit semiconductor device modeling by facilitating exploration and discovery of novel device structures across comprehensive parameter sets in a fully automated way.</description>

      <title>Generative Quasi-Continuum Modeling of Confined Fluids at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-efficient, multiscale framework for predicting the density profiles of confined fluids at the nanoscale. While accurate density estimates require prohibitively long timescales that are inaccessible by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, machine-learned molecular dynamics (MLMD) offers a scalable alternative, enabling the generation of force predictions at ab initio accuracy with reduced computational cost. However, despite their efficiency, MLMD simulations remain constrained by femtosecond timesteps, which limit their practicality for computing long-time averages needed for accurate density estimation. To address this, we propose a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based quasi-continuum approach that predicts the long-time behavior of force profiles along the confinement direction, conditioned on noisy forces extracted from a limited AIMD dataset. The predicted smooth forces are then linked to continuum theory via the Nernst-Planck equation to reveal the underlying density behavior. We test the framework on water confined between two graphene nanoscale slits and demonstrate that density profiles for channel widths outside of the training domain can be recovered with ab initio accuracy. Compared to AIMD and MLMD simulations, our method achieves orders-of-magnitude speed-up in runtime and requires significantly less training data than prior works.</description>

      <title>PCGBandit: One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.</description>

      <title>Insertion space in repulsive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.</description>

      <title>Diameter-Controlled High-Order Vortex States and Magnon Hybridization in VSe2 Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curved magnets offer a rich phase diagram and hold great promise for next-generation spintronic technologies. This study establishes the paramount significance of high-order vortex states (e.g., 3$\varphi$ with winding number $n$ &gt; 1) in VSe2 nanotubes, which uniquely enable magnonic functionalities fundamentally inaccessible to conventional magnetic systems. These states arise from diameter-dependent competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic ($J_1$) and longer-range antiferromagnetic ($J_2$/$J_3$) couplings, as rigorously validated through density-functional theory calculations and Heisenberg modeling of phase diagrams. Critically, by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that high-order vortex configurations unlock an intrinsic hybridization mechanism governed by strict orbital angular momentum (OAM) selection rules ($\Delta l = \pm 2(n-1)$) -- a process strictly forbidden in fundamental vortices ($n$ = 1) -- generating complex high-OAM magnons with measurable topological charge. This is vividly demonstrated in the 3$\varphi$ state, where hybridization between $l$ = -4, 0 and 4 modes produces eight-petal magnon density patterns. Such states provide an essential platform-free solution for generating high-OAM magnons, wchich is crucial for spin-wave-based information transport. These findings establish a predictive theoretical framework for controlling high-order vortex states in curved magnets and highlight VSe2 nanotubes as a promising platform for exploring complex magnetism and developing future magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Accuracy analysis and optimization of scale-independent third-order WENO-Z scheme with critical-point accuracy preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the order degradation at critical points in the WENO3-Z scheme, some improvements have been proposed , but these approaches generally fail to consider the occurrence of critical points at arbitrary positions within grid intervals, resulting in their inability to maintain third-order accuracy when a first-order critical point (CP1) occurs. Also, most previous improved schemes suffer from a relatively large exponent p of the ratio of global to local smoothness indicators, which adversely affects the numerical resolution. Concerning these limitations, introduced here is an accuracy-optimization lemma demonstrating that the accuracy of nonlinear weights can be enhanced providing that smoothness indicators satisfy specific conditions, thereby establishing a methodology for elevating the accuracy of nonlinear weights. Leveraging this lemma, a local smoothness indicator is constructed with error terms achieving second-order in smooth regions and fourth-order at CP1, alongside a global smoothness indicator yielding fourth-order accuracy in smooth regions and fifth-order at CP1, enabling the derivation of new nonlinear weights that meet accuracy requirements even when employing p=1. Furthermore, a resolution-optimization lemma is proposed to analyze the relationship between parameters in local smoothness indicators and resolution. By integrating theoretical analysis with numerical practices, free parameters in non-normalized weights and local smoothness indicators are determined under the balance of numerical resolution and robustness, which leads to the development of WENO3-ZES4, a new WENO3-Z improvement that preserves the optimal order at CP1 especially with p=1. 1D and 2D validating tests show that the new scheme consistently achieves third-order in the case of CP1 regardless of its position and exhibits good resolution as well as preferable robustness.</description>

      <title>Optimal Landau-type closure parameters for two-fluid simulations of plasma turbulence at kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two fluid simulations using local Landau-fluid closures derived from linear theory provide an efficient computational framework for plasma modelling, since they bridge the gap between computationally intensive kinetic simulations and fluid descriptions. Their accuracy in representing kinetic effects depends critically on the validity of the linear approximation used in the derivation: the plasma should not be too far from local thermodynamic equilibrium, LTE. However, many of the problems where these models are of particular interest (such as plasma turbulence and instabilities) are in fact quite far from LTE. The question then arises, if kinetic scale processes are still sufficiently well captured outside of the theoretical regime of applicability of the closure. In this paper, we show that two fluid simulations with Landau fluid closures can effectively reproduce the energy spectra obtained with fully kinetic Vlasov simulations, used as references, as long as the local closure parameter is appropriately chosen. Our findings validate the usage of two fluid simulations with Landau-fluid closure as a possible alternative to fully kinetic simulations of turbulence, in cases where being able to simulate extremely large domains is of particular interest.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry-Constrained Framework for Band Inversions in Photonic Crystals with $C_n$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of a unified theoretical framework for characterizing band inversions across different crystal symmetries hinders the rapid development of topological photonic band engineering. To address this issue, we have constructed a framework constrained by symmetry $k \cdot p$ that universally models bands near high-symmetry points for symmetric photonic crystals $C_6$, $C_4$, $C_3$, and $C_2$. This framework enables a coefficient-free quantitative diagnosis of band topology. We have demonstrated the power of this framework by systematically engineering band inversions. In $C_6$ crystals, we induce a reopening of the linear gap at $\Gamma$. In $C_4$ systems, mirror symmetry enforces a characteristic quadratic coupling leading to distinct spectral features. Our analysis further reveals that a lone $E$ doublet prevents inversion at the $\Gamma$ point in $C_3$ symmetry, while $C_2$ symmetry facilitates a unique inversion of $Y$ pointsints with anisotropic gap. This symmetry-first, fit-free approach establishes a direct link between experimental band maps and the extraction of fundamental topological parameters. It offers a universal tool for inversion and coupling-order identification.</description>

      <title>Quantifying model prediction sensitivity to model-form uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-form uncertainty (MFU) in assumptions made during physics-based model development is widely considered a significant source of uncertainty; however, there are limited approaches that can quantify MFU in predictions extrapolating beyond available data. As a result, it is challenging to know how important MFU is in practice, especially relative to other sources of uncertainty in a model, making it difficult to prioritize resources and efforts to drive down error in model predictions. To address these challenges, we present a novel method to quantify the importance of uncertainties associated with model assumptions. We combine parameterized modifications to assumptions (called MFU representations) with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis to measure the importance of assumptions. We demonstrate how, in contrast to existing methods addressing MFU, our approach can be applied without access to calibration data. However, if calibration data is available, we demonstrate how it can be used to inform the MFU representation, and how variance-based sensitivity analysis can be meaningfully applied even in the presence of dependence between parameters (a common byproduct of calibration).</description>

      <title>Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations in Covariant Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form, which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on curved manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Pathway to Practical Quantum Advantage in Solving Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) promises to tackle classically intractable problems. A key milestone is solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), which has remained formidable for quantum algorithms due to their high input-output overhead and nonlinearity. Here, we establish a full-stack framework that charts a practical pathway to a quantum advantage for large-scale NSE simulation. Our approach integrates a spectral-based input/output algorithm, an explicit and synthesized quantum circuit, and a refined error-correction protocol. The algorithm achieves an end-to-end exponential speedup in asymptotic complexity, meeting the lower bound for general quantum linear system solvers. Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis and optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical resources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis demonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million physical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days -- outperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a century. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum speedup and the practical deployment of high-performance scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Frequency Dependent Polarizability for 1D Periodic Systems at Coupled Cluster with Single and Double Excitations Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first implementation of the frequency-dependent electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability for 1D periodic systems computed with the coupled cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) method with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). The implementation is performed in the CCResPy open-source software, based on Python and the NumPy library. The complete equations and many details of the implementation are discussed. The test calculations show the impact on this linear response property of passing from a single molecule to a periodic chain, where the relative magnitude of the polarizability tensor elements is inverted. This work also explores the convergence towards the PBC thermodynamic limit with k-space sampling, and some remaining issues in the definition of the electric dipole operator for periodic systems. This work represents a significant step forward for the simulation of optical response properties for solid-state materials with accurate and systematically improvable quantum mechanical methods.</description>

      <title>Investigating the sliding behavior of graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a Euler-Bernoulli beam finite element (FE) model to study the interlayer interaction mechanics of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) over a graphene substrate. The FE model is calibrated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing the potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. This study focuses mainly on the effect of boundary conditions on sliding behavior and strain transfer between layers when the substrate is subjected to uniform biaxial deformations. The interlayer shearing or sliding behavior is found to depend on the presence of critical parameters, namely, the applied strain to the substrate and the length of the GNR. The FE results indicate that the applied strain transferred from the substrate to the GNR varies linearly up to a critical value ec beyond which it decreases suddenly. Further, ec is found to appear beyond a critical GNR length, Le is approximately 14 nm. Furthermore, a length parameter Ld is approximately 10 nm is computed, beyond which the sliding of GNR is dissipative. Through FE simulations, it is also found that for a GNR length is greater than or equal to 17 nm, the edge pulling force saturates. Our results also highlight the importance of the inertia of GNR on its sliding for different boundary conditions. It is also concluded that the maximum strain that can be transferred to GNR lies between 0.59% and 1.15%. The results of the FE approach align with MD simulations within an error of approximately 10% that can be attributed to the choice of material parameters and the simulation setup.</description>

      <title>Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of coherent structures in developed turbulence can be described as a self-organization process, where macroscopic order emerges from a chaotic background through nonequilibrium phase transitions. We model this mechanism by simulating an ensemble of locally coupled classical oscillators, representing the oscillatory modes of fluctuation within a turbulent medium, which synchronize via a propagating Kuramoto-like interaction field. Upon synchronization, the system spontaneously self-organizes into dense structures, and we demonstrate a tendency for those structures to form quantized loop currents of phase information. These currents are governed by topological constraints that arise from statistical instabilities within the system's oscillatory interaction network. We show that the power spectral density of these emergent structures exhibits a stable, universal power-law behaviour, with spectral indices characteristic of natural plasma turbulence. These findings suggest that the statistical markers of turbulence can arise from universal principles of topological self-organization, independent of the system's specific physical constraints.</description>

      <title>A second-order volumetric boundary treatment for the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new volumetric-type boundary treatment is introduced for the lattice Boltzmann method. Populations are projected onto a discontinuous piecewise linear basis and streamed using an exact geometrical mapping. The method is implemented in 2D for convex, stationary geometries. Stability is verified through a novel analysis tool based on the eigenvalues of the streaming operation. A convergence rate of $\geq2$ is achieved, indicating improved accuracy over precursor methods. For flow around a 2D airfoil, the method yields better lift and drag predictions.</description>

      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a new method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). This method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known equations of state (EOSs) with fixed parameters using the SLM, accurately recreating high-fidelity results while achieving a computational speed-up of $\approx 2.4 \times 10^4$. We test our parametric SLM method for a two-parameter quarkyonic EOS against high-fidelity RK4 TOV calculations and find a computational speedup of $\approx 7.0 \times 10^4$. Hence, SLM is an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods employed in this work is openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>

      <title>MDDM: A Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model to Predict Particle Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery and study of new material systems rely on molecular simulations that often come with significant computational expense. We propose MDDM, a Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model, which is capable of predicting a valid output conformation for a given input pair potential function. After training MDDM on a large dataset of molecular dynamics self-assembly results, the proposed model can convert uniform noise into a meaningful output particle structure corresponding to an arbitrary input potential. The model's architecture has domain-specific properties built-in, such as satisfying periodic boundaries and being invariant to translation. The model significantly outperforms the baseline point-cloud diffusion model for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros of 2D Nearest-Neighbor Antiferromagnetic Ising Models: A Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of general grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a central part of microstructure evolution, grain boundary (GB) migration is believed to be both monolithic and unidirectional. But here, we introduce the concept of GB decomposition: one GB separates into two new GBs by exerting differential Peach-Koehler forces on its disconnections. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to reveal the disconnection mechanisms and direction-dependent motion behaviors associated with the reversible decomposition of a nickel {\Sigma}7 general GB. We also observed a decomposition-like process in a high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) dataset of high purity nickel polycrystal (Science 2021, 374, 189-193), and performed HEDM-data-based simulations to confirm it. The decomposition should be considered as a new GB kinetic behavior, based on its particularity and potential universality.</description>

      <title>Collective ballistic motion explains fast aggregation in adhesive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by motile cells in tissue formation, we find that active systems of self-aligning adhesive particles undergo ballistic aggregation through a flocking transition. This kinetic regime emerges when the cluster persistence length grows faster with cluster mass than the intercluster distance does. We also identify and explain distinct non-collective kinetic regimes, including biologically relevant long-lived transients. Our analytical and numerical results offer a unified framework explaining the broad range of experimentally observed aggregation exponents in cellular systems and reveal physical principles potentially critical for timely tissue organization.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Plane-Wave Born and Distorted Waves approximations for electron-impact collision strength computations: the sample case of Sr II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger in 2017 (GW170817) and the associated kilonova (AT2017gfo) confirmed these events as key sites for heavy element production through the r-process. Subsequent observations, including late-time spectra with JWST, have highlighted the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition, radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.</description>
