      <title>Downscaling GRACE-derived ocean bottom pressure anomalies using self-supervised data fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravimetry measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite mission provide an essential way to monitor changes in ocean bottom pressure ($p_b$), which is a critical variable in understanding ocean circulation. However, the coarse spatial resolution of the GRACE(-FO) fields blurs important spatial details, such as $p_b$ gradients. In this study, we employ a self-supervised deep learning algorithm to downscale global monthly $p_b$ anomalies derived from GRACE(-FO) observations to an equal-angle $0.25^\circ$ grid in the absence of high-resolution ground truth. The optimization process is realized by constraining the outputs to follow the large-scale mass conservation contained in the gravity field estimates while learning the spatial details from two ocean reanalysis products. The downscaled product agrees with GRACE(-FO) solutions over large ocean basins at the millimeter level in terms of equivalent water height and shows signs of outperforming them when evaluating short spatial scale variability. In particular, the downscaled $p_b$ product has more realistic signal content near the coast and exhibits better agreement with tide gauge measurements at around 80% of 465 globally distributed stations. Our method presents a novel way of combining the advantages of satellite measurements and ocean models at the product level, with potential downstream applications for studies of the large-scale ocean circulation, coastal sea level variability, and changes in global geodetic parameters.</description>

      <title>A multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel physically-based multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche. The model is built on a multi-phase mass flow model and extends a two-phase rock-ice avalanche model. It considers rock, ice and fluid; includes the mechanism of ice-melting and a rigorously derived dynamically changing general temperature equation for avalanching bulk mass, the first of its kind. It explains advection-diffusion of heat including the heat exchange across the rock-ice avalanche body, basal heat conduction, production and loss of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, a general formulation of the ice melting rate and enhancement of temperature due to basal entrainment. The temperature equation includes a composite term containing coupled dynamics: rate of change of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves, characterizing distinctive thermo-mechanical processes. The model highlights essential aspects of rock-ice avalanches. Lateral heat productions play an important role in temperature evolution. Fast moving avalanches produce higher amount of heat. Fast ice melting results in substantial change in temperature. We formally derive the melting efficiency dependent general fluid production rate. The model includes internal mass and momentum exchanges between the phases and mass and momentum productions due to entrainment. The latter significantly changes the state of temperature; yet, the former exclusively characterizes rock-ice avalanche. Temperature changes are rapid when heat entrainment across the avalanche boundary is substantial. It also applies to basal heat conduction. A strong coupling exists between phase mass and momentum balances and the temperature equation. The new model offers the first-ever complete dynamical solution for simulating rock-ice avalanche with changing temperature.</description>

      <title>Causality for Earth Science -- A Review on Time-series and Spatiotemporal Causality Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey paper covers the breadth and depth of time-series and spatiotemporal causality methods, and their applications in Earth Science. More specifically, the paper presents an overview of causal discovery and causal inference, explains the underlying causal assumptions, and enlists evaluation techniques and key terminologies of the domain area. The paper elicits the various state-of-the-art methods introduced for time-series and spatiotemporal causal analysis along with their strengths and limitations. The paper further describes the existing applications of several methods for answering specific Earth Science questions such as extreme weather events, sea level rise, teleconnections etc. This survey paper can serve as a primer for Data Science researchers interested in data-driven causal study as we share a list of resources, such as Earth Science datasets (synthetic, simulated and observational data) and open source tools for causal analysis. It will equally benefit the Earth Science community interested in taking an AI-driven approach to study the causality of different dynamic and thermodynamic processes as we present the open challenges and opportunities in performing causality-based Earth Science study.</description>

      <title>Does the Earth's rotation speed really tend to accelerate for a long time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently published studies suggested that the difference between Universal and Coordinated Time UT1-UTC could reach a large positive value in a few years, making it necessary to introduce a negative leap second into the UTC scale for the first time in its history. Based on the latest UT1 series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and its prediction, it was shown that the tendency to acceleration of the Earth's rotation observed over past four years most likely will return to the deceleration, which is the usual behavior of the Earth rotational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Similarity to earthquakes again: periodic radio pulses of the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 are accompanied by aftershocks like fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that the time correlations of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) are similar to earthquake aftershocks. Motivated by the association between FRBs and magnetars, here we report correlation function analyses in the time-energy space for the 563 periodic radio pulses and the 579 X-ray short bursts from the magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which is known to have generated FRBs. Although radio pulses are concentrated near the fixed phase of the rotational cycle, we find that when multiple pulses occur within a single cycle, their correlation properties (aftershock production probability, aftershock rate decaying in power of time, and more) are similar to those of extragalactic FRBs and earthquakes. A possible interpretation is that the radio pulses are produced by rupture of the neutron star crust, and the first pulse within one cycle is triggered by external force periodically exerted on the crust. The periodic external force may be from the interaction of the magnetosphere with material ejected in an outburst. For X-ray bursts, we found no significant correlation signal, though correlation on the same time scale as radio pulses may be hidden due to the long event duration. The aftershock similarity between the periodic radio pulsation and FRBs is surprising, given that the two are energetically very different, and therefore the energy sources would be different. This suggests that the essence of FRB-like phenomena is starquakes, regardless of the energy source, and it is important to search for FRB-like bursts from neutron stars with various properties or environments.</description>
