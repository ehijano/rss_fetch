      <title>Compression failure of porous ceramics: A computational study about the effect of volume fraction on damage evolution and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work describes a numerical method to study the nature of compressive failure of porous ceramics in relation to its volume fraction. The microstructure of an alumina-based foam material manufactured by mechanical stirring of a slurry is studied here. A finite element-based compressive failure simulation of a real microstructure obtained from microtomography (micro-CT) scans is conducted. A recently developed microstructure reconstruction algorithm is utilized to generate artificial microstructures statistically equivalent to the real one obtained from micro-CT. The accuracy of the reconstruction procedure is established by comparing the simulated compression behavior of the reconstructed microstructure with that of the real one along with the experimentally measured results. The effect of sample size on the simulated compression behavior is studied by computing compression stress-strain behavior for varying sizes of the reconstructed microstructures. Further, artificial microstructures of the porous ceramic with different volume fractions are reconstructed along with computing compression stress-strain behavior to establish relationship between ceramic content (volume fraction) and compressive strength of this material. The nature of the compressive failure for microstructures with different volume fractions is studied and the results are compared with the analytical models and the experimental observations available in the literature.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Fluidic Kirigami Metasurface for Ultrasonic Holographic Lensing and Haptic Interfacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphing surfaces provide a versatile tool to advance the functionalities of high-performance aircraft, soft robots, biomedical devices, and human-machine interfaces. However, achieving precise shape transformation and mechanical property control remains challenging due to nonlinearity, design constraints, and the difficulty of coordinating multiple constituent materials across a continuous surface. To this end, this study unveils that Kirigami art can inspire novel solutions. More specifically, the geometric principles of Kirigami can be exploited to design and fabricate fluidic metasurfaces capable of highly accurate shape morphing and output force control, all via a single pressure input. This study presents a systematic approach to designing Kirigami for tuning the local deformation and force output through extensive nonlinear modeling and experiment validation on two archetypal patterns: concentric square and circular cuts. The potentials of this approach are demonstrated via two multiphysics case studies: (1) an acoustic holography lens for ultrasonic wave steering, achieving highly accurate deformation control under a single global pressure input, and (2) a haptic device with a small volume, constant contact area, and high-resolution output force. The fluidic Kirigami concept allows for simple yet effective adaptation to different shape and stiffness requirements, paving the way for a new family of scalable and programmable morphing surfaces.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Light-Induced Microwave Mode Tuning in a Rutile TiO$_2$ Whispering Gallery Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of transient nonlinear optical effects in a macroscopic whispering gallery mode resonator made of rutile TiO$_2$, demonstrating strong optical-microwave transduction under laser irradiation. By comparing the effects of ultraviolet (UV, 385 nm) and near-infrared (NIR, 700 nm) radiation, we find that the UV-induced effects are significantly amplified, consistent with the material's semiconductor bandgap energy. The interaction results in frequency shifts of microwave modes and changes in quality factor, suggesting a localized saturable refractive index tuning. This may be attributed to the saturation of a spin transition of a dopant ion within the crystal lattice. Remarkably, these effects are observed at low optical powers, down to nanowatt levels, indicating high sensitivity and efficient of light-matter interaction in this system. The phenomenon is centered around 15 GHz, yet electron spin resonance measurements reveal no zero-field splitting at this frequency, suggesting an alternative mechanism beyond conventional spin resonance. These findings highlight the potential of low-power optical control of microwave modes in high-Q resonators for applications in quantum technologies, sensing, and reconfigurable photonic-microwave systems.</description>

      <title>Novel design of biplanar electrodes in a multiwell plate for transepithelial electrical resistance measurement in 3D cell cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in microphysiological systems have underscored the need for novel sensing and monitoring systems specifically designed for three-dimensional (3D) cell culture. In this article, an original architecture of a cell-culture multiwell plate embedding an impedance spectroscopy monitoring system is presented alongside a fast and straightforward fabrication process that allows scale-up production for further industrial exploitation. Our proposed approach involves a biplanar electrode configuration, enabling real-time and high-throughput impedance spectroscopy measurements through a 3D biological construct. This configuration not only allows for non-invasive electrical characterization of a 3D tissue layer, but also offers the capability to thoroughly analyze and understand the characteristics of any type of biological barrier and 3D tissue. The proof of concept for the developed system has been effectively validated for measuring impedance across both endothelial and mouse myoblast monolayers cultured within a 3D collagen biomimicking matrix. Moreover, transepithelial electrical resistance values, which vary with cell type and duration of cell culture, were effectively determined from the impedance spectra. The obtained results showed that the proposed device allows the monitoring of tight junction and cell layer formation over time without inducing alterations to the cells.</description>

      <title>A scalable quadratic nonlinear silicon photonics platform with printable entangled photon-pair sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of second-order optical nonlinearities into scalable photonic platforms remains a key challenge due to their large sensitivity to fabrication variations. Here, we present a scalable quadratic nonlinear platform that harnesses the maturity and scalability of existing CMOS processes by heterogeneously integrating periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) onto a silicon photonics platform. A generic PPLN design enables frequency conversion on two distinct waveguide geometries with efficiencies comparable to LNOI rib waveguides. We achieve reproducible phase-matching across the full radius of a commercial 200 mm silicon photonics wafer, leveraging superior CMOS fabrication tolerances. Furthermore, we introduce a tuning mechanism for both blue- and red-shifting of the operating wavelength, fully compensating fabrication-induced offsets. This enables deterministic phase-matching over an entire wafer and yields a strategy for wafer-scale phase-matched quadratic nonlinearities. Finally, we realize printable photon-pair sources via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, highlighting the platform's potential for large-scale quantum optical circuits. These results pave the way for wafer-scale integration of second-order optical nonlinearities in large photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Recombination velocities at grain boundaries in solar-cell absorbers -- revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work revisits the recombination velocities ($s_{\mathrm{GB}}$) of minority-charge carriers determined at grain boundaries in polycrystalline absorber materials for solar cells. The equations describing $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ as well as the barriers for electrons and holes were derived. It is shown that for given net-doping density and absolute temperature, the experimentally determined recombination velocity of a specific grain boundary depends only on the excess-charge density at this planar defect as well as on the prefactor $s_{\mathrm{GB,0}}$ describing the nonradiative recombination. Value ranges for these two quantities can be determined for any measured $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ value. When analyzing $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ datasets acquired on various (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se$_2$ and microcrystalline Si absorbers, it is apparent that both, the excess-charge density and the prefactor $s_{\mathrm{GB,0}}$, remain within about the same orders of magnitude for all grain boundaries analyzed in a specific absorber. The broad range of the recombination velocities over several orders magnitude indicate upward as well as downward band bending, and the band-bending values are on the order of several $\pm$10 meV for all materials analyzed.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity of Wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N Heterovalent Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin films of aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) were synthesized via reactive magnetron sputtering for Hf contents up to $x$ = 0.13. X-ray diffraction showed a single $c$-axis oriented wurtzite phase for all films. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated homogeneous Al:Hf distribution through the thin films and confirmed their insulating character. A collection of complementary tests showed unambiguous polarization inversion, and thus ferroelectricity in multiple samples. Current density vs. electric field hysteresis measurements showed distinct ferroelectric switching current peaks, the piezoelectric coefficient d$_{33,f,meas}$ measured using a double beam laser interferometer (DBLI) showed a reversal in sign with similar magnitude, and anisotropic wet etching confirmed field-induced polarization inversion. This demonstrates the possibility of using tetravalent--and not just trivalent--alloying elements to enable ferroelectricity in AlN-based thin films, highlighting the compositional flexibility of ferroelectricity in wurtzites and greatly expanding the chemistries that can be considered for future devices.</description>

      <title>GHz-speed wavefront shaping metasurface modulators enabled by resonant electro-optic nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of light through biasing of nanoscale antennas present a route to compact, sub-micron thick modulator devices. However, most platforms face limitations in bandwidth, absolute optical efficiency, and tuning response. Here, we present electro-optically tunable metasurfaces capable of both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping in the telecom range. Our resonant electro-optic nanoantenna design consists of a silicon nanobar atop thin-film lithium niobate, with gold electrodes. The silicon nanobar is a periodically perturbed optical waveguide that supports high quality factor (Q $&gt;$ 1000) guided mode resonances excited with free space light. Applying a voltage bias to the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the resonant behavior of the silicon nanobar through evanescent mode overlap. We demonstrate an absolute transmittance modulation of 7.1% with $\pm$5 V applied voltage, and show the dependence of this modulation behavior on the resonance quality factor. We additionally study the electrode limitations on modulation bandwidth, demonstrating bandwidths exceeding 800 MHz. Finally, we show how this resonant antenna platform can be used to design wavefront shaping metasurfaces. We demonstrate a beamsplitting metasurface device, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. The high-speed modulation and wavefront control capabilities of this platform provide a foundation for compact, high bandwidth free space communications and sensing devices.</description>

      <title>Automated Imaging of the Annihilation of a Transverse Domain Wall in Patterned Magnetic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging the magnetic domain wall behavior in patterned thin films under external stimuli can enable understanding the underlying energy landscape as well as the role of local microstructure and defects. We present an automated workflow for in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy to image magnetic domain walls at the nanometer length scale and at a time resolution in the sub-millisecond regime - the latter of which is limited by the speed of the available camera. Our workflow is modular and can be broadly applied to various types of in-situ experiments, taking us a step closer to the future of autonomous imaging of nanomagnetic films with electron microscopy. Using our workflow, we show the transformation of a transverse domain wall with sub-millisecond time resolution under the application of an in-situ transverse magnetic field, a study of whose dynamics are essential in the design of future domain wall mediated spintronic device applications.</description>

Abstract: Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT/LSMO/BCZT) sandwich films were elaborated using the sol-gel spin coating process. The dielectric properties displayed excellent thermal stability with the temperature coefficient of capacitance, TCC, remaining within 10% between -50 C and 300 C. The high energy storage density, Wrec, of 11.8 J/cm3 observed in this sandwich films, is nearly twice as high as that of the BCZT films, with an efficiency, n, of 77% under a weak electric field of 800 kV/cm. Furthermore, the stability of Wrec and n was observed along the studied temperature interval making them promising candidates for high-temperature energy storage capacitors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Efficient Thermally Undercut Silicon Photonic Devices in a 300 mm CMOS Foundry Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonic devices fundamental to high-density wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical links and photonic switching networks, such as resonant modulators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), are highly sensitive to fabrication variations and operational temperature swings. However, thermal tuning to compensate for fabrication and operational temperature variations can result in prohibitive power consumption, challenging the scalability of energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we develop and demonstrate a wafer-scale thermal undercut in a 300 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry that dramatically improves the thermal isolation of thermo-optic devices by selectively removing substrate material beneath the waveguides and resonators. This approach significantly reduces the power required for thermal tuning across multiple device architectures, achieving almost a 5$\times$ improvement in tuning efficiency in a state-of-the-art 4.5 $\mu$m radius microdisk modulator and a 40$\times$ improvement in efficiency for a MZI phase shifter. Additionally, to the best of the authors' knowledge, we demonstrate the first wafer-scale analysis of the impact of undercut trench geometry on device performance using comprehensive wafer-scale measurements across 64 reticles of a 300 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. These results highlight the effectiveness of this wafer-scale thermal undercut technique in minimizing energy consumption, paving the way for scalable, ultra low-power silicon photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Degeneracy Induced by Twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, twisting has emerged as a new degree of freedom that plays an increasingly important role in Bloch bands of various physical systems. However, there is currently a lack of reports on the non-trivial physics of topological degeneracy in twisted systems. In this work, we investigated the intrinsic physical correlation between twisting and topological degeneracy. We found that twisting not only breaks the symmetry of the system but also introduces topological degeneracy that does not exist under the original symmetric system without twisting. Furthermore, the topological degeneracy can be easily tuned through twisting. This new twist-induced topological degeneracy gives rise to a unique polarization-degenerate birefringent medium, wherein the twist angle acts as a novel degree of freedom for dispersion and polarization management of interface states. Exhibiting fascinating properties and experimental feasibilities, our work points to new possibilities in the research of various topological physics in twisted photonics.</description>

      <title>Scalable manufacturing of polarization-insensitive metalenses with high-uniform focal arrays in the visible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-foci metalenses with uniform focal arrays attract special attention as they enable a single incident beam to focus on the same focal plane and share the identical numerical apertures. In this work, we demonstrate the scalable manufacturing of polarization-insensitive metalenses with high-uniform focal arrays in the visible. To overcome the limitations inherent in conventional imprint resins characterized by a low refractive index, hybrid meta-atoms are formed using the imprint resin itself, and a thin layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is deposited on it via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to increase the effective refractive index, enabling full phase coverage. We propose the gradient-descent-optimization strategy for phase retrieval of multi-foci metalens, which renders our design free from cross-talk and makes it feasible to achieve uniform focal arrays with flexible geometries. Based on this inverse-design scheme, the capability of nanoimprinted metalenses are explored by directly producing various focal arrays, including complex geometries such as square, rhombic lattices, as well as intact and defective rings. We envision this work may pave the way for various fields, including optical trapping, materials science, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Two-membrane etalon</title>

Abstract: Optomechanics with semi-transparent membrane multi-oscillators in a high-finesse cavity is an established solution for designing the dispersive interaction, and reaching many achievements, such as the study of non-linear dynamics, heat transfer, and so on. The multi-oscillators are dielectric slabs, usually with low reflectivity, constituting an etalon. Here we propose the theoretical and experimental investigation of a low-finesse optical cavity formed by two (nominally identical) parallel semi-transparent membranes. The experiment consists in laser-driving the cavity, detecting interferometrically the field reflected by the etalon, and measuring the intensity of the transmitted field, for different distances within the two membranes. A complete characterization of the membrane sandwich is provided. On the other hand, we developed an analytical model to describe the fields, which reproduces all the experimental results, under specific approximations. As expected, the model reproduces the known results when high-reflectivity, and/or fixed mirrors conditions are restored. This work paves the way for a complete and analytical model to describe multi-oscillators "membrane-in-the-middle" optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Modelling lined rock caverns subject to hydrogen embrittlement and cyclic pressurisation in fractured rock masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technology of lined rock cavern (LRC) with great geographical flexibility is a promising, cost-effective solution to underground hydrogen storage. However, the air-tight steel tanks used in this technology are susceptible to material degradation due to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), potentially leading to leakage and structural failure, especial for LRCs constructed in complex geological conditions. In this paper, we develop a 2D multiscale numerical model based on the finite element method to assess the impact of HE on the LRC performance in fractured rock masses under cyclic gas pressurisation. Within this framework, a large-scale model is used to simulate the deformation and damage evolution of both fractured rock and an LRC under in-situ stresses and internal gas pressurisation, while a small-scale model captures HE in the steel lining of the LRC. Our simulations reveal that damage in the rock, concrete, and steel degradation is strongly affected by pre-existing fractures and in-situ stresses. Our results also reveal the presence of a strong positive feedback between hydrogen concentration and stress redistribution in the steel lining. Moreover, a comparison between models with and without considering HE illuminates that hydrogen concentration significantly contributes to steel degradation, particularly during the long-term LRC operation, highlighting the critical role of HE in the safety and performance of the LRC. The findings and insights obtained from our work have important implications for the design optimisation and performance assessment of LRCs for sustainable underground hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Electro-mechanically tunable, waveguide-coupled photonic-crystal cavities with embedded quantum dots</title>

Abstract: On-chip micro-cavities with embedded quantum emitters provide an excellent platform for high-performance quantum technologies. A major difficulty for such devices is overcoming the detrimental effects of fluctuations in the device dimensions caused by the limitations of the fabrication processes. We present a fully tunable system based on a 1D photonic-crystal cavity with an embedded quantum dot, which enables tuning of both the quantum dot emission energy and the cavity mode wavelength. A micro-electromechanical cantilever is used to tune the cavity mode wavelength via index modulation and the quantum-confined Stark effect is used to tune the quantum dot emission energy, mitigating the effect of fabrication imperfections. To demonstrate the operation of the device, a maximum, voltage-controllable cavity tuning range of $\Delta \lambda = 1.8$ nm is observed. This signal is measured at the end of a bus waveguide which side-couples to the cavity, enabling the coupling of multiple cavities to a common waveguide, a key requirement for scale-up in these systems. Additionally, a quantum dot is tuned into resonance with the cavity mode, exhibiting an enhanced emission rate with a resolution limited Purcell factor of $F_P = 3.5$.</description>

      <title>Extremal micropolar materials for elastic wave cloaking</title>

Abstract: The asymmetric transformation elasticity offers a promising method to control elastic waves. However, this method requires elastic materials that support asymmetric stresses, which is not objective within the Cauchy elasticity framework. Nevertheless, asymmetric stress tensor is a typical feature of micropolar continuum theory. Yet, possible connection between micropolar continuum theory and the asymmetric elasticity transformation has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that extremal micropolar media, which refer to micropolar media with easy deformation modes, can be used to design elastic cloaks following the asymmetric transformation method. A metamaterial model is proposed to achieve the required extremal micropolar parameters for cloaking. We further design a two-dimensional metamaterial cloak and verify its cloaking performance numerically. An excellent agreement between the metamaterial cloak simulation and an effective-medium calculation is obtained. This study unveils a novel strategy for controlling elastic waves through micropolar media and also sheds light on interesting properties of extremal micropolar materials.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Controlled Magnetoelectric Devices for Neuromorphic Diffusion Process</title>

Abstract: Stochastic diffusion processes are pervasive in nature, from the seemingly erratic Brownian motion to the complex interactions of synaptically-coupled spiking neurons. Recently, drawing inspiration from Langevin dynamics, neuromorphic diffusion models were proposed and have become one of the major breakthroughs in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models as well as other generative models such as ChatGPT aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today's technologies, creating a bottleneck in their efficiency, and impeding further development. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Frechet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~10^3 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.</description>
