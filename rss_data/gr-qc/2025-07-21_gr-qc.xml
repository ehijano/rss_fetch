      <title>Exploring the dynamics of coincident f(Q) gravity in the presence of DBI-essence scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theoretical cosmology, symmetric teleparallel gravity or $f(Q)$ gravity based on nonmetricity tensor Q has become an interesting alternative to General relativity in recent years. The present research paper contains a rigorous dynamical system analysis of coincident f (Q) gravity in the presence of a generalized DBI essence scalar field. We have considered two different models of coincident f(Q) gravity, such as power law model $f(Q) = Q + nQ^m$ and exponential model $f(Q) = Q e^{\frac{\beta Q_0}{Q}}$ respectively, where n, m, \b{eta} are constant parameter and Q is the nonmetricity component. In this study, the generalized DBI essence scalar field acts as an additional dark energy component. After obtaining the field equation for the corresponding cosmological model, we employed several dynamical variables to form the dynamical system. The critical points of these dynamical systems are influenced by cosmological parameters and associated with particular epochs in the cosmological timeline. For different combinations of cosmological parameters, the critical points exhibit different cosmological eras, starting from the accelerated stiff matter era to late-time acceleration phenomena. The stability criteria of each critical point are studied by using linear stability theory, and the physical constraints on the cosmological parameters are also considered during this analysis. Furthermore, the current values of energy densities, deceleration parameters, and equation of state parameters obtained from the evolution diagram are compatible with observational data.</description>

      <title>Functional inference on deviations from General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensions of general relativity often predict modifications to gravitational waveform morphology that depend functionally on source parameters, such as the masses and spins of coalescing black holes. However, current analyses of strong-field gravity lack robust, data-driven methods to infer such functional dependencies. In this work, we introduce GRANITA, a non-perturbative, theory-agnostic framework to characterize parameter-dependent deviations from general relativity using Gaussian process regression. Leveraging the flexibility of this method, we analyze both simulated data and real events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA public catalog. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect and quantify waveform deviations across the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the method can identify stochastic (non-deterministic) deviations, potentially arising from environmental effects or subdominant unmodeled physics. As gravitational-wave tests of strong gravity advance in precision, our framework provides a principled approach to constrain modified gravity and to mitigate contamination from astrophysical or instrumental systematics.</description>

      <title>Chameleon Gravity as an Alternative to Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By studying the chameleon gravity on galaxy scales, we investigate the effects of the chameleon dark matter. To perform this task, we consider the dynamics of the chameleon scalar field in the region of galactic halos in static spherically symmetric spacetimes that differ only slightly from classical general relativity, but have similar symmetry behind this region. Hence, we demonstrate its ability to act as dark matter. In fact, by obtaining the expression for the tangential speed in this region, we apply this approach to explain the issue of flat galactic rotation curves. We obtain that the mass associated with the chameleon scalar field varies linearly with the radius of galaxy, and hence, the tangential speed in that region is constant, which is consistent with observational data without any need to introduce a mysterious dark matter. Accordingly, we show that the presented chameleon gravity has a well-defined Newtonian limit and can describe the geometry of spacetime in the region of flat galactic rotation curves, and is consistent with the corresponding results of the $ \Lambda CDM $ model with the NFW profile. We also consider a test particle moving in a timelike geodesic and obtain the fifth-force, which varies proportionally to the inverse of the radius of galaxy. Moreover, we obtain the effects on the angle representing the deflection of light and on the time representing the radar echo delay of photons passing through the region of galactic halos. We show that as the radius of galaxy increases, the effect on the angle of light passing through the region around galactic halos decreases. Also, the obtained result indicates that the relevant time delay decreases with increasing radius towards the end of the galactic halo.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of a Massive Scalar Field in Slowly Rotating Einstein-Bumblebee Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the impacts of black hole spin, Lorentz-violating parameter, and the scalar field's mass on quasinormal modes (QNMs) of rotating Einstein-Bumblebee black holes, including computations up to the second-order expansion in rotation parameters. We investigate two classes of Lorentz-violating rotating black holes: one constructed via the Newman-Janis algorithm and the other obtained by solving the field equations through a series expansion. Within the slow-rotation approximation framework, we derive the master equations governing a massive scalar field and compute the corresponding QNM frequencies numerically using both the continued fraction method and the matrix method. The numerical results indicate that the QNM frequencies exhibit increased sensitivity to negative $\ell$ variations, which reduces the influence of the field mass parameter $\tilde{\mu}$. Meanwhile, the spectral "cube" of NJA black holes shows slight compression for $m&gt;0$ with $ \ell&gt;0 $ and expansion for $m&lt;0$ with $ \ell&gt;0 $ compared to another black holes, where $m$ is approximately proportional to the spin parameter at first order, while richer structures and lifted degeneracy emerge at second order.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the Accretion Disk Formed in Prompt Collapse Mergers with Future Gravitational-Wave Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production site of heavy r-process elements, such as Gold and Uranium, is uncertain. Neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical phenomenon in which we have witnessed their formation. However, the amount of heavy elements resulting from the merger remains poorly constrained, mainly due to uncertainties on the mass and angular momentum of the disk formed in the merger remnant. Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to \emph{directly} measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10\% for binaries at a distance of up to 30~Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year.</description>

      <title>Apparent Horizons Associated with Dynamical Black Hole Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define entropic marginally outer trapped surfaces (E-MOTSs) as a generalization of apparent horizons. We then show that, under first-order perturbations around a stationary black hole, the dynamical black hole entropy proposed by Hollands, Wald, and Zhang, defined on a background Killing horizon, can be expressed as the Wall entropy evaluated on an E-MOTS associated with it. Our result ensures that the Hollands-Wald-Zhang entropy reduces to the standard Wald entropy in each stationary regime of a dynamical black hole, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the dynamical entropy formulation.</description>

      <title>Challenges for describing unitary evolution in nontrivial geometries: pictures and representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Description of evolution between spatial slices in a general spacetime suffers from a significant difficulty: the states on the slices, in a given basis, are not related by a unitary transformation. This problem, which occurs in spacetime dimensions above two, is directly related to the infinite number of inequivalent representations of the canonical commutators, and in particular will arise for interacting theories in time-dependent spacetimes. We connect different facets of this issue, and discuss its possible resolution. It is directly related to discussions of failure of a standard Schr\"odinger picture of evolution, and of evolution via "many-fingered time." One requires a condition specifying a physical unitary equivalence class of states; in general this equivalence class evolves with time, and an important question is how it is determined. One approach to this in free theories is by imposing a Hadamard condition on the two point function. We explore a different approach, which also may be helpful for interacting theories, analyzing the structure of the state in a local limit, and relate these approaches. We also elucidate the non-Hadamard behavior of unphysical vacua, and discuss concrete examples of these approaches involving cosmological and black hole evolution. The issues are extended in the context of quantum dynamical geometry, and raise important questions for the proper description of the wavefunction of the universe and for the role of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\pm 0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10$\% and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\pm 0.006$, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the galaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in pure dephasing relativistic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) unlike the bipartite case where it is possible to generate close to maximally entangled states via the spin-boson interactions, the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement is non-perturbatively hard even at sufficiently long times. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Environmental Monitoring, and Newtonian Noise Mitigation:Comparable Sensitivity to Seismometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Retrograde Precession in Misaligned Black Hole Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 years of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.</description>

Abstract: According to usual calculations in quantum field theory, both in flat and curved spacetime, the mass $m^2$ of a scalar particle is quadratically sensitive to the ultimate scale of the theory, the UV physical cutoff $\Lambda$. In the present work, paying attention to the path integral measure and to the way $\Lambda$ is introduced, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}$ for a scalar field on a non-trivial gravitational background. We find that $m^2$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda$. This is obtained without resorting to a supersymmetric embedding of the theory, nor to regularization schemes (as dimensional or zeta-function regularization) where power-like divergences are absent by construction. In view of the results of the present work, we finally speculate on the way the Minkowski limit should be approached.</description>

      <title>Investigating $f(R)$-Inflation: background evolution and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility of generating an inflationary mechanism within the framework of a metric-$f(R)$ modified gravity theory, formulated in the Jordan frame. We explore whether the scalar field, non-minimally coupled to gravity and emerging in the Jordan frame, can play the role of the primordial inflaton. Particular attention is devoted to constructing a dynamical scenario in the Jordan frame that exhibits a slow-rolling phase for the scalar field and admits a quasi-de Sitter solution for cosmic evolution. To ensure consistency with the standard cosmological model, we impose a matching condition with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the end of the inflationary phase. Furthermore, to address the problem of the absence of matter after inflation, we consider a radiation-type particle creation process that maintains an approximately constant energy density. We test our theoretical model against background observational data, specifically Pantheon+ calibrated with SH0ES and DESI calibrated with BBN. We asses its viability and discuss implications for alleviating the Hubble constant tension.</description>

      <title>Robustness of analogue Hawking radiation in cavities with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the limitations and robustness of thermal radiation in dynamical Casimir systems serving as analogs for Hawking radiation. Through detailed numerical analysis, we characterize particle production spectra in cavities with moving boundaries under various configurations, including expanding, collapsing, and rigidly accelerating scenarios. We find that thermal signatures emerge in specific expanding cavity configurations but are highly dependent on frequency bands and acceleration parameters. In those configurations of the cavity where there is thermal production, we derive fitting expressions that quantify deviations from idealized thermal spectra through gray-body factors, revealing oscillatory behaviors tied to acceleration duration. Our results identify which experimental setups can reliably simulate gravitationally-induced phenomena and quantify how finite-size effects and transient dynamics modify the expected thermal distributions, providing a comprehensive framework for distinguishing genuine Hawking-like radiation from experimental artifacts.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalization and running of galaxy bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically extend the framework of galaxy bias renormalization to two-loop order. For the minimal complete basis of 29 deterministic bias operators up to fifth order in the density field and at leading order in gradient expansion we explicitly work out one- and two-loop renormalization. The latter is provided in terms of double-hard limits of bias kernels, which we find to depend on only one function of the ratio of the loop momenta. After including stochasticity in terms of composite operator renormalization, we apply the framework to the two-loop power spectrum of biased tracers and provide a simple result suitable for numerical evaluation. In addition, we work out one- and two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for deterministic bias coefficients related to bias operators constructed from a smoothed density field, generalizing previous works. We identify a linear combination of bias operators with enhanced UV sensitivity, related to a positive eigenvalue of the RGE. Finally, we present an analogy with the RGE as used in quantum field theory, suggesting that a resummation of large logarithms as employed in the latter may also yield useful applications in the study of large-scale galaxy bias.</description>

      <title>Gravity MHV amplitudes via Berends-Giele currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berends and Giele derived the Parke-Taylor formula for Yang-Mills MHV amplitudes by computing Berends-Giele currents involving gluons of all-plus and all-but-one-plus helicities. Remarkably, the all-plus current already encodes much of the Parke-Taylor formula structure. The all-but-one-plus current satisfies a more intricate recursion relation than the all-plus case, but one that can still be solved explicitly. This current turns out to be proportional to the all-plus current, which explains why the essential features of the MHV formula are already present at the all-plus level.
  In this paper, we carry out an analogous program for gravity. The all-plus graviton Berends-Giele current satisfies a recursion relation that is more involved than in the Yang-Mills case, but whose explicit solution is known: a sum over spanning trees of the complete graph on n vertices. We derive and solve the recursion relation for the all-but-one-plus graviton current. The solution is again given by a sum over spanning trees, where each tree contributes a term proportional to the corresponding all-plus current, multiplied by a factor given by a sum over subtrees. Only a small subset of these terms contributes to the MHV amplitude, which we recover explicitly. This provides a direct derivation of the gravity MHV formula from the gravitational Feynman rules - achieving what Berends, Giele, and Kuijf in their 1987 paper regarded as "hard to obtain directly from quantum gravity".</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing by black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity's Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing in the strong-field regime for a black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity with Rainbow gravity modifications. This black hole spacetime is characterized by the Euler Heisenberg parameter, F(R) parameters, Rainbow functions, the black hole charge Q, and mass M . We numerically compute the strong deflection angle and its associated coefficients, and explore their astrophysical implications for supermassive black holes in different galaxies. Our findings show that increasing the Euler Heisenberg parameter enhances key lensing observables such as the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, angular position, relative magnification, Einstein ring radius, and time delay for a fixed Q . Conversely, increasing Q decreases these parameters while keeping other quantities fixed. Additionally, a higher Euler Heisenberg parameter reduces the deflection angle and angular separation S , whereas increasing Q causes both to increase. Our study reveals that black holes in this modified gravity framework can act as strong gravitational lenses, producing deflection angles that surpass those of Reissner Nordstrom and Schwarzschild black holes under specific conditions. These results highlight the unique topological features of modified charged black holes and suggest their potential as astrophysical candidates, offering new insights into their observational signatures. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the lensing predictions with respect to changes in the functional forms of the Rainbow functions. The combined effects of F(R) gravity, Euler Heisenberg electrodynamics, and Rainbow gravity introduce novel qualitative features not present in the individual models.</description>

      <title>Testing Signatures of Phantom Crossing through Full-Shape Galaxy Clustering Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$--$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Two dynamical scenarios for the binned Master sample interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze two different scenarios for the late Universe dynamics, resulting into Hubble parameters deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM, mainly for the presence of an additional free parameter, which is the dark energy parameter. The first model consists of a pure evolutionary dark energy paradigm, as result of its creation by the gravitational field of the expanding Universe. The second model also considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter component, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal energy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \textit{via} the diagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data of the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison procedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of data for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a phantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being left free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce the decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant, already discussed in literature.</description>

      <title>A spherical hydrodynamical model of cosmic voids in {\Lambda}CDM and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.
  Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.</description>

      <title>On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics. Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries, namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN) approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application, we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally, we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.</description>

Abstract: Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror in (1+3)-dimensional flat spacetime is investigated. This is accomplished by studying the reflected frequency and momentum based on Einstein's mirror, instead of the canonical way of solving, if possible, wave equations subjected to a dynamical Dirichlet boundary condition. In the case of a finite-size mirror, diffraction pattern appears in the radiation spectrum. Based on the relevant parameters in the proposed Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers experiment, in which the Hawking temperature $T_{H}\simeq 0.03$ eV and the mirror area $\mathcal{A}\simeq (50\;\mu\mathrm{m})^{2}$, the Hawking photon yield is estimated to be $N\simeq 16$/laser shot.</description>

Abstract: We conduct two searches for continuous, nearly monochromatic gravitational waves originating from the central compact objects in the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A and Vela Jr. using public LIGO data. The search for Cassiopeia A targets signal frequencies between 20 Hz and 400 Hz; the Vela Jr. search between 400 Hz and 1700 Hz, and both investigate the broadest set of waveforms ever considered with highly sensitive deterministic search methods. Above 1500 Hz the Vela Jr. search is the most sensitive carried out thus far, improving on previous results by over 300\%. Above 976 Hz these results improve on existing ones by 50\%. In all we investigate over $10^{18}$ waveforms, leveraging the computational power donated by thousands of Einstein@Home volunteers. We perform a 4-stage follow-up on more than 6 million waveforms. None of the considered waveforms survives the follow-up scrutiny, indicating no significate detection candidate. Our null results constrain the maximum amplitude of continuous signals as a function of signal frequency from the targets. The most stringent 90\% confidence upper limit for Cas A is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 7.3\times10^{-26}$ near 200 Hz, and for Vela Jr. it is $h_0^{90 \%}\approx 8.9\times10^{-26}$ near 400 Hz. Translated into upper limits on the ellipticity and r-mode amplitude, our results probe physically interesting regions: for example the ellipticity of Vela Jr. is constrained to be smaller than $10^{-7}$ across the frequency band, with a tighter constraint of less than $2\times10^{-8}$ at the highest frequencies.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced entanglement at finite temperature: A memory-driven time-crystalline phase?</title>

Abstract: We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Sky localization and polarization mode reconstruction of gravitational waves from GW170104 and GW150914</title>

Abstract: The detections\citep{KAGRA:2023pio,LIGOScientific:2019lzm} and analysis of gravitational waves(GWs) have introduced us in a new era of our understanding of the cosmos, providing new insights into astrophysical systems involving massive objects as black holes and neutron stars. Normally the precise sky localization of a GW source needs data from three or more observatories\citep{LIGOScientific:2016lio,Abbott:2017oio}. However, the results presented in this article demonstrate that it is in fact possible to obtain the position of a GW source in a small region of the celestial sphere using data from just two GW observatories, in this case LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston. Furthermore, we are also able to reconstruct the gravitational-wave polarization\citep{Poisson2014} modes(PMs) for the GW170104\citep{Abbott:2017vtc} and GW150914\citep{TheLIGOScientific:2016qqj} events, with data from only these two detectors. The procedure only uses the spin 2 properties of the GW, so that it does not rely on specific assumptions on the nature of the source. Our findings are possible through careful data filtering methods\citep{Moreschi:2019vxw}, the use of refined signal processing algorithms\citep{Moreschi:2024njx}, and the application of dedicated denoising\citep{Mallat2009} techniques. This progress in the GW studies represents the first instance of a direct measurement of PMs using such a limited observational data. We provide detailed validation through the reconstruction of PMs for different polarization angles, and calculations of residuals for the GW170104 event. We also test the procedure with synthetic data with ten different source locations and polarization angles.</description>

      <title>Topology of circular orbits for charged particles in black holes with multiple horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the topological properties of circular orbits is opening up new perspectives for exploring the spacetime structure around black holes. In this work, we investigate how the charged properties of particles affect the topological characteristics of circular orbits for charged test particles in asymptotically flat, AdS, and dS black holes. Our findings demonstrate that the charged properties not only influence the topological properties of timelike circular orbits but also impact those of null circular orbits. Additionally, we explore scenarios involving multiple horizons and find that for a multi-horizon black hole, if a circular orbit can exist between two neighboring horizons, there will always be at least one unstable null circular orbit and one unstable timelike circular orbit.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle-Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations of detector trajectories. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a fermionic thermal bath. We demonstrate that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have similar behaviour to those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. We further consider a different interaction Hamiltonian which breaks local Lorentz symmetry and find that the transition rate of the static detector still exhibits Planckian behavior in the HHI state, while in the Unruh state, it leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein in interaction, respectively. We observe that the anti-Hawking effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation decrease it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case of the scalar field. Conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>A generic dynamical system formulation for Bianchi-I cosmology with isotropic fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a generic dynamical system formulation for Bianchi-I cosmology in the presence of an isotropic fluid within the coincident gauge connection branch and one of the non-coincident gauge connection branches of $f(Q)$ gravity theory. For both the connection branches under consideration, we start from the generic Bianchi-I cosmological field equations in $f(Q)$ and present a prescription of how one can construct an autonomous dynamical system in terms of the standard Hubble-normalized dimensionless dynamical variables once an $f(Q)$ theory is provided. Particular care has been taken to single out the physically viable regions in the phase space for each of the models under consideration. This results in the finding that, for both of the connection branches under consideration, the Kasner solution marginally violates the key physical viability condition of positive effective gravitational coupling ($f_Q&gt;0$) for all the models considered, whereas a physically viable de-Sitter future attractor appears in all the models, except for the very special case of the monomial model within the coincident gauge connection. In the context of the early universe cosmology, we find that isotropization of a homogeneously perturbed inflating FLRW universe is a generic model-independent feature in the coincident gauge, whereas the isotropization of a homogeneously perturbed pre-bounce ekpyrotically contracting FLRW universe is, although not completely generic, but a likely scenario.</description>

      <title>Constraining superluminal Einstein-\AE{}ther gravity through gravitational memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every emission of radiation in gravity also includes a nonwavelike component that leaves a permanent change in proper distances of the spacetime it travels through. This phenomenon is known as gravitational displacement memory. Building up on a recently developed computation framework that harnesses Isaacson's insights on a fundamental definition of gravitational waves, we compute the leading displacement memory formula in Einstein-Aether gravity. Our analysis represents the first direct calculation of gravitational memory in a metric theory with nontrivial asymptotic vector field value. We find that an emission of scalar and vector aether waves at a propagation speed greater than the speed of tensor radiation features unprotected causal directions with a priori unbound memory build-up. Based on the results and the existing constraint of luminally propagating tensor waves, we conjecture a stringent exclusion of the superluminal parameter space of Einstein-Aether gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference in terrestrial laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate how Earth's gravitational field affects Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference experiments conducted in a terrestrial laboratory. To second order, we calculate the relativistic time delay from the null geodesic equation (particle perspective), while the phase shift and the associated effective time delay are derived from the Klein-Gordon equation (wave perspective). Since gravity influences both the temporal and spatial parts of the phase shift, these two time delays differ and lead to different coincidence probabilities. The previous HOM experiment conducted on a rotating platform suggests that the wave perspective can explain the experimental results. We further explore the frame dragging and redshift effects in an arbitrarily oriented rectangular interferometer under two distinct scenarios with different photon paths, measuring one effect in each scenario. We find that both effects can be amplified by increasing the number of light loops. Additionally, we emphasize that the next-to-leading order Sagnac effect, arising from gravitational acceleration, is comparable to the Thomas precession, the geodetic effect, and the Lense-Thirring effect. To detect the leading order Sagnac effect and the redshift effect caused by gravitational acceleration, we estimate the number of loops that photons should travel in the interferometer. Furthermore, we propose that the difference between two HOM patterns can be used as a probe to detect gravitational effects on quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Penrose process in magnetized non-Kerr rotating spacetime with anomalous quadrupole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic Penrose process in the Quevedo-Mashhoon spacetime, immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$. This metric is a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat vacuum solution to Einstein's equations with an arbitrary anomalous quadrupole moment ${\cal Q}$. A non-vanishing ${\cal Q}$ significantly modifies the near-horizon geometry, creating a multi-lobe ergoregion. Both ${\cal Q}$ and $B$ strongly influence the negative-energy region, which can extend well beyond the ergoregion, enabling the magnetic Penrose process to operate far from the ergoregion. Their combined effects allow energy extraction efficiency $\eta$ to far exceed that of the mechanical Penrose process. The maximum efficiency undergoes three distinct evolutionary stages as ${\cal Q}$ varies. In the absence of the magnetic field, efficiency is optimized for more negative ${\cal Q}$ (yielding a more oblate spacetime than Kerr). When electromagnetic interactions dominate, efficiency peaks when the infalling fragment's charge and $B$ share the same sign and ${\cal Q}$ is more positive (producing a more prolate spacetime than Kerr). These findings support the magnetic Penrose process as a theoretical framework for high-energy cosmic phenomena (e.g., extragalactic high-energy radiation) and as a tool to test the Kerr hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Modular Fluctuations in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verlinde and Zurek (VZ) have proposed that quantum gravity fluctuations in causal diamonds lead to observable effects. In particular, they argued that in quantum gravity causal diamonds have an uncertainty in their size that scales as $\delta L \sim \sqrt{\ell_p L}$, i.e. fluctuations are enhanced from the Planck scale. In this work, we explore the origin of the VZ scaling by studying scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmology. We reinterpret these cosmological perturbations as fluctuations of the modular Hamiltonian associated with a causal diamond, establishing a connection between modular fluctuations and observable primordial perturbations. Independent of assumptions about the modular Hamiltonian or the background spacetime, our results show that -- whenever an (effective) spherically symmetric perturbation is quantized -- it can lead to the VZ scaling. However, whether such a mode exists in the vacuum of any theory of quantum gravity remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Strict renormalizability as a paradigm for fundamental physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important theoretical achievement of the last century was the realization that strict renormalizability can be a powerful criterion to select Lagrangians in the framework of perturbative quantum field theory. The Standard Model Lagrangian (without gravity) is strictly renormalizable from a perturbative point of view. On the other hand, the inclusion of gravity seems not to respect this criterion, since general relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable. The aim of this work is to provide concrete evidence that strict renormalizability is still a valid criterion even when applied to gravity. First, we show that adding quadratic curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action gives rise to a strictly renormalizable theory known as quadratic gravity. Second, we argue that this unique theory represents the most conservative approach to quantum gravity and, at the same time, is highly predictive, as it can explain new physics beyond general relativity already in the sub-Planckian regime. In particular, it provides one of the best fits to the CMB anisotropies via Starobinsky inflation and makes sharp cosmological predictions that can be tested in the near future. Finally, we comment on the (super-)Planckian regime and conclude with a historical note.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from a curvaton: the role of bimodal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes in curvaton models of inflation, where the curvature perturbation is not only generated by the inflaton but also by a light scalar field (the curvaton) that decays after inflation. During inflation, both fields are subject to quantum diffusion, owing to small-scale vacuum fluctuations crossing out the Hubble radius. After inflation, whether the curvaton dominates the universe or not depends on its field value when inflation ends. Since that value is stochastic, different regions of the universe undergo different post-inflationary histories. In practice, we show that this results in a double-peaked distribution for the number of e-folds realised in these models. Since that number of e-folds is related to the curvature perturbation by the delta-N formalism, the presence of a second peak has important consequences for primordial black holes that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>
