      <title>Dynamical regimes of CCN activation in adiabatic air parcels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ubiquitous, yet elusive to a complete understanding: Tiny, warm clouds with faint visual signatures play a critical role in Earth's energy balance. These "twilight clouds", as they are sometimes called, form under weak updraft conditions. Their constituent particles exist in a precarious state, teetering between hazy wisps and activated droplets. This delicate thermodynamic balance creates a limited reservoir of supersaturation, which activated droplets readily consume. Our research presents a novel approach, solving coupled equations for particle growth (K\"ohler's equation) and supersaturation change. This reveals previously unconsidered activation states for these clouds. Additionally, the analysis predicts conditions where particles can exhibit self-sustained oscillations between haze and activated droplet states.</description>

      <title>Application of Tensorized Neural Networks for Cloud Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained widespread usage across various fields such as weather forecasting, computer vision, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis due to its exceptional ability to extract spatial information, share parameters, and learn local features. However, the practical implementation and commercialization of CNNs in these domains are hindered by challenges related to model sizes, overfitting, and computational time. To address these limitations, our study proposes a groundbreaking approach that involves tensorizing the dense layers in the CNN to reduce model size and computational time. Additionally, we incorporate attention layers into the CNN and train it using Contrastive self-supervised learning to effectively classify cloud information, which is crucial for accurate weather forecasting. We elucidate the key characteristics of tensorized neural network (TNN), including the data compression rate, accuracy, and computational speed. The results indicate how TNN change their properties under the batch size setting.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Decomposition: a Nonlinear Eigenspace Decomposition for a Moist Atmosphere with Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear decomposition of states underpins many classical systems. This is the case of the Helmholtz decomposition, used to split vector fields into divergence-free and potential components, and of the dry Boussinesq system in atmospheric dynamics, where identifying the slow and fast components of the flow can be viewed as a decomposition. The dry Boussinesq system incorporates two leading ingredients of mid-latitude atmospheric motion: rotation and stratification. In both cases the leading order dynamics are linear so we can rely on an eigendecomposition to decompose states.
  Here we study the extension of dry Boussinesq to incorporate another important ingredient in the atmosphere: moisture and clouds. The key challenge with this system is that nonlinearities are present at leading order due to phase boundaries at cloud edge. Therefore standard tools of linear algebra, relying on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, are not applicable. The question we address in this paper is this: in spite of the nonlinearities, can we find a decomposition for this moist Boussinesq system?
  We identify such a decomposition adapted to the nonlinear balances arising from water phase boundaries. This decomposition combines perspectives from partial differential equations (PDEs), the geometry, and the conserved energy. Moreover it sheds light on two aspects of previous work. First, this decomposition shows that the nonlinear elliptic PDE used for potential vorticity and moisture inversion can be used outside the limiting system where it was first derived. Second, we are able to rigorously justify, and interpret geometrically, an existing numerical method for this elliptic PDE. This decomposition may be important in applications because, like its linear counterparts, it may be used to analyze observational data. Moreover, by contrast with previous decompositions, it may be used even in the presence of clouds.</description>

      <title>Formulation and evaluation of ocean dynamics problems as optimization problems for quantum annealing machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing suggest the potential to revolutionize computational algorithms across various scientific domains including oceanography and atmospheric science. The field is still relatively young and quantum computation is so different from classical computation that suitable frameworks to represent oceanic and atmospheric dynamics are yet to be explored. Quantum annealing, one of the major paradigms, focuses on combinatorial optimization tasks. In this paper, we solve the classical Stommel problem by quantum annealing (QA) and simulated annealing (SA), a classical counterpart of quantum annealing. We cast the linear partial differential equation into an optimization problem by the least-squares method and discretize the cost function in two ways: finite difference and truncated basis expansion. In either case, SA successfully reproduces the expected solution when appropriate parameters are chosen, demonstrating that annealing has the potential. In contrast, QA using the D-Wave quantum annealing machine fails to obtain good solutions for some cases owing to hardware limitations; in particular, the highly limited connectivity graph of the machine limits the size of the solvable problems, at least under currently available algorithms. Either expanding the connectivity graph or improving the graph embedding algorithms would probably be necessary for quantum annealing machines to be usable for oceanic and atmospheric dynamics problems. While this finding emphasizes the need for hardware improvements and enhancements in graph embedding algorithms for practical applications of quantum annealers, the results from simulated annealing suggest its potential to address practical geophysical dynamics problems. As quantum calculation continues to evolve, addressing these challenges may lead to transformative advancements in ocean and atmosphere modeling.</description>

      <title>Alternators For Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. When alternators are used as generative models, the FTN produces interpretable low-dimensional latent variables that capture the dynamics governing the observations. When alternators are used as sequence-to-sequence predictors, the FTN learns to predict the observed features. In both cases, the OTN learns to produce sequences that match the data. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and outperform strong baselines such as neural ODEs and diffusion models in the domains we studied.</description>

      <title>FengWu-4DVar: Coupling the Data-driven Weather Forecasting Model with 4D Variational Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a crucial yet highly challenging task. With the maturity of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the emergence of data-driven weather forecasting models has opened up a new paradigm for the development of weather forecasting systems. Despite the significant successes that have been achieved (e.g., surpassing advanced traditional physical models for global medium-range forecasting), existing data-driven weather forecasting models still rely on the analysis fields generated by the traditional assimilation and forecasting system, which hampers the significance of data-driven weather forecasting models regarding both computational cost and forecasting accuracy. In this work, we explore the possibility of coupling the data-driven weather forecasting model with data assimilation by integrating the global AI weather forecasting model, FengWu, with one of the most popular assimilation algorithms, Four-Dimensional Variational (4DVar) assimilation, and develop an AI-based cyclic weather forecasting system, FengWu-4DVar. FengWu-4DVar can incorporate observational data into the data-driven weather forecasting model and consider the temporal evolution of atmospheric dynamics to obtain accurate analysis fields for making predictions in a cycling manner without the help of physical models. Owning to the auto-differentiation ability of deep learning models, FengWu-4DVar eliminates the need of developing the cumbersome adjoint model, which is usually required in the traditional implementation of the 4DVar algorithm. Experiments on the simulated observational dataset demonstrate that FengWu-4DVar is capable of generating reasonable analysis fields for making accurate and efficient iterative predictions.</description>

      <title>Non-equivalence of quasilinear dynamical systems and their statistical closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely believed that statistical closure theories for dynamical systems provide statistics equivalent to those of the governing dynamical equations from which the former are derived. Here, we demonstrate counterexamples in the context of the widely used mean-field quasilinear (QL) approximation applied to 2D fluid dynamical systems. We compare statistics of QL numerical simulations with those obtained by direct statistical simulation via a cumulant expansion closed at second order (CE2). We observe that, though CE2 is an exact statistical closure for QL dynamics, its predictions disagree with the statistics of the QL solution for identical parameter values. These disagreements are attributed to instabilities, which we term rank instabilities, of the second cumulant dynamics within CE2 that are unavailable in the QL equations.</description>

      <title>A Temporal Stochastic Bias Correction using a Machine Learning Attention model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14169v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate models are biased with respect to real-world observations. They usually need to be adjusted before being used in impact studies. The suite of statistical methods that enable such adjustments is called bias correction (BC). However, BC methods currently struggle to adjust temporal biases. Because they mostly disregard the dependence between consecutive time points. As a result, climate statistics with long-range temporal properties, such as heatwave duration and frequency, cannot be corrected accurately. This makes it more difficult to produce reliable impact studies on such climate statistics. This paper offers a novel BC methodology to correct temporal biases. This is made possible by rethinking the philosophy behind BC. We will introduce BC as a time-indexed regression task with stochastic outputs. Rethinking BC enables us to adapt state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) attention models and thereby learn different types of biases, including temporal asynchronicities. With a case study of heatwave duration statistics in Abuja, Nigeria, and Tokyo, Japan, we show more accurate results than current climate model outputs and alternative BC methods.</description>
