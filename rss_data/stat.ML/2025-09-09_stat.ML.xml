      <title>Cryo-EM as a Stochastic Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) enables high-resolution imaging of biomolecules, but structural heterogeneity remains a major challenge in 3D reconstruction. Traditional methods assume a discrete set of conformations, limiting their ability to recover continuous structural variability. In this work, we formulate cryo-EM reconstruction as a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) over probability measures, where the observed images are modeled as the push-forward of an unknown distribution over molecular structures via a random forward operator. We pose the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a variational discrepancy between observed and simulated image distributions, using statistical distances such as the KL divergence and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The resulting optimization is performed over the space of probability measures via a Wasserstein gradient flow, which we numerically solve using particles to represent and evolve conformational ensembles. We validate our approach using synthetic examples, including a realistic protein model, which demonstrates its ability to recover continuous distributions over structural states. We analyze the connection between our formulation and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approaches, which can be interpreted as instances of the discretize-then-optimize (DTO) framework. We further provide a consistency analysis, establishing conditions under which DTO methods, such as MAP estimation, converge to the solution of the underlying infinite-dimensional continuous problem. Beyond cryo-EM, the framework provides a general methodology for solving SIPs involving random forward operators.</description>

      <title>Robust variational neural posterior estimation for simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (GDP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant problem for their use on real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting tunable hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse Fair Multi-class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new classification framework based on the theory of coherent risk measures and systemic risk. The proposed approach is suitable for multi-class problems when the data is noisy, scarce (relative to the dimension of the problem), and the labeling might be unreliable. In the first part of our paper, we provide the foundation of the use of systemic risk models and show how to apply it in the context of linear and kernel-based multi-class problems. More advanced formulation via a system-theoretic approach with non-linear aggregation is proposed, which leads to a two-stage stochastic programming problem. A risk-averse regularized decomposition method is designed to solve the problem. We use a popular multi-class method as a benchmark in the performance analysis of the proposed classification methods. We illustrate our ideas by proposing several generalization of that method by the use of coherent measures of risk. The viability of the proposed risk-averse methods are supported theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we demonstrate that the application of systemic risk measures facilitates enforcing fairness in classification. Analysis and experiments regarding the fairness of the proposed models are carefully conducted. For all methods, our numerical experiments demonstrate that they are robust in the presence of unreliable training data and perform better on unknown data than the methods minimizing expected classification errors. Furthermore, the performance improves when the number of classes increases.</description>

      <title>Causal Clustering for Conditional Average Treatment Effects Estimation and Subgroup Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is critical in domains such as personalized medicine, resource allocation, and policy evaluation. A central challenge lies in identifying subpopulations that respond differently to interventions, thereby enabling more targeted and effective decision-making. While clustering methods are well-studied in unsupervised learning, their integration with causal inference remains limited. We propose a novel framework that clusters individuals based on estimated treatment effects using a learned kernel derived from causal forests, revealing latent subgroup structures. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we estimate debiased Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) using orthogonalized learners via the Robinson decomposition, yielding a kernel matrix that encodes sample-level similarities in treatment responsiveness. Second, we apply kernelized clustering to this matrix to uncover distinct, treatment-sensitive subpopulations and compute cluster-level average CATEs. We present this kernelized clustering step as a form of regularization within the residual-on-residual regression framework. Through extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, supported by ablation studies and exploratory analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Fisher Random Walk: Automatic Debiasing Contextual Preference Inference for Large Language Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for rigorous and scalable evaluation of large language models, we study contextual preference inference for pairwise comparison functionals of context-dependent preference score functions across domains. Focusing on the contextual Bradley-Terry-Luce model, we develop a semiparametric efficient estimator that automates the debiased estimation through aggregating weighted residual balancing terms across the comparison graph. We show that the efficiency is achieved when the weights are derived from a novel strategy called Fisher random walk. We also propose a computationally feasible method to compute the weights by a potential representation of nuisance weight functions. We show our inference procedure is valid for general score function estimators accommodating the practitioners' need to implement flexible deep learning methods. We extend the procedure to multiple hypothesis testing using a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap that controls familywise error and to distributional shift via a cross-fitted importance-sampling adjustment for target-domain inference. Numerical studies, including language model evaluations under diverse contexts, corroborate the accuracy, efficiency, and practical utility of our method.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Probabilistic Machine Learning Models: Theory, Methods, and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential in probabilistic machine learning models, particularly for assessing the reliability of predictions. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for estimating both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in probabilistic models. We focus on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models and employ scalable Random Fourier Features-based Gaussian Processes to approximate predictive distributions efficiently. We derive a theoretical formulation for UQ, propose a Monte Carlo sampling-based estimation method, and conduct experiments to evaluate the impact of uncertainty estimation. Our results provide insights into the sources of predictive uncertainty and illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying the confidence in the predictions.</description>

      <title>Additive Distributionally Robust Ranking and Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking and selection (R&amp;S) aims to identify the alternative with the best mean performance among $k$ simulated alternatives. The practical value of R&amp;S depends on accurate simulation input modeling, which often suffers from the curse of input uncertainty due to limited data. Distributionally robust ranking and selection (DRR&amp;S) addresses this challenge by modeling input uncertainty via an ambiguity set of $m &gt; 1$ plausible input distributions, resulting in $km$ scenarios in total. Recent DRR&amp;S studies suggest a key structural insight: additivity in budget allocation is essential for efficiency. However, existing justifications are heuristic, and fundamental properties such as consistency and the precise allocation pattern induced by additivity remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a simple additive allocation (AA) procedure that aims to exclusively sample the $k + m - 1$ previously hypothesized critical scenarios. Leveraging boundary-crossing arguments, we establish a lower bound on the probability of correct selection and characterize the procedure's budget allocation behavior. We then prove that AA is consistent and, surprisingly, achieves additivity in the strongest sense: as the total budget increases, only $k + m - 1$ scenarios are sampled infinitely often. Notably, the worst-case scenarios of non-best alternatives may not be among them, challenging prior beliefs about their criticality. These results offer new and counterintuitive insights into the additive structure of DRR&amp;S. To improve practical performance while preserving this structure, we introduce a general additive allocation (GAA) framework that flexibly incorporates sampling rules from traditional R&amp;S procedures in a modular fashion. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed GAA procedures.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Minimax-Optimal Sparsity-Adaptive Inference for Change Points in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new inference framework, named MOSAIC, for change-point detection in dynamic networks with the simultaneous low-rank and sparse-change structure. We establish the minimax rate of detection boundary, which relies on the sparsity of changes. We then develop an eigen-decomposition-based test with screened signals that approaches the minimax rate in theory, with only a minor logarithmic loss. For practical implementation of MOSAIC, we adjust the theoretical test by a novel residual-based technique, resulting in a pivotal statistic that converges to a standard normal distribution via the martingale central limit theorem under the null hypothesis and achieves full power under the alternative hypothesis. We also analyze the minimax rate of testing boundary for dynamic networks without the low-rank structure, which almost aligns with the results in high-dimensional mean-vector change-point inference. We showcase the effectiveness of MOSAIC and verify our theoretical results with several simulation examples and a real data application.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimal transfer learning for high-dimensional additive regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies high-dimensional additive regression under the transfer learning framework, where one observes samples from a target population together with auxiliary samples from different but potentially related regression models. We first introduce a target-only estimation procedure based on the smooth backfitting estimator with local linear smoothing. In contrast to previous work, we establish general error bounds under sub-Weibull($\alpha$) noise, thereby accommodating heavy-tailed error distributions. In the sub-exponential case ($\alpha=1$), we show that the estimator attains the minimax lower bound under regularity conditions, which requires a substantial departure from existing proof strategies. We then develop a novel two-stage estimation method within a transfer learning framework, and provide theoretical guarantees at both the population and empirical levels. Error bounds are derived for each stage under general tail conditions, and we further demonstrate that the minimax optimal rate is achieved when the auxiliary and target distributions are sufficiently close. All theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Robust and Adaptive Spectral Method for Representation Multi-Task Learning with Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation-based multi-task learning (MTL) improves efficiency by learning a shared structure across tasks, but its practical application is often hindered by contamination, outliers, or adversarial tasks. Most existing methods and theories assume a clean or near-clean setting, failing when contamination is significant. This paper tackles representation MTL with an unknown and potentially large contamination proportion, while also allowing for heterogeneity among inlier tasks. We introduce a Robust and Adaptive Spectral method (RAS) that can distill the shared inlier representation effectively and efficiently, while requiring no prior knowledge of the contamination level or the true representation dimension. Theoretically, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds for both the learned representation and the per-task parameters. These bounds adapt to inlier task similarity and outlier structure, and guarantee that RAS performs at least as well as single-task learning, thus preventing negative transfer. We also extend our framework to transfer learning with corresponding theoretical guarantees for the target task. Extensive experiments confirm our theory, showcasing the robustness and adaptivity of RAS, and its superior performance in regimes with up to 80\% task contamination.</description>

      <title>Automated Hierarchical Graph Construction for Multi-source Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comprising diverse clinical data such as diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results, hold great promise for translational research. EHR-derived data have advanced disease prevention, improved clinical trial recruitment, and generated real-world evidence. Synthesizing EHRs across institutions enables large-scale, generalizable studies that capture rare diseases and population diversity, but remains hindered by the heterogeneity of medical codes, institution-specific terminologies, and the absence of standardized data structures. These barriers limit the interpretability, comparability, and scalability of EHR-based analyses, underscoring the need for robust methods to harmonize and extract meaningful insights from distributed, heterogeneous data. To address this, we propose MASH (Multi-source Automated Structured Hierarchy), a fully automated framework that aligns medical codes across institutions using neural optimal transport and constructs hierarchical graphs with learned hyperbolic embeddings. During training, MASH integrates information from pre-trained language models, co-occurrence patterns, textual descriptions, and supervised labels to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships among medical concepts more effectively. Applied to real-world EHR data, including diagnosis, medication, and laboratory codes, MASH produces interpretable hierarchical graphs that facilitate the navigation and understanding of heterogeneous clinical data. Notably, it generates the first automated hierarchies for unstructured local laboratory codes, establishing foundational references for downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Sequential Least-Squares Estimators with Fast Randomized Sketching for Linear Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel randomized framework for the estimation problem of large-scale linear statistical models, namely Sequential Least-Squares Estimators with Fast Randomized Sketching (SLSE-FRS), which integrates Sketch-and-Solve and Iterative-Sketching methods for the first time. By iteratively constructing and solving sketched least-squares (LS) subproblems with increasing sketch sizes to achieve better precisions, SLSE-FRS gradually refines the estimators of the true parameter vector, ultimately producing high-precision estimators. We analyze the convergence properties of SLSE-FRS, and provide its efficient implementation. Numerical experiments show that SLSE-FRS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method, and the Iterative Double Sketching (IDS) method.</description>

      <title>Learning from one graph: transductive learning guarantees via the geometry of small random worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their introduction by Kipf and Welling in $2017$, a primary use of graph convolutional networks is transductive node classification, where missing labels are inferred within a single observed graph and its feature matrix. Despite the widespread use of the network model, the statistical foundations of transductive learning remain limited, as standard inference frameworks typically rely on multiple independent samples rather than a single graph. In this work, we address these gaps by developing new concentration-of-measure tools that leverage the geometric regularities of large graphs via low-dimensional metric embeddings. The emergent regularities are captured using a random graph model; however, the methods remain applicable to deterministic graphs once observed. We establish two principal learning results. The first concerns arbitrary deterministic $k$-vertex graphs, and the second addresses random graphs that share key geometric properties with an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{G}(k,p)$ in the regime $p \in \mathcal{O}((\log (k)/k)^{1/2})$. The first result serves as the basis for and illuminates the second. We then extend these results to the graph convolutional network setting, where additional challenges arise. Lastly, our learning guarantees remain informative even with a few labelled nodes $N$ and achieve the optimal nonparametric rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ as $N$ grows.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative matrix factorization and the principle of the common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Recommendations with Contextual Bandits</title>

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music, podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page, in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.</description>

      <title>Interpretable dimension reduction for compositional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional compositional data, such as those from human microbiome studies, pose unique statistical challenges due to the simplex constraint and excess zeros. While dimension reduction is indispensable for analyzing such data, conventional approaches often rely on log-ratio transformations that compromise interpretability and distort the data through ad hoc zero replacements. We introduce a novel framework for interpretable dimension reduction of compositional data that avoids extra transformations and zero imputations. Our approach generalizes the concept of amalgamation by softening its operation, mapping high-dimensional compositions directly to a lower-dimensional simplex, which can be visualized in ternary plots. The framework further provides joint visualization of the reduction matrix, enabling intuitive, at-a-glance interpretation. To achieve optimal reduction within our framework, we incorporate sufficient dimension reduction, which defines a new identifiable objective: the central compositional subspace. For estimation, we propose a compositional kernel dimension reduction (CKDR) method. The estimator is provably consistent, exhibits sparsity that reveals underlying amalgamation structures, and comes with an intrinsic predictive model for downstream analyses. Applications to real microbiome datasets demonstrate that our approach provides a powerful graphical exploration tool for uncovering meaningful biological patterns, opening a new pathway for analyzing high-dimensional compositional data.</description>

      <title>Audits Under Resource, Data, and Access Constraints: Scaling Laws For Less Discriminatory Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI audits play a critical role in AI accountability and safety. One branch of the law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination law. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the "less discriminatory alternative" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g., model) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves comparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort. Notably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant (the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI cases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet high-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most litigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to their model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to reproduce a similar model from scratch.
  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an LDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model access. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic parity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we provide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier (PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the "low-resource regime," then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being contested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus serves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the claimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the claimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small) models. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling law holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not.</description>

      <title>GraMFedDHAR: Graph Based Multimodal Differentially Private Federated HAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest (PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods, affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.</description>

      <title>DCV-ROOD Evaluation Framework: Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework. This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast convergence to the true performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond ATE: Multi-Criteria Design for A/B Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A/B testing is a widely adopted methodology for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) in both clinical trials and online platforms. While most existing research has focused primarily on maximizing estimation accuracy, practical applications must also account for additional objectives-most notably welfare or revenue loss. In many settings, it is critical to administer treatments that improve patient outcomes or to implement plans that generate greater revenue from customers. Within a machine learning framework, such objectives are naturally captured through the notion of cumulative regret. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental trade-off between social welfare loss and statistical accuracy in (adaptive) experiments with heterogeneous treatment effects. We establish matching upper and lower bounds for the resulting multi-objective optimization problem and employ the concept of Pareto optimality to characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal experimental designs. Beyond estimating CATEs, practitioners often aim to deploy treatment policies that maximize welfare across the entire population. We demonstrate that our Pareto-optimal adaptive design achieves optimal post-experiment welfare, irrespective of the in-experiment trade-off between accuracy and welfare. Furthermore, since clinical and commercial data are often highly sensitive, it is essential to incorporate robust privacy guarantees into any treatment-allocation mechanism. To this end, we develop differentially private algorithms that continue to achieve our established lower bounds, showing that privacy can be attained at negligible cost.</description>

      <title>The Measure of Deception: An Analysis of Data Forging in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance $\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$. More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and $r&lt;d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients. Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning claims can, in principle, be detected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides robust, new evidence on the causal drivers of market troughs. We demonstrate that conclusions about these triggers are critically sensitive to model specification, moving beyond restrictive linear models with a flexible DML average partial effect causal machine learning framework. Our robust estimates identify the volatility of options-implied risk appetite and market liquidity as key causal drivers, relationships misrepresented or obscured by simpler models. These findings provide high-frequency empirical support for intermediary asset pricing theories. This causal analysis is enabled by a high-performance nowcasting model that accurately identifies capitulation events in real-time.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking: Robust and Learning-Augmented Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT) problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.</description>

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video, computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making. We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models implement it.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance. Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate models for time-dependent PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR) environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact of representation on learning efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency Frontier: Classical Shadows versus Quantum Footage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing quantum and classical processors is an important subroutine in full-stack quantum algorithms. The so-called "classical shadow" method efficiently extracts essential classical information from quantum states, enabling the prediction of many properties of a quantum system from only a few measurements. However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or when classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is not always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue quantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares classical shadows with ``quantum footage," which refers to direct quantum measurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of download efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For observables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical shadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is large and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large Hermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when the number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits fall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior include the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight $w$, accuracy requirement $\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\delta$. We also compare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of quantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow method becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper opens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid quantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the most suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian. To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original (unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve the same performance while requiring less computational resources.</description>

      <title>Neural ARFIMA model for forecasting BRIC exchange rates with long memory under oil shocks and policy uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge, particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture. Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics, including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework. Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions. The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our approach.</description>

      <title>Not All Samples Are Equal: Quantifying Instance-level Difficulty in Targeted Data Poisoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models. Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance, targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>On Rate-Optimal Partitioning Classification from Observable and from Privatised Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the classical method of partitioning classification and study its convergence rate under relaxed conditions, both for observable (non-privatised) and for privatised data. We consider the problem of classification in a $d$ dimensional Euclidean space. Previous results on the partitioning classifier worked with the strong density assumption, which is restrictive, as we demonstrate through simple examples. Here, we study the problem under much milder assumptions. We presuppose that the distribution of the inputs is a mixture of an absolutely continuous and a discrete distribution, such that the absolutely continuous component is concentrated to a $d_a$ dimensional subspace. In addition to the standard Lipschitz and margin conditions, a novel characteristic of the absolutely continuous component is introduced, by which the exact convergence rate of the classification error probability is computed, both for the binary and for the multi-label cases. Interestingly, this rate of convergence depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the inputs, $d_a$. The privacy constraints mean that the independent identically distributed data cannot be directly observed, and the classifiers are functions of the randomised outcome of a suitable local differential privacy mechanism. In this paper we add Laplace distributed noises to the discontinuations of all possible locations of the feature vector and to its label. Again, tight upper bounds on the rate of convergence of the classification error probability are derived, without the strong density assumption, such that this rate depends on $2d_a$.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Uncertainty Quantification: an Analysis of Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $Q$. Commonly, one chooses $Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the mean-field assumption), even though $p$ itself does not factorize. We show that this mismatch leads to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize, then any factorized approximation $q\!\in\!Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following three measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal precisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which for elliptical distributions is closely related to the entropy). In practice, the best variational approximation in $Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence $D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of divergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly estimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more general $\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares $\nabla \log p$ and $\nabla \log q$. We thoroughly analyze the case where $p$ is a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian. In this setting, we show that all the considered divergences can be ordered based on the estimates of uncertainty they yield as objective functions for VI. Finally, we empirically evaluate the validity of this ordering when the target distribution $p$ is not Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Robust Generative Learning with Lipschitz-Regularized $\alpha$-Divergences Allows Minimal Assumptions on Target Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the robustness of Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences as objective functionals in generative modeling, showing they enable stable learning across a wide range of target distributions with minimal assumptions. We establish that these divergences remain finite under a mild condition-that the source distribution has a finite first moment-regardless of the properties of the target distribution, making them adaptable to the structure of target distributions. Furthermore, we prove the existence and finiteness of their variational derivatives, which are essential for stable training of generative models such as GANs and gradient flows. For heavy-tailed targets, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions that connect data dimension, $\alpha$, and tail behavior to divergence finiteness, that also provide insights into the selection of suitable $\alpha$'s. We also provide the first sample complexity bounds for empirical estimations of these divergences on unbounded domains. As a byproduct, we obtain the first sample complexity bounds for empirical estimations of these divergences and the Wasserstein-1 metric with group symmetry on unbounded domains. Numerical experiments confirm that generative models leveraging Lipschitz-regularized $\alpha$-divergences can stably learn distributions in various challenging scenarios, including those with heavy tails or complex, low-dimensional, or fractal support, all without any prior knowledge of the structure of target distributions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Random Learning Rate: Theoretical Analysis of SGD Dynamics in Non-Convex Optimization via Stationary Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a random learning rate and reveal its convergence properties. SGD is a widely used stochastic optimization algorithm in machine learning, especially deep learning. Numerous studies reveal the convergence properties of SGD and its theoretically favorable variants. Among these, the analysis of convergence using a stationary distribution of updated parameters provides generalizable results. However, to obtain a stationary distribution, the update direction of the parameters must not degenerate, which limits the applicable variants of SGD. In this study, we consider a novel SGD variant, Poisson SGD, which has degenerated parameter update directions and instead utilizes a random learning rate. Consequently, we demonstrate that a distribution of a parameter updated by Poisson SGD converges to a stationary distribution under weak assumptions on a loss function. Based on this, we further show that Poisson SGD finds global minima in non-convex optimization problems and also evaluate the generalization error using this method. As a proof technique, we approximate the distribution by Poisson SGD with that of the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) and derive its stationary distribution, using the theoretical advance of the piece-wise deterministic Markov process (PDMP).</description>

      <title>Autoencoders in Function Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoencoders have found widespread application in both their original deterministic form and in their variational formulation (VAEs). In scientific applications and in image processing it is often of interest to consider data that are viewed as functions; while discretisation (of differential equations arising in the sciences) or pixellation (of images) renders problems finite dimensional in practice, conceiving first of algorithms that operate on functions, and only then discretising or pixellating, leads to better algorithms that smoothly operate between resolutions. In this paper function-space versions of the autoencoder (FAE) and variational autoencoder (FVAE) are introduced, analysed, and deployed. Well-definedness of the objective governing VAEs is a subtle issue, particularly in function space, limiting applicability. For the FVAE objective to be well defined requires compatibility of the data distribution with the chosen generative model; this can be achieved, for example, when the data arise from a stochastic differential equation, but is generally restrictive. The FAE objective, on the other hand, is well defined in many situations where FVAE fails to be. Pairing the FVAE and FAE objectives with neural operator architectures that can be evaluated on any mesh enables new applications of autoencoders to inpainting, superresolution, and generative modelling of scientific data.</description>

      <title>Confirmation Bias in Gaussian Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one's preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher's hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy.
  This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Infinite Variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16340v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent is a classic algorithm that has gained great popularity especially in the last decades as the most common approach for training models in machine learning. While the algorithm has been well-studied when stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is significantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case of infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance stochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying with index $\alpha\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established in 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients belong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the multidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance distributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution of a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate stable L\'evy process. Additionally, we explore the applications of these results in linear regression and logistic regression models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective approach for sampling from unnormalized densities is based on the idea of gradually transporting samples from an easy prior to the complicated target distribution. Two popular methods are (1) Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), where the transport is performed through successive annealed densities via prescribed Markov chains and resampling steps, and (2) recently developed diffusion-based sampling methods, where a learned dynamical transport is used. Despite the common goal, both approaches have different, often complementary, advantages and drawbacks. The resampling steps in SMC allow focusing on promising regions of the space, often leading to robust performance. While the algorithm enjoys asymptotic guarantees, the lack of flexible, learnable transitions can lead to slow convergence. On the other hand, diffusion-based samplers are learned and can potentially better adapt themselves to the target at hand, yet often suffer from training instabilities. In this work, we present a principled framework for combining SMC with diffusion-based samplers by viewing both methods in continuous time and considering measures on path space. This culminates in the new Sequential Controlled Langevin Diffusion (SCLD) sampling method, which is able to utilize the benefits of both methods and reaches improved performance on multiple benchmark problems, in many cases using only 10% of the training budget of previous diffusion-based samplers.</description>

      <title>Error-quantified Conformal Inference for Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in time series prediction is challenging due to the temporal dependence and distribution shift on sequential data. Conformal inference provides a pivotal and flexible instrument for assessing the uncertainty of machine learning models through prediction sets. Recently, a series of online conformal inference methods updated thresholds of prediction sets by performing online gradient descent on a sequence of quantile loss functions. A drawback of such methods is that they only use the information of revealed non-conformity scores via miscoverage indicators but ignore error quantification, namely the distance between the non-conformity score and the current threshold. To accurately leverage the dynamic of miscoverage error, we propose \textit{Error-quantified Conformal Inference} (ECI) by smoothing the quantile loss function. ECI introduces a continuous and adaptive feedback scale with the miscoverage error, rather than simple binary feedback in existing methods. We establish a long-term coverage guarantee for ECI under arbitrary dependence and distribution shift. The extensive experimental results show that ECI can achieve valid miscoverage control and output tighter prediction sets than other baselines.</description>

Abstract: We establish novel and general high-dimensional concentration inequalities and Berry-Esseen bounds for vector-valued martingales induced by Markov chains. We apply these results to analyze the performance of the Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm with linear function approximations, a widely used method for policy evaluation in Reinforcement Learning (RL), obtaining a sharp high-probability consistency guarantee that matches the asymptotic variance up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we establish an $O(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\log T)$ distributional convergence rate for the Gaussian approximation of the TD estimator, measured in convex distance. Our martingale bounds are of broad applicability, and our analysis of TD learning provides new insights into statistical inference for RL algorithms, bridging gaps between classical stochastic approximation theory and modern RL applications.</description>

      <title>KD$^{2}$M: A unifying framework for feature knowledge distillation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) seeks to transfer the knowledge of a teacher, towards a student neural net. This process is often done by matching the networks' predictions (i.e., their output), but, recently several works have proposed to match the distributions of neural nets' activations (i.e., their features), a process known as \emph{distribution matching}. In this paper, we propose an unifying framework, Knowledge Distillation through Distribution Matching (KD$^{2}$M), which formalizes this strategy. Our contributions are threefold. We i) provide an overview of distribution metrics used in distribution matching, ii) benchmark on computer vision datasets, and iii) derive new theoretical results for KD.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired probability metrics define a complete, universal space for statistical learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural, social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes ($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.</description>

      <title>Wild Refitting for Model-Free Excess Risk Evaluation of Opaque ML/AI Models under Bregman Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of evaluating the excess risk of classical penalized empirical risk minimization (ERM) with Bregman losses. We show that by leveraging the recently proposed wild refitting procedure (Wainwright, 2025), one can efficiently upper bound the excess risk through the so-called "wild optimism," without relying on the global structure of the underlying function class. This property makes our approach inherently model-free. Unlike conventional analyses, our framework operates with just one dataset and black-box access to the training procedure. The method involves randomized vector-valued symmetrization with an appropriate scaling of the prediction residues and constructing artificially modified outcomes, upon which we retrain a second predictor for excess risk estimation. We establish high-probability performance guarantees both under the fixed design setting and the random design setting, demonstrating that wild refitting under Bregman losses, with an appropriately chosen wild noise scale, yields a valid upper bound on the excess risk. This work thus is promising for theoretically evaluating modern opaque ML and AI models such as deep neural networks and large language models, where the model class is too complex for classical learning theory and empirical process techniques to apply.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic operator learning: generative modeling and uncertainty quantification for foundation models of differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context operator networks (ICON) are a class of operator learning methods based on the novel architectures of foundation models. Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</description>

      <title>Catapult Dynamics and Phase Transitions in Quadratic Nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent can undergo non-trivial phase transitions as a function of the learning rate. In \cite{lewkowycz2020large} it was discovered that wide neural nets can exhibit a catapult phase for super-critical learning rates, where the training loss grows exponentially quickly at early times before rapidly decreasing to a small value. During this phase the top eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) also undergoes significant evolution. In this work, we will prove that the catapult phase exists in a large class of models, including quadratic models and two-layer, homogenous neural nets. To do this, we show that for a certain range of learning rates the weight norm decreases whenever the loss becomes large. We also empirically study learning rates beyond this theoretically derived range and show that the activation map of ReLU nets trained with super-critical learning rates becomes increasingly sparse as we increase the learning rate.</description>

      <title>Sequential Gibbs Posteriors with Applications to Principal Component Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbs posteriors are proportional to a prior distribution multiplied by an exponentiated loss function, with a key tuning parameter weighting information in the loss relative to the prior and providing a control of posterior uncertainty. Gibbs posteriors provide a principled framework for likelihood-free Bayesian inference, but in many situations, including a single tuning parameter inevitably leads to poor uncertainty quantification. In particular, regardless of the value of the parameter, credible regions have far from the nominal frequentist coverage even in large samples. We propose a sequential extension to Gibbs posteriors to address this problem. We prove the proposed sequential posterior exhibits concentration and a Bernstein-von Mises theorem, which holds under easy to verify conditions in Euclidean space and on manifolds. As a byproduct, we obtain the first Bernstein-von Mises theorem for traditional likelihood-based Bayesian posteriors on manifolds. All methods are illustrated with an application to principal component analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose probabilistic Shapley inference (PSI), a novel probabilistic framework to model and infer sufficient statistics of feature attributions in flexible predictive models, via latent random variables whose mean recovers Shapley values. PSI enables efficient, scalable inference over input-to-output attributions, and their uncertainty, via a variational objective that jointly trains a predictive (regression or classification) model and its attribution distributions. To address the challenge of marginalizing over variable-length input feature subsets in Shapley value calculation, we introduce a masking-based neural network architecture, with a modular training and inference procedure. We evaluate PSI on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that it achieves competitive predictive performance compared to strong baselines, while learning feature attribution distributions -- centered at Shapley values -- that reveal meaningful attribution uncertainty across data modalities.</description>

      <title>The Over-Certainty Phenomenon in Modern Test-Time Adaptation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When neural networks are confronted with unfamiliar data that deviate from their training set, this signifies a domain shift. While these networks output predictions on their inputs, they typically fail to account for their level of familiarity with these novel observations. Prevailing works navigate test-time adaptation with the goal of curtailing model entropy, yet they unintentionally produce models that struggle with sub-optimal calibration-a dilemma we term the over-certainty phenomenon. This over-certainty in predictions can be particularly dangerous in the setting of domain shifts, as it may lead to misplaced trust. In this paper, we propose a solution that not only maintains accuracy but also addresses calibration by mitigating the over-certainty phenomenon. To do this, we introduce a certainty regularizer that dynamically adjusts pseudo-label confidence by accounting for both backbone entropy and logit norm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Expected Calibration Error and Negative Log Likelihood, all while maintaining parity in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards a General Time Series Forecasting Model with Unified Representation and Adaptive Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing availability of multi-domain time series data, there is an increasing demand for general forecasting models pre-trained on multi-source datasets to support diverse downstream prediction scenarios. Existing time series foundation models primarily focus on scaling up pre-training datasets and model sizes to enhance generalization performance. In this paper, we take a different approach by addressing two critical aspects of general forecasting models: (1) how to derive unified representations from heterogeneous multi-domain time series data, and (2) how to effectively capture domain-specific features to enable adaptive transfer across various downstream scenarios. To address the first aspect, we propose Decomposed Frequency Learning as the pre-training task, which leverages frequency-based masking and reconstruction to decompose coupled semantic information in time series, resulting in unified representations across domains. For the second aspect, we introduce the Time Series Register, which captures domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances adaptive transferability to downstream tasks. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance on seven real-world benchmarks, demonstrating remarkable few-shot and zero-shot capabilities.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.</description>

      <title>A Fully Parameter-Free Second-Order Algorithm for Convex-Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study second-order algorithms for the convex-concave minimax problem, which has attracted much attention in many fields such as machine learning in recent years. We propose a Lipschitz-free cubic regularization (LF-CR) algorithm for solving the convex-concave minimax optimization problem without knowing the Lipschitz constant. It can be shown that the iteration complexity of the LF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the restricted primal-dual gap is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{2/3}\|z_0-z^*\|^2\epsilon^{-2/3})$ , where $z_0=(x_0,y_0)$ is a pair of initial points, $z^*=(x^*,y^*)$ is a pair of optimal solutions, and $\rho$ is the Lipschitz constant. We further propose a fully parameter-free cubic regularization (FF-CR) algorithm that does not require any parameters of the problem, including the Lipschitz constant and the upper bound of the distance from the initial point to the optimal solution. We also prove that the iteration complexity of the FF-CR algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution with respect to the gradient norm is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{2/3}\|z_0-z^*\|^{4/3}\epsilon^{-2/3}) $. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of both algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FF-CR algorithm is a completely parameter-free second-order algorithm, and its iteration complexity is currently the best in terms of $\epsilon$ under the termination criterion of the gradient norm.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Maximum Entropy RL with Future State and Action Visitation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum entropy reinforcement learning integrates exploration into policy learning by providing additional intrinsic rewards proportional to the entropy of some distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which the intrinsic reward function is the relative entropy of the discounted distribution of states and actions (or features derived from these states and actions) visited during future time steps. This approach is motivated by three results. First, this new objective is a lower bound on the negated entropy of the marginal visitation distribution of states and actions, commonly used as an alternative exploration objective. Second, a policy maximizing the expected discounted sum of intrinsic rewards also maximizes a lower bound on the state-action value function of the decision process. Third, the distribution used in the intrinsic reward definition is the fixed point of a contraction operator. Existing algorithms can therefore be adapted to learn this fixed point off-policy and compute the intrinsic rewards. We finally introduce an algorithm maximizing our new objective and show that resulting policies have good state-action space coverage and achieve high-performance control.</description>

      <title>Achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ Regret in Average-Reward POMDPs with Known Observation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle average-reward infinite-horizon POMDPs with an unknown transition model but a known observation model, a setting that has been previously addressed in two limiting ways: (i) frequentist methods relying on suboptimal stochastic policies having a minimum probability of choosing each action, and (ii) Bayesian approaches employing the optimal policy class but requiring strong assumptions about the consistency of employed estimators. Our work removes these limitations by proving convenient estimation guarantees for the transition model and introducing an optimistic algorithm that leverages the optimal class of deterministic belief-based policies. We introduce modifications to existing estimation techniques providing theoretical guarantees separately for each estimated action transition matrix. Unlike existing estimation methods that are unable to use samples from different policies, we present a novel and simple estimator that overcomes this barrier. This new data-efficient technique, combined with the proposed \emph{Action-wise OAS-UCRL} algorithm and a tighter theoretical analysis, leads to the first approach enjoying a regret guarantee of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \,\log T})$ when compared against the optimal policy, thus improving over state of the art techniques. Finally, theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our method against baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning for partially observable environments, many successful algorithms have been developed within the asymmetric learning paradigm. This paradigm leverages additional state information available at training time for faster learning. Although the proposed learning objectives are usually theoretically sound, these methods still lack a precise theoretical justification for their potential benefits. We propose such a justification for asymmetric actor-critic algorithms with linear function approximators by adapting a finite-time convergence analysis to this setting. The resulting finite-time bound reveals that the asymmetric critic eliminates error terms arising from aliasing in the agent state.</description>

      <title>Statistical description and dimension reduction of categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many examples in which the statistical units of interest are samples of a continuous time categorical random process, that is to say a continuous time stochastic process taking values in a finite state space. Getting simple representations that allow comparisons of a set of trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has revolutionized data-driven modeling by enabling the synthesis of high-dimensional data across various applications, including image generation, language modeling, biomedical signal processing, and anomaly detection. Flow-based generative models provide a powerful framework for capturing complex probability distributions, offering exact likelihood estimation, efficient sampling, and deterministic transformations between distributions. These models leverage invertible mappings governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), enabling precise density estimation and likelihood evaluation. This tutorial presents an intuitive mathematical framework for flow-based generative models, formulating them as neural network-based representations of continuous probability densities. We explore key theoretical principles, including the Wasserstein metric, gradient flows, and density evolution governed by ODEs, to establish convergence guarantees and bridge empirical advancements with theoretical insights. By providing a rigorous yet accessible treatment, we aim to equip researchers and practitioners with the necessary tools to effectively apply flow-based generative models in signal processing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of rank aggregation methods for the partial label ranking problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17077v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The label ranking problem is a supervised learning scenario in which the learner predicts a total order of the class labels for a given input instance. Recently, research has increasingly focused on the partial label ranking problem, a generalization of the label ranking problem that allows ties in the predicted orders. So far, most existing learning approaches for the partial label ranking problem rely on approximation algorithms for rank aggregation in the final prediction step. This paper explores several alternative aggregation methods for this critical step, including scoring-based and non-parametric probabilistic-based rank aggregation approaches. To enhance their suitability for the more general partial label ranking problem, the investigated methods are extended to increase the likelihood of producing ties. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that scoring-based variants consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art method in handling incomplete information. In contrast, non-parametric probabilistic-based variants fail to achieve competitive performance.</description>

      <title>The feasibility of multi-graph alignment: a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish thresholds for the feasibility of random multi-graph alignment in two models. In the Gaussian model, we demonstrate an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon: above a critical threshold, exact alignment is achievable with high probability, while below it, even partial alignment is statistically impossible. In the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, we rigorously identify a threshold below which no meaningful partial alignment is possible and conjecture that above this threshold, partial alignment can be achieved. To prove these results, we develop a general Bayesian estimation framework over metric spaces, which provides insight into a broader class of high-dimensional statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo Features for Kernel Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods in random feature approximations for kernel-based learning. Compared to the classical Monte Carlo (MC) approach \citep{rahimi2007random}, RQMC improves the deterministic approximation error bound from $O_P(1/\sqrt{M})$ to $O(1/M)$ (up to logarithmic factors), matching the rate achieved by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods \citep{huangquasi}. Beyond the deterministic error bound guarantee, we further establish additional average error bounds for RQMC features: some requiring weaker assumptions and others significantly reducing the exponent of the logarithmic factor. In the context of kernel ridge regression, we show that RQMC features offer computational advantages over MC features while preserving the same statistical error rate. Empirical results further show that RQMC methods maintain stable performance in both low and moderately high-dimensional settings, unlike QMC methods, which suffer from significant performance degradation as dimension increases.</description>

      <title>The Ground Cost for Optimal Transport of Angular Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal transport problem over angular velocity dynamics given by the controlled Euler equation. The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over a hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost is equal to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift.</description>

      <title>Efficient $Q$-Learning and Actor-Critic Methods for Robust Average Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of $Q$-learning and actor-critic algorithms for robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under contamination, total-variation (TV) distance, and Wasserstein uncertainty sets. A key ingredient of our analysis is showing that the optimal robust $Q$ operator is a strict contraction with respect to a carefully designed semi-norm (with constant functions quotiented out). This property enables a stochastic approximation update that learns the optimal robust $Q$-function using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We also provide an efficient routine for robust $Q$-function estimation, which in turn facilitates robust critic estimation. Building on this, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm that learns an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We provide numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Precise Bayesian Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its long history, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and variational training remain underused in practice: standard Gaussian posteriors misalign with network geometry, KL terms can be brittle in high dimensions, and implementations often add complexity without reliably improving uncertainty. We revisit the problem through the lens of normalization. Because normalization layers neutralize the influence of weight magnitude, we model uncertainty \emph{only in weight directions} using a von Mises-Fisher posterior on the unit sphere. High-dimensional geometry then yields a single, interpretable scalar per layer--the effective post-normalization noise $\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$--that (i) corresponds to simple additive Gaussian noise in the forward pass and (ii) admits a compact, dimension-aware KL in closed form. We derive accurate, closed-form approximations linking concentration $\kappa$ to activation variance and to $\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$ across regimes, producing a lightweight, implementation-ready variational unit that fits modern normalized architectures and improves calibration without sacrificing accuracy. This dimension awareness is critical for stable optimization in high dimensions. In short, by aligning the variational posterior with the network's intrinsic geometry, BNNs can be simultaneously principled, practical, and precise.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Powered Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI), a statistical framework for both causal and predictive inference using unstructured data, including text and images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models -- such as large language models and diffusion models -- not only to generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional representations that are guaranteed to capture their underlying structure. Applying machine learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2) estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Driven Reliability: Selective Prediction and Trustworthy Deployment in Modern Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where reliability is paramount. This thesis investigates how uncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML, focusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is low.
  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty signals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By ensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight, post-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep ensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance. Crucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP), allowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find that while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains robust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty trade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective classification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve -- identifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions can close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking errors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show that uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or deny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining calibration audits with verifiable inference.
  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating, and safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make accurate predictions -- but also know when to say "I do not know".</description>

      <title>Confounding is a Pervasive Problem in Real World Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine, ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Generalization of Anti-Regularization for Parametric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-regularization introduces a reward term with a reversed sign into the loss function, deliberately amplifying model expressivity in small-sample regimes while ensuring that the intervention gradually vanishes as the sample size grows through a power-law decay schedule. We formalize spectral safety conditions and trust-region constraints, and we design a lightweight safeguard that combines a projection operator with gradient clipping to guarantee stable intervention. Theoretical analysis extends to linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel regime, providing practical guidance on the choice of decay exponents through the balance between empirical risk and variance. Empirical results show that Anti-regularization mitigates underfitting in both regression and classification while preserving generalization and improving calibration. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and safeguards are essential to avoiding overfitting and instability. As an alternative, we also propose a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that maintains constant per-sample complexity. Anti-regularization constitutes a simple and reproducible procedure that integrates seamlessly into standard empirical risk minimization pipelines, enabling robust learning under limited data and resource constraints by intervening only when necessary and vanishing otherwise.</description>

      <title>A Composite-Loss Graph Neural Network for the Multivariate Post-Processing of Ensemble Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasting systems have advanced meteorology by providing probabilistic estimates of future states. Nonetheless, systematic biases often persist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional parametric post-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can produce calibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead times, yet often struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions. To address this, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula coupling and the Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore realistic inter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study is the multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural network (dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the energy score (ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two datasets: WRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF visibility forecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms all empirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant improvements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the continuous ranked probability score or the ES, according to the evaluated multivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF forecasts, the rank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable dependency information, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial relationships than either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or historical observational rank structures. Notably, incorporating VS into the loss function improved the univariate performance for both target variables compared to training on ES alone. Moreover, for the visibility forecasts, the ES-VS combination even outperformed the strongest calibrated reference in terms of univariate performance.</description>
