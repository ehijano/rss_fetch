      <title>Protein property prediction with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable prediction of variant effects in proteins has seen considerable progress in recent years. The increasing availability of data in this regime has improved both the prediction performance and our ability to track progress in the field, measured in terms of prediction accuracy averaged over many datasets. For practical use in protein engineering, it is important that we can also provide reliable uncertainty estimates for our predictions, but such metrics are rarely reported. We here provide a Gaussian process regression model, Kermut, which obtains state-of-the-art performance for protein property prediction while also offering estimates of uncertainty through its posterior. We proceed by assessing the quality of these uncertainty estimates. Our results show that the model provides meaningful overall calibration, but that accurate instance-specific uncertainty quantification remains challenging. We hope that this will encourage future work in this promising direction.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective generative AI for designing novel brain-targeting small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strict selectivity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents one of the most formidable challenges to successful central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery. Computational methods to generate BBB permeable drugs in silico may be valuable tools in the CNS drug design pipeline. However, in real-world applications, BBB penetration alone is insufficient; rather, after transiting the BBB, molecules must bind to a specific target or receptor in the brain and must also be safe and non-toxic. To discover small molecules that concurrently satisfy these constraints, we use multi-objective generative AI to synthesize drug-like BBB-permeable small molecules. Specifically, we computationally synthesize molecules with predicted binding affinity against dopamine receptor D2, the primary target for many clinically effective antipsychotic drugs. After training several graph neural network-based property predictors, we adapt SyntheMol (Swanson et al., 2024), a recently developed Monte Carlo Tree Search-based algorithm for antibiotic design, to perform a multi-objective guided traversal over an easily synthesizable molecular space. We design a library of 26,581 novel and diverse small molecules containing hits with high predicted BBB permeability and favorable predicted safety and toxicity profiles, and that could readily be synthesized for experimental validation in the wet lab. We also validate top scoring molecules with molecular docking simulation against the D2 receptor and demonstrate predicted binding affinity on par with risperidone, a clinically prescribed D2-targeting antipsychotic. In the future, the SyntheMol-based computational approach described here may enable the discovery of novel neurotherapeutics for currently intractable disorders of the CNS.</description>

      <title>FoldToken2: Learning compact, invariant and generative protein structure language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalent nature of 3D coordinates has posed long term challenges in protein structure representation learning, alignment, and generation. Can we create a compact and invariant language that equivalently represents protein structures? Towards this goal, we propose FoldToken2 to transfer equivariant structures into discrete tokens, while maintaining the recoverability of the original structures. From FoldToken1 to FoldToken2, we improve three key components: (1) invariant structure encoder, (2) vector-quantized compressor, and (3) equivalent structure decoder. We evaluate FoldToken2 on the protein structure reconstruction task and show that it outperforms previous FoldToken1 by 20\% in TMScore and 81\% in RMSD. FoldToken2 probably be the first method that works well on both single-chain and multi-chain protein structures quantization. We believe that FoldToken2 will inspire further improvement in protein structure representation learning, structure alignment, and structure generation tasks.</description>

      <title>DCI: An Accurate Quality Assessment Criteria for Protein Complex Structure Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of proteins is the basis for studying protein function and drug design. The emergence of AlphaFold 2 has greatly promoted the prediction of protein 3D structures, and it is of great significance to give an overall and accurate evaluation of the predicted models, especially the complex models. Among the existing methods for evaluating multimer structures, DockQ is the most commonly used. However, as a more suitable metric for complex docking, DockQ cannot provide a unique and accurate evaluation in the non-docking situation. Therefore, it is necessary to propose an evaluation strategy that can directly evaluate the whole complex without limitation and achieve good results. In this work, we proposed DCI score, a new evaluation strategy for protein complex structure models, which only bases on distance map and CI (contact-interface) map, DCI focuses on the prediction accuracy of the contact interface based on the overall evaluation of complex structure, is not inferior to DockQ in the evaluation accuracy according to CAPRI classification, and is able to handle the non-docking situation better than DockQ. Besides, we calculated DCI score on CASP datasets and compared it with CASP official assessment, which obtained good results. In addition, we found that DCI can better evaluate the overall structure deviation caused by interface prediction errors in the case of multi-chains. Our DCI is available at \url{https://gitee.com/WendaWang/DCI-score.git}, and the online-server is available at \url{http://mialab.ruc.edu.cn/DCIServer/}.</description>

      <title>Frontiers in integrative structural biology: modeling disordered proteins and utilizing in situ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrative modeling enables structure determination for large macromolecular assemblies by combining data from multiple sources of experiment data with theoretical and computational predictions. Recent advancements in AI-based structure prediction and electron cryo-microscopy have sparked renewed enthusiasm for integrative modeling; structures from AI-based methods can be integrated with in situ maps to characterize large assemblies. This approach previously allowed us and others to determine the architectures of diverse macromolecular assemblies, such as nuclear pore complexes, chromatin remodelers, and cell-cell junctions. Experimental data spanning several scales was used in these studies, ranging from high-resolution data, such as X-ray crystallography and Alphafold structures, to low-resolution data, such as cryo-electron tomography maps and data from co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Two recurrent modeling challenges emerged across a range of studies. First, modeling disordered regions, which constituted a significant portion of these assemblies, necessitated the development of new methods. Second, methods needed to be developed to utilize the information from cryo-electron tomography, a timely challenge as structural biology is increasingly moving towards in situ characterization. Here, we recapitulate recent developments in the modeling of disordered proteins and the analysis of cryo-electron tomography data and highlight opportunities for method development in the context of integrative modeling.</description>

      <title>Impact of Co-Excipient Selection on Hydrophobic Polymer Folding: Insights for Optimal Formulation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stabilization of liquid biological products is a complex task that depends on the chemical composition of both the active ingredient and any excipients in solution. Frequently, a large number of unique excipients are required to stabilize biologics, though it is not well-known how these excipients interact with one another. To probe these excipient-excipient interactions, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of arginine -- a widely used excipient with unique properties -- in solution either alone or with equimolar lysine or glutamate. We studied the effects of these mixtures on a hydrophobic polymer model to isolate excipient mechanisms on hydrophobic interactions, relevant to both protein folding and biomolecular self-assembly. We observed that arginine is the most effective single excipient in stabilizing hydrophobic polymer collapse, and its effectiveness can be augmented by lysine or glutamate addition. We utilized a decomposition of the potential of mean force to identify that the key source of arginine-lysine and arginine-glutamate synergy on polymer collapse is a reduction in attractive polymer-excipient direct interactions. Further, we applied principles from network theory to characterize the local solvent network that embeds the hydrophobic polymer. Through this approach, we found that arginine enables a more highly connected and stable network than in pure water, lysine, or glutamate solutions. Importantly, these network properties are preserved when lysine or glutamate are added to arginine solutions. Overall, we highlight the importance of identifying key molecular consequences of co-excipient selection, aiding in the establishment of rational formulation design rules.</description>

      <title>ZeroDDI: A Zero-Shot Drug-Drug Interaction Event Prediction Method with Semantic Enhanced Learning and Dual-Modal Uniform Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can result in various pharmacological changes, which can be categorized into different classes known as DDI events (DDIEs). In recent years, previously unobserved/unseen DDIEs have been emerging, posing a new classification task when unseen classes have no labelled instances in the training stage, which is formulated as a zero-shot DDIE prediction (ZS-DDIE) task. However, existing computational methods are not directly applicable to ZS-DDIE, which has two primary challenges: obtaining suitable DDIE representations and handling the class imbalance issue. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method named ZeroDDI for the ZS-DDIE task. Specifically, we design a biological semantic enhanced DDIE representation learning module, which emphasizes the key biological semantics and distills discriminative molecular substructure-related semantics for DDIE representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a dual-modal uniform alignment strategy to distribute drug pair representations and DDIE semantic representations uniformly in a unit sphere and align the matched ones, which can mitigate the issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments showed that ZeroDDI surpasses the baselines and indicate that it is a promising tool for detecting unseen DDIEs. Our code has been released in https://github.com/wzy-Sarah/ZeroDDI.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Molecular Property Predictions with Graph Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent class of data-driven methods for molecular property prediction. However, a key limitation of typical GNN models is their inability to quantify uncertainties in the predictions. This capability is crucial for ensuring the trustworthy use and deployment of models in downstream tasks. To that end, we introduce AutoGNNUQ, an automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach for molecular property prediction. AutoGNNUQ leverages architecture search to generate an ensemble of high-performing GNNs, enabling the estimation of predictive uncertainties. Our approach employs variance decomposition to separate data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainties, providing valuable insights for reducing them. In our computational experiments, we demonstrate that AutoGNNUQ outperforms existing UQ methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and UQ performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, we utilize t-SNE visualization to explore correlations between molecular features and uncertainty, offering insight for dataset improvement. AutoGNNUQ has broad applicability in domains such as drug discovery and materials science, where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for decision-making.</description>

      <title>Scaffold Splits Overestimate Virtual Screening Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual Screening (VS) of vast compound libraries guided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) models is a highly productive approach to early drug discovery. Data splitting is crucial for better benchmarking of such AI models. Traditional random data splits produce similar molecules between training and test sets, conflicting with the reality of VS libraries which mostly contain structurally distinct compounds. Scaffold split, grouping molecules by shared core structure, is widely considered to reflect this real-world scenario. However, here we show that the scaffold split also overestimates VS performance. The reason is that molecules with different chemical scaffolds are often similar, which hence introduces unrealistically high similarities between training molecules and test molecules following a scaffold split. Our study examined three representative AI models on 60 NCI-60 datasets, each with approximately 30,000 to 50,000 molecules tested on a different cancer cell line. Each dataset was split with three methods: scaffold, Butina clustering and the more accurate Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering. Regardless of the model, model performance is much worse with UMAP splits from the results of the 2100 models trained and evaluated for each algorithm and split. These robust results demonstrate the need for more realistic data splits to tune, compare, and select models for VS. For the same reason, avoiding the scaffold split is also recommended for other molecular property prediction problems. The code to reproduce these results is available at https://github.com/ScaffoldSplitsOverestimateVS</description>
