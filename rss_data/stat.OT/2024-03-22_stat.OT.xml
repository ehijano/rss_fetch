      <title>Quantitative Analysis of AI-Generated Texts in Academic Research: A Study of AI Presence in Arxiv Submissions using AI Detection Tool</title>

Abstract: Many people are interested in ChatGPT since it has become a prominent AIGC model that provides high-quality responses in various contexts, such as software development and maintenance. Misuse of ChatGPT might cause significant issues, particularly in public safety and education, despite its immense potential. The majority of researchers choose to publish their work on Arxiv. The effectiveness and originality of future work depend on the ability to detect AI components in such contributions. To address this need, this study will analyze a method that can see purposely manufactured content that academic organizations use to post on Arxiv. For this study, a dataset was created using physics, mathematics, and computer science articles. Using the newly built dataset, the following step is to put originality.ai through its paces. The statistical analysis shows that Originality.ai is very accurate, with a rate of 98%.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to predict university enrolment choices through students' high school background in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the influence of Italian high school students' proficiency in mathematics and the Italian language on their university enrolment choices, specifically focusing on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) courses. We distinguish between students from scientific and humanistic backgrounds in high school, providing valuable insights into their enrolment preferences. Furthermore, we investigate potential gender differences in response to similar previous educational choices and achievements. The study employs gradient boosting methodology, known for its high predicting performance and ability to capture non-linear relationships within data, and adjusts for variables related to the socio-demographic characteristics of the students and their previous educational achievements. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the enrolment choices based on previous high school achievements. The findings shed light on the complex interplay of academic proficiency, gender, and high school background in shaping students' choices regarding university education, with implications for educational policy and future research endeavours.</description>
