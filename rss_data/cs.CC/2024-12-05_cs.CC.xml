      <title>On one-way functions and the average time complexity of almost-optimal compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that one-way functions exist if and only there exists an efficient distribution relative to which almost-optimal compression is hard on average. The result is obtained by combining a theorem of Ilango, Ren, and Santhanam and one by Bauwens and Zimand.</description>

      <title>An even simpler hard variant of Not-All-Equal 3-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Not-All-Equal 3-Sat remains NP-complete when restricted to instances that simultaneously satisfy the following properties: (i) The clauses are given as the disjoint union of k partitions, for any fixed $k \geq 4$, of the variable set into subsets of size 3, and (ii) each pair of distinct clauses shares at most one variable. Property (i) implies that each variable appears in exactly $k$ clauses and each clause consists of exactly 3 unnegated variables. Therewith, we improve upon our earlier result (Darmann and D\"ocker, 2020). Complementing the hardness result for at least $4$ partitions, we show that for $k\leq 3$ the corresponding decision problem is in P. In particular, for $k\in \{1,2\}$, all instances that satisfy Property (i) are nae-satisfiable.
  By the well-known correspondence between Not-All-Equal 3-Sat} and hypergraph coloring, we obtain the following corollary of our results: For $k\geq 4$, Bicolorability is NP-complete for linear 3-uniform $k$-regular hypergraphs even if the edges are given as a decomposition into $k$ perfect matchings; with the same restrictions, for $k \leq 3$ Bicolorability is in P, and for $k \in \{1,2\}$ all such hypergraphs are bicolorable.
  Finally, we deduce from a construction in the work by Pilz (Pilz, 2019) that every instance of Positive Planar Not-All-Equal Sat with at least three distinct variables per clause is nae-satisfiable. Hence, when restricted to instances with a planar incidence graph, each of the above variants of Not-All-Equal 3-Sat turns into a trivial decision problem.</description>

      <title>Theoretical limitations of multi-layer Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers, especially the decoder-only variants, are the backbone of most modern large language models; yet we do not have much understanding of their expressive power except for the simple $1$-layer case.
  Due to the difficulty of analyzing multi-layer models, all previous work relies on unproven complexity conjectures to show limitations for multi-layer Transformers. In this work, we prove the first $\textit{unconditional}$ lower bound against multi-layer decoder-only transformers. For any constant $L$, we prove that any $L$-layer decoder-only transformer needs a polynomial model dimension ($n^{\Omega(1)}$) to perform sequential composition of $L$ functions over an input of $n$ tokens.
  As a consequence, our results give: (1) the first depth-width trade-off for multi-layer transformers, exhibiting that the $L$-step composition task is exponentially harder for $L$-layer models compared to $(L+1)$-layer ones; (2) an unconditional separation between encoder and decoder, exhibiting a hard task for decoders that can be solved by an exponentially shallower and smaller encoder; (3) a provable advantage of chain-of-thought, exhibiting a task that becomes exponentially easier with chain-of-thought.
  On the technical side, we propose the multi-party $\textit{autoregressive}$ $\textit{communication}$ $\textit{model}$ that captures the computation of a decoder-only Transformer. We also introduce a new proof technique that finds a certain $\textit{indistinguishable}$ $\textit{decomposition}$ of all possible inputs iteratively for proving lower bounds in this model. We believe our new communication model and proof technique will be helpful to further understand the computational power of transformers.</description>

      <title>On Approximability of $\ell_2^2$ Min-Sum Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem is to partition an input set into clusters $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{p,q\in C_i}\|p-q\|_2^2$. Although $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering is NP-hard, it is not known whether it is NP-hard to approximate $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering beyond a certain factor.
  In this paper, we give the first hardness-of-approximation result for the $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than $1.056$ and moreover, assuming a balanced variant of the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis, it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than 1.327.
  We then complement our hardness result by giving the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-coreset construction for $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering. Our coreset uses $\mathcal{O}\left(k^{\varepsilon^{-4}}\right)$ space and can be leveraged to achieve a polynomial-time approximation scheme with runtime $nd\cdot f(k,\varepsilon^{-1})$, where $d$ is the underlying dimension of the input dataset and $f$ is a fixed function.
  Finally, we consider a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to an oracle that outputs a label $i\in[k]$ for input point, thereby implicitly partitioning the input dataset into $k$ clusters that induce an approximately optimal solution, up to some amount of adversarial error $\alpha\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a $\frac{1+\gamma\alpha}{(1-\alpha)^2}$-approximation to $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering, for a fixed constant $\gamma&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Distinguishability of Product Distributions through Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of samples $x_1, \dots , x_k$ promised to be drawn from one of two distributions $X_0, X_1$, a well-studied problem in statistics is to decide $\textit{which}$ distribution the samples are from. Information theoretically, the maximum advantage in distinguishing the two distributions given $k$ samples is captured by the total variation distance between $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$. However, when we restrict our attention to $\textit{efficient distinguishers}$ (i.e., small circuits) of these two distributions, exactly characterizing the ability to distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ is more involved and less understood.
  In this work, we give a general way to reduce bounds on the computational indistinguishability of $X_0$ and $X_1$ to bounds on the $\textit{information-theoretic}$ indistinguishability of some specific, related variables $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$. As a consequence, we prove a new, tight characterization of the number of samples $k$ needed to efficiently distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ with constant advantage as
  \[
  k = \Theta\left(d_H^{-2}\left(\widetilde{X}_0, \widetilde{X}_1\right)\right),
  \] which is the inverse of the squared Hellinger distance $d_H$ between two distributions $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$ that are computationally indistinguishable from $X_0$ and $X_1$. Likewise, our framework can be used to re-derive a result of Geier (TCC 2022), proving nearly-tight bounds on how computational indistinguishability scales with the number of samples for arbitrary product distributions.</description>
