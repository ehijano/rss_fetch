      <title>Integrated modeling of RF-Induced Tungsten Erosion at ICRH Antenna Structures in the WEST Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces STRIPE (Simulated Transport of RF Impurity Production and Emission), an advanced modeling framework designed to analyze material erosion and the global transport of eroded impurities originating from radio-frequency (RF) antenna structures in magnetic confinement fusion devices. STRIPE integrates multiple computational tools, each addressing different levels of physics fidelity: SolEdge3x for scrape-off-layer plasma profiles, COMSOL for 3D RF rectified voltage fields, RustBCA code for erosion yields and surface interactions, and GITR for 3D ion energy-angle distributions and global impurity transport. The framework is applied to an ion cyclotron RF heated, L-mode discharge #57877 in the WEST Tokamak, where it predicts a tenfold increase in tungsten erosion at RF antenna limiters under RF-sheath rectification conditions, compared to cases with only a thermal sheath. Highly charged oxygen ions (O6+ and higher) emerge as dominant contributors to tungsten sputtering at the antenna limiters. To verify model accuracy, a synthetic diagnostic tool based on inverse photon efficiency or S/XB coefficients from the ColRadPy-collisional radiative model enables direct comparisons between simulation results and experimental spectroscopic data. Model predictions, assuming plasma composition of 1% oxygen and 99% deuterium, align closely with measured neutral tungsten (W-I) spectroscopic data for the discharge #57877, validating the framework's accuracy. Currently, the STRIPE framework is being extended to investigate plasma-material interactions in other RF-heated linear and toroidal devices, offering valuable insights for RF antenna design, impurity control, and performance optimization in future fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Light Diagnostics for Wakefields at AWAKE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the implementation of light diagnostics for studying the self-modulation instability of a long relativistic proton bunch in a 10m-long plasma. The wakefields driven by the proton bunch dissipate their energy in the surrounding plasma. The amount of light emitted as atomic line radiation is related to the amount of energy dissipated in the plasma. We describe the setup and calibration of the light diagnostics, configured for a discharge plasma source and a vapor plasma source. For both sources, we analyze measurements of the light from the plasma only (no proton bunch). We show that with the vapor plasma source, the light signal is proportional to the energy deposited in the vapor/plasma by the ionizing laser pulse. We use this dependency to obtain the parameters of an imposed plasma density step. This dependency also forms the basis for ongoing studies, focused on investigating the wakefield evolution along the plasma.</description>

      <title>Characterization and performance of the Apollon main short-pulse laser beam following its commissioning at 2 PW level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the second commissioning phase of the short-focal-length area of the Apollon laser facility (located in Saclay, France), which was performed with the main laser beam (F1), scaled to a peak power of 2 PetaWatt. Under the conditions that were tested, this beam delivered on-target pulses of maximum energy up to 45 J and 22 fs duration. Several diagnostics were fielded to assess the performance of the facility. The on-target focal spot and its spatial stability, as well as the secondary sources produced when irradiating solid targets, have all been characterized, with the goal of helping users design future experiments. The laser-target interaction was characterized, as well as emissions of energetic ions, X-ray and neutrons recorded, all showing good laser-to-target coupling efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrated the simultaneous fielding of F1 with the auxiliary 0.5 PW F2 beam of Apollon, enabling dual beam operation. The present commissioning will be followed in 2025 by a further commissioning stage of F1 at the 8 PW level, en route to the final 10 PW goal.</description>

      <title>Zonal fields as catalysts and inhibitors of turbulence-driven magnetic islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel coalescence process is shown to take place in plasma fluid simulations, leading to the formation of large-scale magnetic islands that become dynamically important in the system. The parametric dependence of the process on the plasma $\beta$ and the background magnetic shear is studied, and the process is broken down at a fundamental level, allowing to clearly identify its causes and dynamics. The formation of magnetic-island-like structures at the spatial scale of the unstable modes is observed quite early in the non-linear phase of the simulation for most cases studied, as the unstable modes change their structure from interchange-like to tearing-like. This is followed by a slow coalescence process that evolves these magnetic structures towards larger and larger scales, adding to the large-scale tearing-like modes that already form by direct coupling of neighbouring unstable modes, but remain sub-dominant without the contribution from the smaller scales through coalescence. The presence of the cubic non-linearities retained in the model is essential in the dynamics of this process. The zonal fields are key actors of the overall process, acting as mediators between the competitive mechanisms from which Turbulence Driven Magnetic Islands can develop. The zonal current is found to slow down the formation of large-scale magnetic islands, acting as an inhibitor, while the zonal flow is needed to allow the system to transfer energy to the larger scales, acting as a catalyst for the island formation process.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic simulations of the effects of magnetic islands on microturbulence in KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrokinetic simulations are utilized to study effects of magnetic islands on the ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence in the KSTAR tokamak with resonant magnetic perturbations. Simulations show that the transport is controlled by the nonlinear interactions between the ITG turbulence and self-generated vortex flows and zonal flows, leading to an anisotropic structure of fluctuation and transport on the poloidal plane and in the toroidal direction. Magnetic islands greatly enhance turbulent transport of both particle and heat. The turbulent transport exhibits variations in the toroidal direction, with transport through the resonant layer near the island X-point being enhanced when the X-point is located at the outer mid-plane. A quantitative agreement is shown between simulations and KSTAR experiments in terms of time frequency and perpendicular wavevector spectrum.</description>

      <title>Application of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for ITER Burning Plasma Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of burning plasmas in tokamaks are crucial for advancing controlled thermonuclear fusion. This study applies the NeuralPlasmaODE, a multi-region multi-timescale transport model, to simulate the complex energy transfer processes in ITER deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasmas. Our model captures the interactions between energetic alpha particles, electrons, and ions, which are vital for understanding phenomena such as thermal runaway instability. We employ neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) for the numerical derivation of diffusivity parameters, enabling precise modeling of energy interactions between different plasma regions. By leveraging transfer learning, we utilize model parameters derived from DIII-D experimental data, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of our simulations without training from scratch. Applying this model to ITER's inductive and non-inductive operational scenarios, our results demonstrate that radiation and transport processes effectively remove excess heat from the core plasma, preventing thermal runaway instability. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in advancing our understanding and control of burning plasma dynamics in fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Formulation for Energy Loss, Collision Rate, and Entropy Evolution in Collisionless and Collisional Plasmas: Transition from Maxwellian to Non-Maxwellian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalised Hamiltonian formulation to model the collision rate, energy loss, entropy evolution, and the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian distributions in a plasma. By incorporating gyrokinetic turbulence and the effects of collisions, we derive a Hamiltonian that captures both the collisionless and collisional dynamics of a plasma. The formulation accounts for entropy production, energy transport, and the resulting changes in plasma confinability. We show how entropy increase during the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian states impacts fusion efficiency and plasma stability. Finally, we provide a mathematical proof that links entropy evolution to energy loss and the emergent properties of confinement.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of edge diffraction and launching of transverse electric plasmons at two-dimensional junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact solution for electromagnetic wave diffraction at the junction of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) is obtained and analyzed for electric field polarized along the edge. A special emphasis is paid to the metal-contacted and terminated edges. In the former case, electric field at the edge tends to zero; in the latter case, it tends to a finite value which is screened by 2d system in an anomalous fashion. For both types of edge and capacitive type of 2d conductivity, an incident wave excites transverse electric 2d plasmons. The amplitude of excited TE plasmons is maximized and becomes order of incident wave amplitude for capacitive impedance of 2DES order of free space impedance. For both large and small 2DES impedance, the amplitude of TE plasmons tends to zero according to the power laws which are explicitly derived.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reconnection with effective resistivity: I. Dynamics and reconnection rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is one of the most fundamental mechanisms considered responsible for the acceleration of relativistic particles in astrophysical jets and magnetospheres of compact objects. Understanding the properties of the dissipation of magnetic fields and the formation of non-ideal electric fields is of paramount importance to quantify the efficiency of reconnection at energizing charged particles. Recent results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suggest that the fundamental properties of how magnetic fields dissipate in a current sheet might be captured by an "effective resistivity" formulation, which would locally enhance the amount of magnetic energy dissipated and favor the onset of fast reconnection. Our goal is to assess this ansatz quantitatively by comparing fluid models of magnetic reconnection with a non-constant magnetic diffusivity and fully-kinetic models. We perform 2D resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations of magnetic reconnection combined to PIC simulations using the same initial conditions (namely a Harris current sheet). We explore the impact of crucial parameters such as the plasma magnetization, its mass density, the grid resolution, and the characteristic plasma skin depth. Our ResRMHD models with effective resistivity can quantitatively reproduce the dynamics of fully-kinetic models of relativistic magnetic reconnection. In particular, they lead to reconnection rates consistent with PIC simulations, while for constant-resistivity fluid models the reconnection dynamics is generally 10 times slower. Even at modest resolutions the adoption of an effective resistivity can qualitatively capture the properties of kinetic reconnection models and produce reconnection rates compatible with collisionless models, i.e. of the order of $\sim10^{-1}$.</description>
