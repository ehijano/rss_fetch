      <title>Exploring doubly-heavy tetraquarks in constituent-quark-model based meson-meson coupled-channels approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHCb Collaboration announced in 2021 the discovery of a new tetraquark-like state, named $T_{cc}^+$, with minimum quark content $cc\bar u\bar d$, close to the $D^0D^{*+}$ threshold. This has motivated countless theoretical works trying to identify the dynamics which is responsible of the formation of such state; in particular, the one performed by us in Ref. \cite{Ortega:2022efc}, where a $D^0D^{*+}$ molecular candidate whose mass, width, scattering length and effective ranges are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. We explore herein the possibility of having $T_{cc}^+$ partners in all doubly-heavy tetraquark sectors, considering doubly represented light antiquarks $u$, $d$ or $s$, and taking into account all possible spin-parity quantum numbers. The computation is done using a constituent-quark-model based meson-meson coupled-channels framework which has been tested many times in the last fifteen years describing conventional heavy mesons and baryons, their coupling with hadron-hadron thresholds but also in exploring its application to compact multiquark structures. The advantage of using an approach with such a relatively large history is that it allows us to make predictions because all the parameters have already been constrained from our previous works. Then, from this perspective, we present a parameter-free model-dependent prediction of doubly-heavy tetraquarks that may be partners of the discovered $T_{cc}^+$ state.</description>

      <title>Quasi-fragmentation functions in the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasi-fragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function (FF) where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan (DLY) result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics (QCD2) in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>$B \to D^*\ell\nu_\ell$ semileptonic form factors from lattice QCD with M\"obius domain-wall quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the form factors for the $B \to D^*\ell\nu_\ell$ decay in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD. For all quark flavors, we employ the M\"obius domain-wall action, which preserves chiral symmetry to a good precision. Our gauge ensembles are generated at three lattice cutoffs $a^{-1} \sim 2.5$, 3.6 and 4.5 GeV with pion masses as low as $M_\pi \sim 230$ MeV. The physical lattice size $L$ satisfies the condition $M_\pi L \geq 4$ to control finite volume effects (FVEs), while we simulate a smaller size at the smallest $M_\pi$ to directly examine FVEs. The bottom quark masses are chosen in a range from the physical charm quark mass to $0.7 a^{-1}$ to control discretization effects. We extrapolate the form factors to the continuum limit and physical quark masses based on heavy meson chiral perturbation theory at next-to-leading order. Then the recoil parameter dependence is parametrized using a model independent form leading to our estimate of the decay rate ratio between the tau ($\ell = \tau$) and light lepton ($\ell = e,\mu$) channels $R(D^*) = 0.252(22)$ in the Standard Model. A simultaneous fit with recent data from the Belle experiment yields $|V_{cb}| = 39.19(91)\times 10^{-3}$, which is consistent with previous exclusive determinations, and shows good consistency in the kinematical distribution of the differential decay rate between the lattice and experimental data.</description>

      <title>New mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma: first-principle results from rotating SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in rigidly rotating $N_c = 3$ gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal equilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase transition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within a few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the confining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.</description>

      <title>Interacting chiral fermions on the lattice with matrix product operator norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for simulating interacting chiral fermions on the lattice while preserving unitarity and locality and without breaking the chiral symmetry. The fermion doubling problem is circumvented by constructing a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm. When projecting our theory on the the single-particle sector, we recover the framework of Stacey fermions, and we demonstrate that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. Technically, we make use of a matrix product operator norm to mimick the boundary of a higher dimensional topological theory. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code to demonstrate that the ground state for large system sizes can be determined efficiently. As our tensor network approach does not exhibit any sign problem, we can add a chemical potential and study real-time evolution.</description>

      <title>Uncovering gauge-dependent critical order-parameter correlations by a stochastic gauge fixing at O($N$)$^*$ and Ising$^*$ continuous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the O($N$)$^*$ transitions that occur in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge $N$-vector model, and the analogous Ising$^*$ transitions occurring in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge Higgs model, corresponding to an $N$-vector model with $N=1$. At these transitions, gauge-invariant correlations behave as in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. Instead, the nongauge invariant spin correlations are trivial and therefore the spin order parameter that characterizes the spontaneous breaking of the O($N$) symmetry in standard $N$-vector/Ising systems is apparently absent. We define a novel gauge fixing procedure -- we name it stochastic gauge fixing -- that allows us to define a gauge-dependent vector field that orders at the transition and is therefore the appropriate order parameter for the O($N$) symmetry breaking. To substantiate this approach, we perform numerical simulations for $N=3$ and $N=1$. A finite-size scaling analysis of the numerical data allows us to confirm the general scenario: the gauge-fixed spin correlation functions behave as the corresponding functions computed in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. The emergence of a critical vector order parameter in the gauge model shows the complete equivalence of the O($N$)$^*$/Ising$^*$ and O($N$)/Ising universality classes.</description>
