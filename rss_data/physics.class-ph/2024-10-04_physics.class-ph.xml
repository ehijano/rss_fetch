      <title>Taylor's swimming sheet near a soft boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1951, G.I. Taylor modeled swimming microorganisms by hypothesizing an infinite sheet in 2D moving in a viscous medium due to a wave passing through it. This simple model not only captured the ability of microorganisms to swim due to the wavy motion of a flagella, but further development into the model captured the optimal nature of metachronal waves observed in ciliates. While the additional effects of nearby rigid boundaries and complex environments have been addressed, herein we explore the correction induced by a nearby soft boundary. Our simple model allows us to show that the magnitude of the swimming velocity gets modified near soft boundaries, and reduces for transverse waves while it increases for longitudinal waves. We further delve into the energetics of the process and the deformation of the corresponding soft boundary, highlighting the synchronization of the oscillations induced on the soft boundary with the waves passing through the sheet and the corresponding changes to the power exerted on the fluid.</description>

      <title>Extremal micropolar materials for elastic wave cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymmetric transformation elasticity offers a promising method to control elastic waves. However, this method requires elastic materials that support asymmetric stresses, which is not objective within the Cauchy elasticity framework. Nevertheless, asymmetric stress tensor is a typical feature of micropolar continuum theory. Yet, possible connection between micropolar continuum theory and the asymmetric elasticity transformation has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that extremal micropolar media, which refer to micropolar media with easy deformation modes, can be used to design elastic cloaks following the asymmetric transformation method. A metamaterial model is proposed to achieve the required extremal micropolar parameters for cloaking. We further design a two-dimensional metamaterial cloak and verify its cloaking performance numerically. An excellent agreement between the metamaterial cloak simulation and an effective-medium calculation is obtained. This study unveils a novel strategy for controlling elastic waves through micropolar media and also sheds light on interesting properties of extremal micropolar materials.</description>
