      <title>Phase autoencoder for limit-cycle oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a phase autoencoder that encodes the asymptotic phase of a limit-cycle oscillator, a fundamental quantity characterizing its synchronization dynamics. This autoencoder is trained in such a way that its latent variables directly represent the asymptotic phase of the oscillator. The trained autoencoder can perform two functions without relying on the mathematical model of the oscillator: first, it can evaluate the asymptotic phase and phase sensitivity function of the oscillator; second, it can reconstruct the oscillator state on the limit cycle in the original space from the phase value as an input. Using several examples of limit-cycle oscillators, we demonstrate that the asymptotic phase and phase sensitivity function can be estimated only from time-series data by the trained autoencoder. We also present a simple method for globally synchronizing two oscillators as an application of the trained autoencoder.</description>

      <title>Vibrational resonance: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, vibrational resonance has garnered significant interest and evolved into a prominent research field. Classical vibrational resonance examines the response of a nonlinear system excited by two signals: a weak, slowly varying characteristic signal, and a fast-varying auxiliary signal. The characteristic signal operates on a much longer time scale than the auxiliary signal. Through the cooperation of the nonlinear system and these two excitations, the faint input can be substantially amplified, showcasing the constructive role of the fast-varying signal. Since its inception, vibrational resonance has been extensively studied across various disciplines, including physics, mathematics, biology, neuroscience, laser science, chemistry, and engineering. Here, we delve into a detailed discussion of vibrational resonance and the most recent advances, beginning with an introduction to characteristic signals commonly used in its study. Furthermore, we compile numerous nonlinear models where vibrational resonance has been observed to enhance readers' understanding and provide a basis for comparison. Subsequently, we present the metrics used to quantify vibrational resonance, as well as offer a theoretical formulation. This encompasses the method of direct separation of motions, linear and nonlinear vibrational resonance, re-scaled vibrational resonance, ultrasensitive vibrational resonance, and the role of noise in vibrational resonance. Later, we showcase two practical applications of vibrational resonance: one in image processing and the other in fault diagnosis. This presentation offers a comprehensive and versatile overview of vibrational resonance, exploring various facets and highlighting promising avenues for future research in both theory and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Regularity in the Double Pendulum with Lagrangian Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we apply the method of Lagrangian descriptors as an indicator to study the chaotic and regular behavior of trajectories in the phase space of the classical double pendulum system. In order to successfully quantify the degree of chaos with this tool, we first derive Hamilton's equations of motion for the problem in non-dimensional form, showing that they can be written compactly using matrix algebra. Once the dynamical equations are obtained, we carry out a parametric study in terms of the system's total energy and the other model parameters (lengths and masses of the pendulums, and gravity), to determine the extent of the chaotic and regular regions in the phase space. Our numerical results show that for a given mass ratio, the maximum chaotic fraction of phase space trajectories is attained when the pendulums have equal lengths. Moreover, we give a characterization of the growth and decay of chaos in the system in terms of the model parameters, and explore the hypothesis that the chaotic fraction follows an exponential law over different energy regimes.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Infection Spreading and Directed Evolution in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two simple mathematical models of the epidemic. At first, we study the repetitive infection spreading in a simplified SIRS model including the effect of the decay of the acquired immune. The model is an intermediate model of the SIRS model including the recruitment and death terms and the SIR model in which the recovered population is assumed to be never infected again. When the decay rate \delta of the immune is sufficiently small, the multiple infection spreading occurs in spikes. The model equation can be reduced to be a map when the decay rate \delta is sufficiently small, and the spike-like multiple infection spreading is reproduced in the mapping. The period-doubling bifurcation and chaos are found in the simplified SIRS model with seasonal variation. The nonlinear phenomena are reproduced by the map. Next, we study coupled SIRS equations for the directed evolution where the mutation is expressed with a diffusion-type term. A kind of reaction-diffusion equation is derived by the continuum approximation for the infected population I. The reaction-diffusion equation with the linear dependence of infection rate on the type space has an exact Gaussian solution with a time-dependent average and variance. The propagation of the Gaussian pulse corresponds to the successive transitions of the dominant variant.</description>

      <title>Optical chaos synchronisation in a cascaded injection experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the synchronization of chaos generated by semiconductor lasers in a cascade injection configuration, i.e., a tunable master laser is used to generate chaos by optical injection in a transmitter laser that injects light into a receiver laser. Chaos synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver lasers is achieved with a correlation coefficient of 90 % for a measurement bandwidth up to 35 GHz. Two parameter regions of good synchronization are found, corresponding to the alignment of the oscillation frequencies of the receiver laser with either the transmitter laser or the master laser.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric quantum mechanics, through its differential-geometric underpinning, provides additional tools of analysis and interpretation that bring quantum mechanics closer to classical mechanics: state spaces in both are equipped with symplectic geometry. This opens the door to revisiting foundational questions and issues, such as the nature of quantum entropy, from a geometric perspective. Central to this is the concept of geometric quantum state -- the probability measure on a system's space of pure states. This space's continuity leads us to introduce two analysis tools, inspired by Renyi's information theory, to characterize and quantify fundamental properties of geometric quantum states: the quantum information dimension that is the rate of geometric quantum state compression and the dimensional geometric entropy that monitors information stored in quantum states. We recount their classical definitions, information-theoretic meanings, and physical interpretations, and adapt them to quantum systems via the geometric approach. We then explicitly compute them in various examples and classes of quantum system. We conclude commenting on future directions for information in geometric quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Persistence and Doubling of Chaotic Attractors in Coupled 3-Cell Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two novel phenomena for unidirectionally coupled 3-cell Hopfield neural networks (HNNs) are investigated. The first one is the persistence of chaos, which means the permanency of sensitivity and infinitely many unstable periodic oscillations in the response HNN even if the networks are not synchronized in the generalized sense. Doubling of chaotic attractors is the second phenomenon realized in this study. It can be achieved when the response network possesses two stable point attractors in the absence of the driving. This feature leads to the formation of two coexisting chaotic attractors with disjoint basins. Lyapunov functions are utilized to deduce the presence of an invariant region, and the sensitivity is rigorously proved. The absence of synchronization is approved via the auxiliary system approach and analysis of conditional Lyapunov exponents. Additionally, quadruple and octuple coexisting chaotic attractors are demonstrated, and the formation of hyperchaos is discussed.</description>
