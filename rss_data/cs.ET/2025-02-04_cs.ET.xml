      <title>Closed-Loop Long-Term Experimental Molecular Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fluid-based experimental molecular communication (MC) testbed which uses media modulation. Motivated by the natural human cardiovascular system, the testbed operates in a closed-loop tube system. The proposed system is designed to be biocompatible, resource-efficient, and controllable from outside the tube. As signaling molecule, the testbed employs the green fluorescent protein variant "Dreiklang" (GFPD). GFPDs can be reversibly switched via light of different wavelengths between a bright fluorescent state and a less fluorescent state. GFPDs in solution are filled into the testbed prior to the start of information transmission and remain there for an entire experiment. For information transmission, an optical transmitter (TX) and an optical eraser (EX), which are located outside the tube, are used to write and erase the information encoded in the state of the GFPDs, respectively. At the receiver (RX), the state of the GFPDs is read out by fluorescence detection. In our testbed, due to the closed-loop setup, we observe new forms of inter-symbol interferences (ISI), which do not occur in short experiments and open-loop systems. For the testbed, we developed a communication scheme, which includes blind transmission start detection, symbol-by-symbol synchronization, and adaptive threshold detection. We comprehensively analyze our MC experiments using different performance metrics. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the error-free transmission of 5370 bit at a data rate of 36 $\textrm{bit}\, \textrm{min}^{\boldsymbol{-1}}$ using 8-ary modulation and the error-free binary transmission of around 90000 bit at a data rate of 12 $\textrm{bit}\, \textrm{min}^{\boldsymbol{-1}}$. For the latter experiment, data was transmitted for a period of 125 hours. All signals recorded and parts of the evaluation code are publicly available on Zenodo and Github, respectively.</description>

      <title>Decoding User Concerns in AI Health Chatbots: An Exploration of Security and Privacy in App Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI powered health chatbot applications are increasingly utilized for personalized healthcare services, yet they pose significant challenges related to user data security and privacy. This study evaluates the effectiveness of automated methods, specifically BART and Gemini GenAI, in identifying security privacy related (SPR) concerns within these applications' user reviews, benchmarking their performance against manual qualitative analysis. Our results indicate that while Gemini's performance in SPR classification is comparable to manual labeling, both automated methods have limitations, including the misclassification of unrelated issues. Qualitative analysis revealed critical user concerns, such as data collection practices, data misuse, and insufficient transparency and consent mechanisms. This research enhances the understanding of the relationship between user trust, privacy, and emerging mobile AI health chatbot technologies, offering actionable insights for improving security and privacy practices in AI driven health chatbots. Although exploratory, our findings highlight the necessity for rigorous audits and transparent communication strategies, providing valuable guidance for app developers and vendors in addressing user security and privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Manipulation Skill and Hand Grasp Force from Forearm Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of human hand configuration and the forces they exert is critical for effective teleoperation and skill transfer in robotic manipulation. A deeper understanding of human interactions with objects can further enhance teleoperation performance. To address this need, researchers have explored methods to capture and translate human manipulation skills and applied forces to robotic systems. Among these, biosignal-based approaches, particularly those using forearm ultrasound data, have shown significant potential for estimating hand movements and finger forces. In this study, we present a method for simultaneously estimating manipulation skills and applied hand force using forearm ultrasound data. Data collected from seven participants were used to train deep learning models for classifying manipulation skills and estimating grasp force. Our models achieved an average classification accuracy of 94.87 percent plus or minus 10.16 percent for manipulation skills and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.51 plus or minus 0.19 Newtons for force estimation, as evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. These results highlight the effectiveness of forearm ultrasound in advancing human-machine interfacing and robotic teleoperation for complex manipulation tasks. This work enables new and effective possibilities for human-robot skill transfer and tele-manipulation, bridging the gap between human dexterity and robotic control.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Analysis of Scattering From Building Surfaces at Millimeter-Wave Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In future air-to-ground integrated networks, the scattering effects from ground-based scatterers, such as buildings, cannot be neglected in millimeter-wave and higher frequency bands, and have a significant impact on channel characteristics. However, current scattering measurement studies primarily focus on single incident angles within the incident plane, leading to insufficient characterization of scattering properties. In this paper, we present scattering measurements conducted at 28 GHz on various real-world building surfaces with multiple incident angles and three-dimensional (3D) receiving angles. The measured data are analyzed in conjunction with parameterized scattering models in ray tracing and numerical simulations. Results indicate that for millimeter-wave channel modeling near building surfaces, it is crucial to account not only for surface materials but also for the scattering properties of the building surfaces with respect to the incident angle and receiving positions in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for dynamic resource allocation in wireless communication systems. An environment that includes a base station, multiple antennas, and user equipment is created. Using the RLlib library, various DRL algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are then applied. These algorithms are compared based on their ability to optimize resource allocation, focusing on the impact of different learning rates and scheduling policies. The findings demonstrate that the choice of algorithm and learning rate significantly influences system performance, with DRL providing more efficient resource allocation compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quandaries: Unraveling Encoding Vulnerabilities in Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionize fields like machine learning, security, and healthcare. Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising area, enhancing learning algorithms using quantum computers. However, QML models are lucrative targets due to their high training costs and extensive training times. The scarcity of quantum resources and long wait times further exacerbate the challenge. Additionally, QML providers may rely on third party quantum clouds for hosting models, exposing them and their training data to potential threats. As QML as a Service (QMLaaS) becomes more prevalent, reliance on third party quantum clouds poses a significant security risk. This work demonstrates that adversaries in quantum cloud environments can exploit white box access to QML models to infer the users encoding scheme by analyzing circuit transpilation artifacts. The extracted data can be reused for training clone models or sold for profit. We validate the proposed attack through simulations, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between encoding schemes. We report that 95% of the time, the encoding can be predicted correctly. To mitigate this threat, we propose a transient obfuscation layer that masks encoding fingerprints using randomized rotations and entanglement, reducing adversarial detection to near random chance 42% , with a depth overhead of 8.5% for a 5 layer QNN design.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited stochastic optical neural networks operating at a few quanta per activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy efficiency in computation is ultimately limited by noise, with quantum limits setting the fundamental noise floor. Analog physical neural networks hold promise for improved energy efficiency compared to digital electronic neural networks. However, they are typically operated in a relatively high-power regime so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large, and the noise can be treated as a perturbation. We study optical neural networks where all layers except the last are operated in the limit that each neuron can be activated by just a single photon, and as a result the noise on neuron activations is no longer merely perturbative. We show that by using a physics-based probabilistic model of the neuron activations in training, it is possible to perform accurate machine-learning inference in spite of the extremely high shot noise (SNR ~ 1). We experimentally demonstrated MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a test accuracy of 98% using an optical neural network with a hidden layer operating in the single-photon regime; the optical energy used to perform the classification corresponds to just 0.038 photons per multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation. Our physics-aware stochastic training approach might also prove useful with non-optical ultra-low-power hardware.</description>

      <title>Optimal State Preparation for Logical Arrays on Zoned Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to solve problems previously deemed infeasible. However, high error rates necessitate quantum error correction for practical applications. Seminal experiments with zoned neutral atom architectures have shown remarkable potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To fully harness their potential, efficient software solutions are vital. A key aspect of quantum error correction is the initialization of physical qubits representing a logical qubit in a highly entangled state. This process, known as state preparation, is the foundation of most quantum error correction codes and, hence, a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generating a schedule of target-specific instructions to perform the state preparation is highly complex. First software tools exist but are not suitable for the zoned neutral atom architectures. This work addresses this gap by leveraging the computational power of SMT solvers and generating minimal schedules for the state preparation of logical arrays. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that actively utilizing zones to shield idling qubits consistently results in higher fidelities than solutions disregarding these zones. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap/tree/main/src/na/nasp.</description>

      <title>A scalable event-driven spatiotemporal feature extraction circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-driven sensors, which produce data only when there is a change in the input signal, are increasingly used in applications that require low-latency and low-power real-time sensing, such as robotics and edge devices. To fully achieve the latency and power advantages on offer however, similarly event-driven data processing methods are required. A promising solution is the TDE: an event-based processing element which encodes the time difference between events on different channels into an output event stream. In this work we introduce a novel TDE implementation on CMOS. The circuit is robust to device mismatch and allows the linear integration of input events. This is crucial for enabling a high-density implementation of many TDEs on the same die, and for realising real-time parallel processing of the high-event-rate data produced by event-driven sensors.</description>
