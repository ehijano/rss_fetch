      <title>Collision energy and system size dependence of longitudinal flow decorrelation in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions, the initial collision geometry and its fluctuations drive the collective expansion of final-state hadrons in the transverse plane. However, longitudinal fluctuations induce event-plane twist and flow magnitude asymmetries, collectively known as longitudinal flow decorrelation. Using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model, we systematically investigate the dependence of collision energy and system size of this phenomenon with Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 19.6, 27, 54.4, 200 GeV and isobar collisions (Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru) at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The results reveal two distinct decorrelation components: $r_n(\eta)$, which includes flow magnitude asymmetry and event-plane twist, and $R_n(\eta)$ which arises purely from event-plane twist. Both $r_n(\eta)$ and $R_n(\eta)$ decrease linearly with $\eta$ and exhibit a significant dependence on collision energy and the size of the system. Through the slope parameters $F_n$ in the linear parametrization $r_n(\eta) = 1-2F_n\eta$, we can quantify the strength of decorrelation. We further observe that both $F_2$ and $F_3$ demonstrate a pronounced power-law scaling behavior with collision energy, following the relation $F_n \propto log \sqrt{s_{NN}}$. These results provide valuable insights into the three-dimensional modeling of the initial stage and the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>A Universal Upper Bound on the Pressure-to-Energy Density Ratio in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation-of-state (EOS) parameter $\phi \equiv P/\varepsilon$, defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density, encapsulates the fundamental response of matter under extreme compression. Its value at the center of the most massive neutron star (NS), $\x \equiv \phi_{\rm c} = P_{\rm c}/\varepsilon_{\rm c}$, sets a universal upper bound on the maximum denseness attainable by any form of visible matter anywhere in the Universe. Remarkably, owing to the intrinsically nonlinear structure of the EOS in General Relativity (GR), this bound is forced to lie far below the naive Special Relativity (SR) limit of unity. In this work, we refine the theoretical upper bound on $\x$ in a self-consistent manner by incorporating, in addition to the causality constraint from SR, the mass-sphere stability condition associated with the mass evolution pattern in the vicinity of the NS center. This condition is formulated within the intrinsic-and-perturbative analysis of the dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations (IPAD-TOV) framework. The combined constraints yield an improved bound, $\x \lesssim 0.385$, which is slightly above but fully consistent with the previously derived causal-only limit, $\x \lesssim 0.374$. We further derive an improved scaling relation for NS compactness and verify its universality across a broad set of 284 realistic EOSs, including models with first-order phase transitions, exotic degrees of freedom, continuous crossover behavior, and deconfined quark cores. The resulting bound on $\x$ thus provides a new, EOS-independent window into the microphysics of cold superdense matter compressed by strong-field gravity in GR.</description>

      <title>Helicity Dependent Distribution Functions of the Proton and $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using continuum Schwinger function methods, a coherent set of predictions for proton, $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ distribution functions (DFs) has been made available -- both helicity dependent and unpolarised. The results and comparisons between them reveal impacts of diquark correlations and SU$(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking, some of which are highlighted in this contribution. For instance: in-proton ratios of helicity-dependent/unpolarised valence-quark DFs are presented; it is highlighted that, were it not for the presence of axialvector diquarks in the $\Sigma^0$, the valence strange quark would carry none of the $\Sigma^0$ spin; and the sign and size of polarised gluon DFs is discussed -- at a scale typical of modern measurements, gluon partons carry roughly 40% of each octet baryon's spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Newtonian physics, the excitation spectrum of a fluid is the same in all reference frames, up to a trivial shift. In special relativity, this is no longer the case. Relativity of simultaneity causes different inertial observers to measure markedly different excitation spectra, with stability being the only property known to be Lorentz invariant in all causal theories. Here, we show that, under a certain Onsager-like symmetry principle (which applies to kinetic theory and transient hydrodynamics), it is possible to place rigorous bounds on phase velocities, eigenmode convergence radii, spectral gaps, and equilibration rates in any inertial frame, using only information about the rest frame spectrum at zero wavenumber. The conventional intuition coming from time dilation is also shown to lead to generically wrong predictions, but becomes accurate if the fluid is non-relativistic in the rest frame.</description>

Abstract: Sixty years ago, the first excited state of a proton/neutron was ``born.'' During this time, we learned a lot about it, specifically - how unique this case is: a single resonance with two pole positions on different Riemann sheets. Let me present a brief history to remind readers how development progressed. Sure, history is sometimes something that never happened, described by those who were never there...</description>

      <title>Universality of scaled particle spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles in ultrarelativistic collisions of large and small collision systems. In order to isolate information contained in the momentum dependence, we propose to scale the spectra by the total particle number and mean transverse momentum -- global quantities which are already well studied. We observe an interesting, nearly universal, centrality-independent shape in the scaled spectra, similar to scalings that have been studied previously. This scaling behavior breaks down at large transverse momentum and for very small systems, such as those produced in p-p collisions. We perform hybrid hydrodynamic simulations and show that, in these simulations, a centrality-independent shape is a consequence of an event-by-event independence. Our results motivate further theoretical and experimental investigations of the regime of validity of this scaling phenomenon and their physical interpretation at different collision energies and systems.</description>

Abstract: I consider the so-called nuclear polarization correction to the 1S-levels in light to intermediate muonic atoms. An easy to use recipe to compute it is given. The calculation includes the effect of the nucleon polarization, i.e. the contribution from inelastic states in the hadronic range, and Coulomb corrections beyond the leading logarithm approximation to both nuclear and nucleon polarization. I provide numerical estimates for $4\leq Z\leq41$, compare to the estimates in the literature and discuss the need for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Dipole Polarizability of Finite Nuclei as a Probe of Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction at N$^3$LO in nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) is an efficient tool for solving nuclear many-body problems, which takes high-fidelity lattice chiral interactions as input and computes nuclear low-energy observables via quantum Monte Carlo techniques. In this work, we present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces on the lattice with the isospin-breaking effects fully taken into account. We focus on both the charge-independence breaking (CIB) and charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) effects. Specifically, we include the isospin-breaking effect from the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions in the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP), the Coulomb force for the $pp$ interaction and the contribution of two additional charge-dependent contact operators. We also explicitly incorporate the two-pion-exchange potentials which was mostly neglected in previous NLEFT calculations. With these improvements, we are able to accurately reproduce the $np$ and $pp$ scattering phase shifts up to relative momentum $p \sim 200$ MeV as well as the deuteron properties. The construction of these charge-dependent lattice nuclear forces establishes a solid foundation for future high-precision nuclear ab initio calculations within the NLEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Towards a microscopic description of nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of a comprehensive microscopic approach to describe nucleus-nucleus elastic collisions by means of an optical potential derived at first order in multiple-scattering theory and computed by folding the projectile and target nuclear densities with the nucleon-nucleon $t$ matrix, which describes the interaction between each nucleon of the projectile and each nucleon of the target. Chiral interactions are consistently used in the calculation of the $t$ matrix and of the nonlocal nuclear densities, which are computed within the ab initio no-core shell model. Cross sections calculated for $\alpha$ collisions on $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O at projectile energies in the range 100-300 MeV are presented and compared with available data. For momentum transfer $q$ up to about $1.0$ fm$^{-1}$ our results are in good agreement with the experimental data, whereas for higher momenta a reduction of the imaginary contributions is needed.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Observable Signatures of a Quarkyonic Phase in Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performing Bayesian inference on quarkyonic equation-of-state models for neutron star matter, we find they satisfy all current astrophysical observations, thus reinforcing the argument for the use of such neutron star matter equation-of-state models alongside traditional ones. To observationally differentiate between stars with and without a quarkyonic phase, we identify a novel observational signature- the slope of the mass-radius relation at some fixed mass in conjunction with the sound speed at the star's center. In this plane, we find quarkyonic stars in a region with high central sound speed and positive slope, that is distinct from purely nucleonic stars. High accuracy NS radii measurements facilitated by the next generation of detectors, coupled with ongoing studies of mapping astrophysical observables to microphysical properties like sound speed can be used for testing this signature. Our results indicate that a neutron star with these properties would be a strong evidence for existence of a quarkyonic phase or a similar crossover transition in its core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the $X(1880)$, the structure around the $\bar{p}p$ threshold that appears in the $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant mass spectrum in the decay process of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$. Nucleon-antinucleon rescattering is taken into account in our analysis, and the decay amplitude of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ can be obtained by the distorted wave Born approximation. With these amplitudes, we analyze the contributions to the $X(1880)$ from different partial waves. Our analysis suggests that the $X(1880)$ should be isoscalar $0^{-+}$, and it is generated by the threshold behavior.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation from an Analytic Hydrodynamic Model with Hadronic and QGP Sources in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, a nearly perfect fluid is formed, known as the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). After a short thermalization period, the evolution of this medium can be described by the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics. As the system expands and cools, the QGP undergoes a transition into hadronic matter, marking the onset of quark confinement. Direct photons offer insights into an essential stage of evolution, spanning from the onset of thermalization to the suppression of thermal photon production, which occurs within the hadronic phase. This paper builds upon and extends a previously published solution of relativistic hydrodynamics, incorporating an equation of state that falls within the same class as that predicted by lattice QCD. Based on this solution, a completely analytic model is constructed to describe thermal photon production, accounting for the quark-hadron transition. The model is tested against PHENIX measurements of non-prompt direct photon spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental data, enabling the investigation of the centrality dependence of the initial temperature. These results provide a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of thermal radiation in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we discuss both relativistic and perturbative QCD corrections to the transition form-factor ${\cal F}_{\eta_Q}{(t_1,t_2)}$ for the process $\gamma^*(q_1) \gamma^*(q_2) \leftrightarrow \eta_Q(P)$ with dependencies on the normalised photon virtualities $t_1=q_1^2/m_Q^2$ and $t_2=q_2^2/m_Q^2$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. We resum a class of relativistic corrections to all orders in the relativistic parameter $\langle v^2 \rangle_{\eta_Q}$. In addition, we include perturbative QCD corrections up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. This involves the computation of two-loop amplitudes with two off-shell photons. We explore three different phenomenological applications of our transition form-factors for the charmonium case. We first study the ratio $\vert {\cal F}_{\eta_c}{(t_1,0)} \vert/ \vert {\cal F}_{\eta_c}{(0,0)} \vert$ for the single space-like photon case and compare our results with the existing $\eta_c$ measurements from the BaBar collaboration. Secondly, we consider observables for the case of double space-like photons and discuss the impact of the different corrections. The NNLO corrections for this case are presented here for the first time in the literature. Finally, we revisit the decay width $\Gamma[\eta_c \rightarrow \gamma \gamma]$ and compare it with the existing PDG value.</description>

      <title>High-energy $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ photoproduction and the nature of exotic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of hybrid mesons in photoproduction experiments can provide essential insight into the inner workings of quantum chromodynamics in the strong coupling regime. In particular, the study of final $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ states is of great interest due to the presence of the lowest lying hybrid candidate with manifestly exotic quantum numbers, the $\pi_1(1600)$. In this work, a double-vector exchange model with Reggeized $\rho$ and $\omega$ trajectories is developed to describe the photoproduction of $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ in the high-mass region. Results are presented for the differential cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries in the energy region of interest to the GlueX experiment. The model contains no free parameters, and reproduces the magnitude and $t$-dependence of existing CLAS data at $E_\gamma=5$\gev. The model predicts a stronger asymmetry in the $\eta^\prime \pi$ channel than in the $\eta \pi$ channel, consistent with what has previously been observed in pion beam experiments. This suggests that the sizeable production of exotic odd waves in $\eta'\pi$ is not necessarily related to the presence of gluon-rich environments. Confirmation of these predicted asymmetries from forthcoming GlueX data would enable further predictions of the low-energy spectrum.</description>
