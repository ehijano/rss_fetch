      <title>A Multi-Evidence Framework Rescues Low-Power Prognostic Signals and Rejects Statistical Artifacts in Cancer Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Standard genome-wide association studies in cancer genomics rely on statistical significance with multiple testing correction, but systematically fail in underpowered cohorts. In TCGA breast cancer (n=967, 133 deaths), low event rates (13.8%) create severe power limitations, producing false negatives for known drivers and false positives for large passenger genes. Results: We developed a five-criteria computational framework integrating causal inference (inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimation) with orthogonal biological validation (expression, mutation patterns, literature evidence). Applied to TCGA-BRCA mortality analysis, standard Cox+FDR detected zero genes at FDR&lt;0.05, confirming complete failure in underpowered settings. Our framework correctly identified RYR2 -- a cardiac gene with no cancer function -- as a false positive despite nominal significance (p=0.024), while identifying KMT2C as a complex candidate requiring validation despite marginal significance (p=0.047, q=0.954). Power analysis revealed median power of 15.1% across genes, with KMT2C achieving only 29.8% power (HR=1.55), explaining borderline statistical significance despite strong biological evidence. The framework distinguished true signals from artifacts through mutation pattern analysis: RYR2 showed 29.8% silent mutations (passenger signature) with no hotspots, while KMT2C showed 6.7% silent mutations with 31.4% truncating variants (driver signature). This multi-evidence approach provides a template for analyzing underpowered cohorts, prioritizing biological interpretability over purely statistical significance.

      <title>Topological Sequence Analysis of Genomes: Category theory Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence data, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, exhibit intricate, multi-scale structures that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, particularly those relying on alignment or purely statistical representations. In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence analysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category, capturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction. Substructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation, and their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological features. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by incorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology. The resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across a variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative studies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in these tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond sequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the integration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence analysis.</description>
