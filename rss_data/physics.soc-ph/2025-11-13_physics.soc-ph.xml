      <title>The Emergence of Socio-Economic Structure: A First-Principles Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between individual agent behavior and macroscopic societal patterns is a central challenge in the social sciences. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via a kinetic theory formulation. We demonstrate that complex, empirically-observed phenomena, such as the concentration of populations in cities and the emergence of power-law wealth distributions, can be derived directly from a microscopic model of agents governed by underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our multi-scale derivation yields the exact mesoscopic fluctuating (Dean-Kawasaki) dynamics and the macroscopic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system of equations. The analytical solution of this system reveals how a heterogeneous resource landscape alone is sufficient to generate the coupled structures of spatial and economic inequality, thus providing a formal link between micro-level stochasticity and macro-level deterministic order.</description>

      <title>COMBUST: Gridded combustible mass estimates of the built environment in the conterminous United States (1975-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing occurrence of natural hazards such as wildfires and drought, along with urban expansion and land consumption, causes increasing levels of fire risk to populations and human settlements. Moreover, increasing geopolitical instability in many regions of the world requires evaluation of scenarios related to potential hazards caused by military operations. Quantitative knowledge on burnable fuels and their spatio-temporal distribution across landscapes is crucial for risk and potential damage assessments. While there is good understanding of the distributions of biomass fuels based on remote sensing observations, the combustible mass of the built environment has rarely been quantified in a spatially explicit manner. Therefore, we developed fine-grained estimates of urban fuels for the conterminous United States, estimating the combustible mass of building materials, building contents, and personal vehicles at 250 m spatial resolution. The resulting dataset is called COMBUST (Combustible mass of the built environment in the conterminous United States) and includes different backcasting scenarios from 1975 to 2020. COMBUST is based on the integration of a variety of geospatial data sources such as Earth-observation derived data, real estate data, statistical estimates and volunteered geographic information. COMBUST is accompanied by COMBUST PLUS, a set of consistently enumerated gridded datasets facilitating combustion exposure modelling of buildings and population. These datasets constitute a rich resource for ecological and social science applications, as well as for disaster risk management and planning-related decision making for U.S. settlements. COMBUST is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15611963.</description>

      <title>Threshold model of language competition including the bilingual state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a threshold model of language competition which includes intermediate bilingual state. The model is based on the Minett-Wang model but through the introduction of thresholds in the language shift rates it incorporates the effects of memory and learning. The model is piecewise-linear, allowing the exact analytical treatment. We study the symmetric case where two competing languages are equivalent in terms of status and social pressure and provide a complete list of the various dynamical regimes. We also study several limiting regimes corresponding to asymmetric systems and characterize the full spectrum of possible asymptotic behaviors. Unlike the Minett-Wang model, which always predicts the extinction of one of the languages, the proposed new model exhibits a wide range of possible equilibrium scenarios, including equilibrium states of coexistence. Most commonly, in such coexistence regimes the minority language speakers are either completely monolingual or completely bilingual.</description>

      <title>Urban Complexity through Vision Intelligence: Variance, Gradients, and Correlations across Six Italian Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a scalable methodology for the objective analysis of quality metrics across six major Italian metropolitan areas: Rome, Bologna, Florence, Milan, Naples, and Palermo. Leveraging georeferenced Street View imagery and an advanced Urban Vision Intelligence system, we systematically classify the visual environment, focusing on key metrics such as the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) and the Fa\c{c}ade Degradation Score (FDS). The findings quantify Structural Heterogeneity (Spatial Variance), revealing significant quality dispersion (e.g., Milan $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{PCI}}=1.52$), and confirm that the classical Urban Gradient -- quality variation as a function of distance from the core -- is consistently weak across all sampled cities ($R^2 &lt; 0.03$), suggesting a complex, polycentric, and fragmented morphology. In addition, a Cross-Metric Correlation Analysis highlights stable but modest interdependencies among visual dimensions, most notably a consistent positive association between fa\c{c}ade quality and greenery ($\rho \approx 0.35$), demonstrating that structural and contextual urban qualities co-vary in weak yet interpretable ways. Together, these results underscore the diagnostic potential of Vision Intelligence for capturing the integrated spatial and morphological structure of Italian cities and motivate a large national-scale analysis.</description>

      <title>Global Population and Carrying Capacity in the Anthropocene: the Relative Growth Rate Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report provides insights into global population dynamics since the beginning of the Anthropocene, focusing on empirical data and minimizing a priori the impact of model assumptions. It explores the Relative Growth Rate concept, introduced recently to global population studies by Lehman et al. [PNAS 118, e2024150118 (2021)] and subsequently extended to its analytical counterpart [PLoS ONE 20, eo323165 (2025)]. The analysis reveals a general non-monotonic growth pattern in the Anthropocene, emphasizing the uniqueness of the Industrial Revolution era. For the first 290 years, the Doomsday critical scaling provides a superior description for population changes, with a singularity at 2026. This is followed by the crossover to an exceptional 'reversed criticality' patterm, which has held over the last six decades, to the present day. The analysis suggests that the evolution of the human Real Intelligence (RI) population during the Innovations-driven Industrial Revolution times - a period of rapidly increasing connectivity and complexity - can serve as a model counterpart for the puzzling dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) growth. The final conclusion is positive: the catastropic Doomsday singularity can be avoided due to the generic system constraints , both for RI and AI.</description>

      <title>Mapping memory-biased dynamics with compact models reveals overlapping communities in large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world systems, from social networks to protein-protein interactions and species distributions, exhibit overlapping flow-based communities that reflect their functional organisation. However, reliably identifying such overlapping flow-based communities requires higher-order relational data, which are often unavailable. To address this challenge, we capitalise on the flow model underpinning the representation-learning algorithm node2vec and model higher-order flows through memory-biased random walks on first-order networks. Instead of simulating these walks, we model their higher-order dynamic constraints with compact models and control model complexity with an information-theoretic approach. Using the map equation framework, we identify overlapping modules in the resulting higher-order networks. Our compact-model approach proves robust across synthetic benchmark networks, reveals interpretable overlapping communities in empirical networks, and scales to large networks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

      <title>Decoding street network morphologies and their correlation to travel mode choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban morphology has long been recognized as a factor shaping human mobility, yet comparative and formal classifications of urban form across metropolitan areas remain limited. Building on theoretical principles of urban structure and advances in unsupervised learning, we systematically classified the built environment of nine U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators such as density, connectivity, and spatial configuration. The resulting morphological types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence (-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44), and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility (-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p &lt; 1e-19), highlighting that the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping transportation choices. Our findings extend previous work by offering a reproducible framework for classifying urban form and demonstrate the added value of morphological analysis in comparative urban research. These results suggest that urban form should be treated as a key variable in mobility planning and provide empirical support for incorporating spatial typologies into sustainable urban policy design.</description>

      <title>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Cartography of the Epistemic Diffusion of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience and AI have an intertwined history, largely relayed in the literature of both fields. In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.</description>
