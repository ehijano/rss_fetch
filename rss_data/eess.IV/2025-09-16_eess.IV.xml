      <title>MIDOG 2025 Track 2: A Deep Learning Model for Classification of Atypical and Normal Mitotic Figures under Class and Hardness Imbalances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Accurate classification of mitotic figures into normal and atypical types is crucial for tumor prognostication in digital pathology. However, developing robust deep learning models for this task is challenging due to the subtle morphological differences, as well as significant class and hardness imbalances in real-world histopathology datasets. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning approach based on a ResNet backbone with specialized classification heads. Our architecture uniquely models both the mitotic figure phenotype and the instance difficulty simultaneously. This method is specifically designed to handle the challenges of diverse tissue types, scanner variability, and imbalanced data. We employed focal loss to effectively mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505 +/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/- 0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the potential to support precise prognostic assessments in clinical practice and improve consistency in pathological diagnosis.</description>

      <title>FireGNN: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Neural Networks with Trainable Fuzzy Rules for Interpretable Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Psychiatric Disorder Detection via Self-supervised Learning on Frequency-enhanced Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychiatric disorders involve complex neural activity changes, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data serving as key diagnostic evidence. However, data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information pose significant challenges. While graph-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have shown promise in brain network analysis, they primarily focus on time-domain representations, often overlooking the rich information embedded in the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose Frequency-Enhanced Network (FENet), a novel SSL framework specially designed for fMRI data that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information to improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets. FENet constructs multi-view brain networks based on the inherent properties of fMRI data, explicitly incorporating frequency information into the learning process of representation. Additionally, it employs domain-specific encoders to capture temporal-spectral characteristics, including an efficient frequency-domain encoder that highlights disease-relevant frequency features. Finally, FENet introduces a domain consistency-guided learning objective, which balances the utilization of diverse information and generates frequency-enhanced brain graph representations. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets demonstrate that FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong performance in minimal data conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between various frequency-domain features and psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the critical role of high-frequency information in disorder detection.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Ensemble Framework for Multi-Omics Dementia Biomarker Discovery Under HDLSS Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomarker discovery in neurodegenerative diseases requires robust, interpretable frameworks capable of integrating high-dimensional multi-omics data under low-sample conditions. We propose a novel ensemble approach combining Graph Attention Networks (GAT), MultiOmics Variational AutoEncoder (MOVE), Elastic-net sparse regression, and Storey's False Discovery Rate (FDR). This framework is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods including DIABLO, MOCAT, AMOGEL, and MOMLIN. We evaluate performance using both simulated multi-omics data and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our method demonstrates superior predictive accuracy, feature selection precision, and biological relevance. Biomarker gene maps derived from both datasets are visualized and interpreted, offering insights into latent molecular mechanisms underlying dementia.</description>

      <title>Automated Cervical Os Segmentation for Camera-Guided, Speculum-Free Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical cancer is highly preventable, yet persistent barriers to screening limit progress toward elimination goals. Speculum-free devices that integrate imaging and sampling could improve access, particularly in low-resource settings, but require reliable visual guidance. This study evaluates deep learning methods for real-time segmentation of the cervical os in transvaginal endoscopic images. Five encoder-decoder architectures were compared using 913 frames from 200 cases in the IARC Cervical Image Dataset, annotated by gynaecologists. Performance was assessed using IoU, DICE, detection rate, and distance metrics with ten-fold cross-validation. EndoViT/DPT, a vision transformer pre-trained on surgical video, achieved the highest DICE (0.50 \pm 0.31) and detection rate (0.87 \pm 0.33), outperforming CNN-based approaches. External validation with phantom data demonstrated robust segmentation under variable conditions at 21.5 FPS, supporting real-time feasibility. These results establish a foundation for integrating automated os recognition into speculum-free cervical screening devices to support non-expert use in both high- and low-resource contexts.</description>

      <title>Language-based Color ISP Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for tuning the parameters of a color adjustment Image Signal Processor (ISP) algorithmic "block" using language prompts. This enables the user to impart a particular visual style to the ISP-processed image simply by describing it through a text prompt. To do this, we first implement the ISP block in a differentiable manner. Then, we define an objective function using an off-the-shelf, pretrained vision-language model (VLM) such that the objective is minimized when the ISP processed image is most visually similar to the input language prompt. Finally, we optimize the ISP parameters using gradient descent. Experimental results demonstrate tuning of ISP parameters with different language prompts, and compare the performance of different pretrained VLMs and optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD) and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from unqueried ones.</description>

      <title>Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10 percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms.</description>

      <title>The Microwave Rainbow: How Geometry Paints Colours in Microwave Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave vision from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides an all-weather, day-and-night capability to observe Earth, yet much of the information encoded in its signals remains undeciphered. Recent high-resolution imagery has revealed a striking phenomenon: man-made structures systematically appear in a spectrum of colours, the physical origin of which has been an open question. Here we show that this effect, which we term the microwave rainbow, is a form of geometric dispersion arising from structures acting as intrinsic diffraction gratings. We introduce a geometric-physical model that provides a direct analytical link between a target's geometry and its observed colour signature. This model quantitatively explains the full range of signatures, from continuous colour gradients on curved surfaces (zero-order diffraction) to repeating spectral patterns from periodic structures (high-order diffraction). This work transforms colour from a visual artefact into a precise measure of physical form, enabling the geometry of both critical infrastructure and natural phenomena to be mapped directly from space. Our findings establish the physical basis for a new remote sensing modality: microwave colour vision, and open a new frontier in how we perceive our world.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness, mobility, and safety. However, current AI research often treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation, we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework designed for both ultrasound image classification and segmentation. Trained on a large-scale dataset containing more than 9,700 annotations across seven different anatomical regions, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets with lower computational overhead. Our model weights and codes are available at https://github.com/yyxl123/UltraUPConvNet</description>

      <title>EMeRALDS: Electronic Medical Record Driven Automated Lung Nodule Detection and Classification in Thoracic CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to delayed diagnosis and poor early detection. This study aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) for the accurate detection and classification of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans.
  Methods: We propose an end-to-end CAD pipeline consisting of two modules: (i) a detection module (CADe) based on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in which the standard visual prompt is replaced with a text prompt encoded by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), and (ii) a diagnosis module (CADx) that calculates similarity scores between segmented nodules and radiomic features. To add clinical context, synthetic electronic medical records (EMRs) were generated using radiomic assessments by expert radiologists and combined with similarity scores for final classification. The method was tested on the publicly available LIDC-IDRI dataset (1,018 CT scans).
  Results: The proposed approach demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot lung nodule analysis. The CADe module achieved a Dice score of 0.92 and an IoU of 0.85 for nodule segmentation. The CADx module attained a specificity of 0.97 for malignancy classification, surpassing existing fully supervised methods.
  Conclusions: The integration of VLMs with radiomics and synthetic EMRs allows for accurate and clinically relevant CAD of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. The proposed system shows strong potential to enhance early lung cancer detection, increase diagnostic confidence, and improve patient management in routine clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Impact of a Sharpness Based Loss Function for Removing Out-of-Focus Blur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has explored complex loss functions for deblurring. In this work, we explore the impact of a previously introduced loss function - Q which explicitly addresses sharpness and employ it to fine-tune State-of-the-Art (SOTA) deblurring models. Standard image quality metrics such as PSNR or SSIM do not distinguish sharpness from ringing. Therefore, we propose a novel full-reference image quality metric Omega that combines PSNR with Q. This metric is sensitive to ringing artefacts, but not to a slight increase in sharpness, thus making it a fair metric for comparing restorations from deblurring mechanisms. Our approach shows an increase of 15 percent in sharpness (Q) and up to 10 percent in Omega over the use of standard losses.</description>

      <title>EyeNexus: Adaptive Gaze-Driven Quality and Bitrate Streaming for Seamless VR Cloud Gaming Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) cloud gaming systems render the 3D graphics on cloud servers for playing graphically demanding games on VR headsets. Delivering high-resolution game scenes is challenging due to variation in network performance. By leveraging the non-uniform human vision perception, foveated rendering and encoding have proven effective for optimized streaming in constrained networks. SoTA foveation methods either do not incorporate real-time gaze data or are unable to handle variations in network conditions, resulting in a suboptimal user experience. We introduce EyeNexus, a pioneering system that combines real-time gaze-driven spatial compression (FSC) with gaze-driven video encoding (FVE), transforming the gaze point for precise alignment and foveation. We propose a novel foveation model that dynamically adjusts the foveation region based on real-time bandwidth and gaze data. The model simplifies network-aware quality assignment in FVE, ensuring smooth and imperceptible quality gradients. We evaluate EyeNexus using objective and subjective measures with different network conditions and games. EyeNexus reduces latency by up to 70.9% and improves perceptual visual quality by up to 24.6%. Our IRB-approved user study shows that EyeNexus achieves the highest playability and visual quality, with improvements of up to 48%, while eliminating motion sickness.</description>

Abstract: To select suitable filters for a task or to improve existing filters, a deep understanding of their inner workings is vital. Diffusion echoes, which are space-adaptive impulse responses, are useful to visualise the effect of nonlinear diffusion filters. However, they have received little attention in the literature. There may be two reasons for this: Firstly, the concept was introduced specifically for diffusion filters, which might appear too limited. Secondly, diffusion echoes have large storage requirements, which restricts their practicality. This work addresses both problems. We introduce the filter echo as a generalisation of the diffusion echo and use it for applications beyond adaptive smoothing, such as image inpainting, osmosis, and variational optic flow computation. We provide a framework to visualise and inspect echoes from various filters with different applications. Furthermore, we propose a compression approach for filter echoes, which reduces storage requirements by a factor of 20 to 100.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Smile Design: Personalized Dental Aesthetics Outcomes Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A healthy smile plays a significant role in functional as well as esthetic considerations, improving confidence. It is difficult for dental professionals to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements. Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however, susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental practice.</description>

      <title>MAE-SAM2: Mask Autoencoder-Enhanced SAM2 for Clinical Retinal Vascular Leakage Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>Introduction to a Low-Cost AI-Powered GUI for Unstained Cell Culture Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.</description>

      <title>MindVL: Towards Efficient and Effective Training of Multimodal Large Language Models on Ascend NPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs. Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers, which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators. MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase, multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.</description>

      <title>Sphere-GAN: a GAN-based Approach for Saliency Estimation in 360{\deg} Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and, consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed for 360{\deg} saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN, a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately predicting saliency maps.</description>

      <title>ResWCAE: Biometric Pattern Image Denoising Using Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utilization of biometric authentication with pattern images is increasingly popular in compact Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the reliability of such systems can be compromised by image quality issues, particularly in the presence of high levels of noise. While state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms designed for generic image denoising have shown promise, their large number of parameters and lack of optimization for unique biometric pattern retrieval make them unsuitable for these devices and scenarios. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight and robust deep learning architecture, the Residual Wavelet-Conditioned Convolutional Autoencoder (Res-WCAE) with a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) regularization, designed specifically for fingerprint image denoising. Res-WCAE comprises two encoders - an image encoder and a wavelet encoder - and one decoder. Residual connections between the image encoder and decoder are leveraged to preserve fine-grained spatial features, where the bottleneck layer conditioned on the compressed representation of features obtained from the wavelet encoder using approximation and detail subimages in the wavelet-transform domain. The effectiveness of Res-WCAE is evaluated against several state-of-the-art denoising methods, and the experimental results demonstrate that Res-WCAE outperforms these methods, particularly for heavily degraded fingerprint images in the presence of high levels of noise. Overall, Res-WCAE shows promise as a solution to the challenges faced by biometric authentication systems in compact IoT devices.</description>

      <title>Automatic quality control in multi-centric fetal brain MRI super-resolution reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quality control (QC) has long been considered essential to guarantee the reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal brain MRI, where acquisitions and image processing techniques are less standardized than in adult imaging. In this work, we focus on automated quality control of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) volumes of fetal brain MRI, an important processing step where multiple stacks of thick 2D slices are registered together and combined to build a single, isotropic and artifact-free T2 weighted volume. We propose FetMRQC$_{SR}$, a machine-learning method that extracts more than 100 image quality metrics to predict image quality scores using a random forest model. This approach is well suited to a problem that is high dimensional, with highly heterogeneous data and small datasets. We validate FetMRQC$_{SR}$ in an out-of-domain (OOD) setting and report high performance (ROC AUC = 0.89), even when faced with data from an unknown site or SRR method. We also investigate failure cases and show that they occur in $45\%$ of the images due to ambiguous configurations for which the rating from the expert is arguable. These results are encouraging and illustrate how a non deep learning-based method like FetMRQC$_{SR}$ is well suited to this multifaceted problem. Our tool, along with all the code used to generate, train and evaluate the model are available at https://github.com/Medical-Image-Analysis-Laboratory/fetmrqc_sr/ .</description>

      <title>Regist3R: Incremental Registration with Stereo Foundation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction has remained an essential yet challenging problem in the field of computer vision. While DUSt3R and its successors have achieved breakthroughs in 3D reconstruction from unposed images, these methods exhibit significant limitations when scaling to multi-view scenarios, including high computational cost and cumulative error induced by global alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Regist3R, a novel stereo foundation model tailored for efficient and scalable incremental reconstruction. Regist3R leverages an incremental reconstruction paradigm, enabling large-scale 3D reconstructions from unordered and many-view image collections. We evaluate Regist3R on public datasets for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that Regist3R achieves comparable performance with optimization-based methods while significantly improving computational efficiency, and outperforms existing multi-view reconstruction models. Furthermore, to assess its performance in real-world applications, we introduce a challenging oblique aerial dataset which has long spatial spans and hundreds of views. The results highlight the effectiveness of Regist3R. We also demonstrate the first attempt to reconstruct large-scale scenes encompassing over thousands of views through pointmap-based foundation models, showcasing its potential for practical applications in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks, including urban modeling, aerial mapping, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Comparing Conditional Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Contrast-Enhanced Breast MRI from Pre-Contrast Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of 22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings. Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4 MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our codebase at https://github.com/sebastibar/conditional-diffusion-breast-MRI.</description>

      <title>DLF: Extreme Image Compression with Dual-generative Latent Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in extreme image compression have achieved remarkable performance by compressing the tokens from generative tokenizers. However, these methods often prioritize clustering common semantics within the dataset, while overlooking the diverse details of individual objects. Consequently, this results in suboptimal reconstruction fidelity, especially at low bitrates. To address this issue, we introduce a Dual-generative Latent Fusion (DLF) paradigm. DLF decomposes the latent into semantic and detail elements, compressing them through two distinct branches. The semantic branch clusters high-level information into compact tokens, while the detail branch encodes perceptually critical details to enhance the overall fidelity. Additionally, we propose a cross-branch interactive design to reduce redundancy between the two branches, thereby minimizing the overall bit cost. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive reconstruction quality of DLF even below 0.01 bits per pixel (bpp). On the CLIC2020 test set, our method achieves bitrate savings of up to 27.93% on LPIPS and 53.55% on DISTS compared to MS-ILLM. Furthermore, DLF surpasses recent diffusion-based codecs in visual fidelity while maintaining a comparable level of generative realism. Project: https://dlfcodec.github.io/</description>

      <title>OSDM-MReg: Multimodal Image Registration based One Step Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing image registration aligns images from different sensors for data fusion and analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to extract modality-invariant features when faced with large nonlinear radiometric differences, such as those between SAR and optical images. To address these challenges, we propose OSDM-MReg, a novel multimodal image registration framework that bridges the modality gap through image-to-image translation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step unaligned target-guided conditional diffusion model (UTGOS-CDM) to translate source and target images into a unified representation domain. Unlike traditional conditional DDPM that require hundreds of iterative steps for inference, our model incorporates a novel inverse translation objective during training to enable direct prediction of the translated image in a single step at test time, significantly accelerating the registration process. After translation, we design a multimodal multiscale registration network (MM-Reg) that extracts and fuses both unimodal and translated multimodal images using the proposed multimodal fusion strategy, enhancing the robustness and precision of alignment across scales and modalities. Extensive experiments on the OSdataset demonstrate that OSDM-MReg achieves superior registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>
