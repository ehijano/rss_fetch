      <title>Generalized autocorrelation function in the family of deterministic and stochastic anomalous diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02989v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observables of the one-dimensional model for anomalous transport in semiconductor devices where diffusion arises from scattering at dislocations at fixed random positions, known as L\'evy-Lorentz gas. Due to complex stochasticity in the system, direct investigations of such non-trivial dynamics are not possible; therefore, to gain insight into the microscopic properties, we use deterministic dynamics known as the Slicer Map and Fly-and-Die dynamics. We analytically derive the generalized position auto-correlation function of these dynamics and study the special case, the 3-point position correlation function. For this, we derive single parameter-dependent scaling and compare it with the numerically estimated 3-point position auto-correlation of the L\'evy-Lorentz gas, for which the analytical expression is still an open question. Here we obtained a remarkable agreement between them, irrespective of any functional relationship with time. Moreover, we demonstrate that the position moments and the position auto-correlations of these systems scale in the same fashion, provided the times are large enough and far enough apart. Other observables, such as velocity moments and correlations, are reported to distinguish the systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral Edge States Emerging on Anyon-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

      <title>Fock-space delocalization and the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution from dual-unitary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems are expected to quickly randomize any structured initial state, delocalizing it in Fock space. In this work, we study the spreading of an initial product state in Hilbert space under dual-unitary dynamics, captured by the inverse participation ratios and the distribution of overlaps (bit-string probabilities). We consider the self-dual kicked Ising model, a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos which can be seen as either a periodically driven Floquet model or a dual-unitary quantum circuit. Both analytically and numerically, we show that the inverse participation ratios rapidly approach their ergodic values, corresponding to those of Haar random states, and establish the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution for the overlap distribution. Importantly, this convergence happens exponentially fast in time, with a time scale that is independent of system size. We inspect the effect of local perturbations that break dual-unitarity and show a slowdown of the spreading in Fock space, indicating that dual-unitary circuits are maximally efficient at preparing random states.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Anisotropic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a widely observed state of fluid flows, characterized by complex, nonlinear interactions between motions across a broad spectrum of length and time scales. While turbulence is ubiquitous, from teacups to planetary atmospheres, oceans and stars, its manifestations can vary considerably between different physical systems. For instance, three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows display a forward energy cascade from large to small scales, while in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, energy cascades from small to large scales. In a given physical system, a transition between such disparate regimes of turbulence can occur when a control parameter reaches a critical value. The behavior of flows close to such transition points, which separate qualitatively distinct \textit{phases} of turbulence, has been found to be unexpectedly rich. Here, we survey recent findings on such transitions in highly anisotropic turbulent fluid flows, including turbulence in thin layers and under the influence of rapid rotation. We also review recent work on transitions induced by turbulent fluctuations, such as random reversals and transitions between large-scale vortices and jets, among others. The relevance of these results and their ramifications for future investigations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Templating Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an aggregation process based on \emph{templating}, where a specified number of constituent clusters must assemble on a larger aggregate, which serves as a scaffold, for a reaction to occur. A simple example is a dimer scaffold, upon which two monomers meet and create another dimer, while dimers and larger aggregates undergo in irreversible aggregation with mass-independent rates. In the mean-field approximation, templating aggregation has unusual kinetics in which the cluster and monomer densities, $c(t)$ and $m(t)$ respectively, decay with time as $c\sim m^2\sim t^{-2/3}$. These starkly contrast to the corresponding behaviors in conventional aggregation, $c\sim \sqrt{m}\sim t^{-1}$. We then treat three natural extensions of templating: (a) the reaction in which $L$ monomers meet and react on an $L$-mer scaffold to create two $L$-mers, (b) multistage scaffold reactions, and (c) templated ligation, in which clusters of all masses serve as scaffolds and binary aggregation is absent.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of stationarity for Bitcoin and the S&amp;P500</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compares and contrasts stationarity between the conventional stock market and cryptocurrency. The dataset used for the analysis is the intraday price indices of the S&amp;P500 from 1996 to 2023 and the intraday Bitcoin indices from 2019 to 2023, both in USD. We adopt the definition of `wide sense stationary', which constrains the time independence of the first and second moments of a time series. The testing method used in this paper follows the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem, i.e., that for a wide sense stationary process, the power spectral density and the autocorrelation are a Fourier transform pair. We demonstrate that localized stationarity can be achieved by truncating the time series into segments, and for each segment, detrending and normalizing the price return are required. These results show that the S&amp;P500 price return can achieve stationarity for the full 28-year period with a detrending window of 12 months and a constrained normalization window of 10 minutes. With truncated segments, a larger normalization window can be used to establish stationarity, indicating that within the segment the data is more homogeneous. For Bitcoin price return, the segment with higher volatility presents stationarity with a normalization window of 60 minutes, whereas stationarity cannot be established in other segments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling, has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. We provide an extended detailed balance criterion for shooting methods. We affirm detailed balance for most TPS methods, but the new criteria reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.</description>

      <title>Path-integral calculation of the third dielectric virial coefficient of helium based on ab initio three-body polarizability and dipole surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a surface for the electric dipole moment of three interacting helium atoms and use it, together with state-of-the-art potential and polarizability surfaces, to compute the third dielectric virial coefficient, $C_\varepsilon$, for both $^4$He and $^3$He isotopes. Our results agree with previously published data computed using an approximated form for the three-body polarizability, and are extended to the low-temperature regime by including exchange effects. Additionally, the uncertainty of $C_\varepsilon$ is rigorously determined for the first time by propagating the uncertainties of the potential and polarizability surfaces; this uncertainty is much larger than the contribution from the dipole-moment surface to $C_\varepsilon$. Our results compare reasonably well with the limited experimental data. The first-principles values of $C_\epsilon$ computed in this work will enhance the accuracy of primary temperature and pressure metrology based on measurements of the dielectric constant of helium.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensing of Stark weak field under the influence of Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localization-delocalization transition can be leveraged as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization-delocalization transition potentials one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the ground state of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper (AAH) localization-delocalization transition. We consider the single-particle system and the system at half-filling. Our work reveals that the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers a superior scaling with respect to the system size in comparison to the pure stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimentally measuring fidelity-based QFI in a many-body system poses significant challenges. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provides a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Heat production in a stochastic system with nonlinear time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.</description>

Abstract: We derive an exact formula for the corner free-energy contribution of weakly-anisotropic two-dimensional critical systems in the Ising universality class on rectangular domains, expressed in terms of quantities that specify the anisotropic fluctuations. The resulting expression agrees with numerical exact calculations that we perform for the anisotropic triangular Ising model and quantifies the nonuniversality of the corner term for anisotropic critical two-dimensional systems. Our generic formula is expected to apply also to other weakly-anisotropic critical two-dimensional systems that allow for a conformal field theory description in the isotropic limit. We consider the three-states and four-states Potts models as further specific examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental uncertainty prompted the early development of the quantum uncertainty relations now known as speed limits. However, it has not yet been a part of the development of thermodynamic speed limits on dissipation. Here, we predict the maximal rates of heat and entropy production using experimentally accessible uncertainties in a thermodynamic speed limit. Because these rates can be difficult to measure directly, we reparametrize the speed limit to predict these observables indirectly from quantities that are readily measurable with experiments. From this transformed speed limit, we identify the resolution an experiment will need to upper bound nonequilibrium rates. Without models for the dynamics, these speed limit predictions agree with calorimetric measurements of the energy dissipated by a pulled Brownian particle and a microtubule active gel, validating the approach and suggesting potential for the design of experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Cooperativity, information gain, and energy cost during early LTP in dendritic spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.</description>

Abstract: The confinement-induced resonances for trapped bosons in the cigar-shaped and pancake geometries are studied within the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equations, which are a simplified version of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. Although the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method is considered applicable only for small interparticle interactions, the resonance denominators for the chemical potential are obtained in both quasi-one and quasi-two dimensions. A useful integral representation of the one-particle Green's function are found for the cylindrical confinement. We find the position of a smoothed resonance for the chemical potential in the pancake geometry at positive scattering length.</description>

Abstract: Adiabatic preparation of a critical ground state is hampered by the closing of its energy gap as the system size increases. However, this gap is directly relevant only for a uniform ramp, where a control parameter in the Hamiltonian is tuned uniformly in space towards the quantum critical point. Here, we consider inhomogeneous ramps in two dimensions: initially, the parameter is made critical at the center of a lattice, from where the critical region expands at a fixed velocity. In the 1D and 2D quantum Ising models, which have a well-defined speed of sound at the critical point, the ramp becomes adiabatic with a subsonic velocity. This subsonic ramp can prepare the critical state faster than a uniform one. Moreover, in both a model of $p$-wave paired 2D fermions and the Kitaev model, the critical dispersion is anisotropic -- linear with a nonzero velocity in one direction and quadratic in the other -- but the gap is still inversely proportional to the linear size of the critical region, with a coefficient proportional to the nonzero velocity. This suffices to make the inhomogeneous ramp adiabatic below a finite crossover velocity and superior to the homogeneous one.</description>
