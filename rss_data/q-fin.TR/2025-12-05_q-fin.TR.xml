      <title>FX Market Making with Internal Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the FX markets continue to evolve, many institutions have started offering passive access to their internal liquidity pools. Market makers act as principal and have the opportunity to fill those orders as part of their risk management, or they may choose to adjust pricing to their external OTC franchise to facilitate the matching flow. It is, a priori, unclear how the strategies managing internal liquidity should depend on market condions, the market maker's risk appetite, and the placement algorithms deployed by participating clients. The market maker's actions in the presence of passive orders are relevant not only for their own objectives, but also for those liquidity providers who have certain expectations of the execution speed. In this work, we investigate the optimal multi-objective strategy of a market maker with an option to take liquidity on an internal exchange, and draw important qualitative insights for real-world trading.</description>

      <title>Partial multivariate transformer as a tool for cryptocurrencies time series prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting cryptocurrency prices is hindered by extreme volatility and a methodological dilemma between information-scarce univariate models and noise-prone full-multivariate models. This paper investigates a partial-multivariate approach to balance this trade-off, hypothesizing that a strategic subset of features offers superior predictive power. We apply the Partial-Multivariate Transformer (PMformer) to forecast daily returns for BTCUSDT and ETHUSDT, benchmarking it against eleven classical and deep learning models. Our empirical results yield two primary contributions. First, we demonstrate that the partial-multivariate strategy achieves significant statistical accuracy, effectively balancing informative signals with noise. Second, we experiment and discuss an observable disconnect between this statistical performance and practical trading utility; lower prediction error did not consistently translate to higher financial returns in simulations. This finding challenges the reliance on traditional error metrics and highlights the need to develop evaluation criteria more aligned with real-world financial objectives.</description>

      <title>Risk aversion of insider and dynamic asymmetric information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a Kyle-Back model with a risk-averse insider possessing exponential utility and a dynamic stochastic signal about the asset's terminal fundamental value. While the existing literature considers either risk-neutral insiders with dynamic signals or risk-averse insiders with static signals, we establish equilibrium when both features are present. Our approach imposes no restrictions on the magnitude of the risk aversion parameter, extending beyond previous work that requires sufficiently small risk aversion. We employ a weak conditioning methodology to construct a Schr\"{o}dinger bridge between the insider's signal and the asset price process, an approach that naturally accommodates stochastic signal evolution and removes risk aversion constraints.
  We derive necessary conditions for equilibrium, showing that the optimal insider strategy must be continuous with bounded variation. Under these conditions, we characterize the market-maker pricing rule and insider strategy that achieve equilibrium. We obtain explicit closed-form solutions for important cases including deterministic and quadratic signal volatilities, demonstrating the tractability of our framework.</description>

      <title>Visibility-Graph Asymmetry as a Structural Indicator of Volatility Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volatility clustering is one of the most robust stylized facts of financial markets, yet it is typically detected using moment-based diagnostics or parametric models such as GARCH. This paper shows that clustered volatility also leaves a clear imprint on the time-reversal symmetry of horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed on absolute returns in physical time. For each time point, we compute the maximal forward and backward visibility distances, $L^{+}(t)$ and $L^{-}(t)$, and use their empirical distributions to build a visibility-asymmetry fingerprint comprising the Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance, variance difference, entropy difference, and a ratio of extreme visibility spans. In a Monte Carlo study, these HVG asymmetry features sharply separate volatility-clustered GARCH(1,1) dynamics from i.i.d.\ Gaussian noise and from randomly shuffled GARCH series that preserve the marginal distribution but destroy temporal dependence; a simple linear classifier based on the fingerprint achieves about 90\% in-sample accuracy. Applying the method to daily S\&amp;P500 data reveals a pronounced forward--backward imbalance, including a variance difference $\Delta\mathrm{Var}$ that exceeds the simulated GARCH values by two orders of magnitude and vanishes after shuffling. Overall, the visibility-graph asymmetry fingerprint emerges as a simple, model-free, and geometrically interpretable indicator of volatility clustering and time irreversibility in financial time series.</description>
