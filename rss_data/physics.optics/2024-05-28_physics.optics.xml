      <title>Cross-polarized stimulated Brillouin scattering empowered photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of cross-polarized stimulated Brillouin scattering (XP-SBS) with Kerr and quadratic nonlinearities in lithium niobate (LN) to enhance photonic device performance. Three novel applications are demonstrated: (i) a reconfigurable stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL) with 0.7-Hz narrow linewidth and 40-nm tunability, enabled by XP-SBS's thermo-optic phase matching; (ii) an efficient coherent mode converter achieving 55% conversion efficiency via intracavity Brillouin-enhanced four-wave mixing; (iii) a Brillouin-quadratic laser and frequency comb operational in near-infrared and visible bands, benefiting from the interaction between XP-SBS and quadratic nonlinearity. These advancements promise significant improvements in photonic technologies, including narrow-linewidth laser, microcomb generation, and optical signal processing, paving the way for more robust and versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Observation of perovskite topological valley exciton-polaritons at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological exciton-polaritons are a burgeoning class of topological photonic systems distinguished by their hybrid nature as part-light, part-matter quasiparticles. Their further control over novel valley degree of freedom (DOF) has offered considerable potential for developing active topological optical devices towards information processing. However, the experimental demonstration of propagating topological exciton-polaritons with valley DOF remains elusive at room temperature. Here, employing a two-dimensional (2D) valley-Hall perovskite lattice, we report the experimental observation of valley-polarized topological exciton-polaritons and their valley-dependent propagations at room temperature. The 2D valley-Hall perovskite lattice consists of two mutually inverted honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry. By measuring their band structure with angle-resolved photoluminescence spectra, we experimentally verify the existence of valley-polarized polaritonic topological kink states with a large gap opening of ~ 9 meV in the bearded interface at room temperature. Moreover, these valley-polarized states exhibit counter-propagating behaviors under a resonant excitation at room temperature. Our results not only expand the landscape of realizing topological exciton-polaritons, but also pave the way for the development of topological valleytronic devices employing exciton-polaritons with valley DOF at room temperature</description>

      <title>Intensity adaptive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optics (AO) is a powerful tool used in a wide range of research areas spanning from aerospace to microscopy. To date, AO has largely been applied to optical phase aberration correction, with recent advances extending to include the vectorial properties of light. However, intensity errors widely exist in optical systems, yet their associated correction methods are still very much in their infancy. Here, we propose a new adaptive optics method that is termed intensity adaptive optics (I-AO), which features a dual-feedback loop for intensity aberration correction that addresses both intensity uniformity and the overall intensity. We demonstrate that I-AO can operate in both sensor-based and sensorless regimes and validate its feasibility by quantitatively analysing the quality of the focus of an aberrated optical system. This technique expands the AO toolkit, broadens its scope of application, and opens a new avenue for next-generation AO innovations.</description>

      <title>Thousand foci coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy with 1089 foci, enabled by a high repetition rate amplified oscillator and optical parametric amplifier. We employ a camera as multichannel detector to acquire and separate the signals from the foci, rather than using the camera image itself. This allows to retain the insensitivity of the imaging to sample scattering afforded by the non-linear excitation point-spread function, which is the hallmark of point-scanning techniques. We show frame rates of 0.3Hz for a megapixel CARS image, limited by the camera used. The laser source and corresponding CARS signal allows for at least 1000 times higher speed, and using faster cameras would allow acquiring at that speed, opening a perspective to megapixel CARS imaging with more than 100Hz frame rate.</description>

      <title>Space-time non-separable dynamics of ultrashort vortex pulse with power exponential spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort optical pulses with orbital angular momentum (OAM) owing to their various applications in classical as well as quantum domains attract a lot of research attention. The evolution of their spatio-temporal dynamics is of particular interest. In the present work, we numerically explore the spatio-temporal evolution of ultrashort Laguerre Gauss (LG) vortex with power exponential spectrum, also called power exponential (PE) pulse, in dispersive and nonlinear media. The study in particular addresses space-time non-separability in vortex pulses in ultra-short domain. The study reveals the spatio-temporal, spectral and chirp evolution patterns of ultrashort vortex vary differently across different spatial regions. The pulse dynamics exhibits asymmetric evolution and splitting in the spatio-temporal plane. Moreover, we observe compression in the spatio-temporal plane at trailing edge of the pulse with increase in the strength of the nonlinearity. Similar evolution is observed with propagation distance. In weak nonlinear regime, a redshift in spectrum is noted as we move radially outward from the bright caustic of LG vortex while a blue shifted spectrum emerges on approaching towards the phase singularity. Interestingly, as the pulse furthers in the medium, nonlinearity induced trends in spectral shift is witnessed. With stronger nonlinearity, a complex spectral evolution is observed. Furthermore, we study the evolution of frequency chirp with propagation distance both with weak and strong nonlinearities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate high-power thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) erbium-doped waveguide amplifier (EDWA) with a maximum on-chip output power of 113 mW and a gain of 16 dB. The on-chip integrated EDWA is composed of large mode area (LMA) waveguide structures with a total length of 7 cm and a footprint of 1x1 cm2. Particularly, we connect segmented LMA waveguides with waveguide tapers to achieve on-chip mode conversion which maintains single-mode propagation all over the EDWA even at the waveguide bends. The design leads to significant increase of the amplified signal power by orders of magnitude and will open an avenue for applications such as on-chip high-power lasers and amplifiers system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the fundamental principles of light-matter interaction are well-understood and drive countless technologies, the world of multiphoton processes remains a fascinating puzzle, holding the potential to drastically alter our understanding of how light interacts with matter at its most basic level. This rich interplay of light and matter unveils novel phenomena that can be harnessed for sensing with exceptional precision, as exemplified by multiphoton quantum sensing. This thesis delves into the applications of multiphoton quantum protocols, particularly in imaging, communication, and plasmonic sensing, to surpass classical limitations and achieve enhanced sensitivity. We explore the potential of multiphoton quantum processes, particularly in the nanoscale regime and within subsystems of macroscopic systems, where novel and ultra-sensitive sensing methodologies emerge. Subsequent chapters of this thesis demonstrate the transformative potential of multiphoton quantum sensing, elucidating the design, implementation, and experimental results of specific sensing protocols tailored to diverse applications. Our analysis combines experimental observations and theoretical predictions to assess the sensitivity and performance of these protocols. Additionally, the thesis discusses potential future directions and advancements in the field, envisioning applications in biomolecule detection, environmental monitoring, and fundamental studies of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Concluding reflections highlight the implications of multiphoton quantum sensing across scientific disciplines and lay the groundwork for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Inverse Design of Multi-bit Programmable Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging reconfigurable metasurfaces offer various possibilities in programmatically manipulating electromagnetic waves across spatial, spectral, and temporal domains, showcasing great potential for enhancing terahertz applications. However, they are hindered by limited tunability, particularly evident in relatively small phase tuning over 270o, due to the design constraints with time-intensive forward design methodologies. Here, we demonstrate a multi-bit programmable metasurface capable of terahertz beam steering, facilitated by a developed physics-informed inverse design (PIID) approach. Through integrating a modified coupled mode theory (MCMT) into residual neural networks, our PIID algorithm not only significantly increases the design accuracy compared to conventional neural networks but also elucidates the intricate physical relations between the geometry and the modes. Without decreasing the reflection intensity, our method achieves the enhanced phase tuning as large as 300o. Additionally, we experimentally validate the inverse designed programmable beam steering metasurface, which is adaptable across 1-bit, 2-bit, and tri-state coding schemes, yielding a deflection angle up to 68o and broadened steering coverage. Our demonstration provides a promising pathway for rapidly exploring advanced metasurface devices, with potentially great impact on communication and imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>ChiSCAT: unsupervised learning of recurrent cellular micro-motion patterns from a chaotic speckle pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that action potentials are accompanied by "intrinsic optical signals", such as a nanometer-scale motion of the cell membrane. Here we present ChiSCAT, a technically simple imaging scheme that detects such signals with interferometric sensitivity. ChiSCAT combines illumination by a {\bf ch}aotic speckle pattern and interferometric scattering microscopy ({\bf iSCAT}) to sensitively detect motion in any point and any direction. The technique features reflective high-NA illumination, common-path suppression of vibrations and a large field of view. This approach maximizes sensitivity to motion, but does not produce a visually interpretable image. We show that unsupervised learning based on matched filtering and motif discovery can recover underlying motion patterns and detect action potentials. We demonstrate these claims in an experiment on blebbistatin-paralyzed cardiomyocytes. ChiSCAT promises to even work in scattering tissue, including a living brain.</description>

      <title>Strategies to enhance THz harmonic generation combining multilayered, gated, and metamaterial-based architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has unique properties paving the way for groundbreaking future applications. Its large optical nonlinearity and ease of integration in devices notably makes it an ideal candidate to become a key component for all-optical switching and frequency conversion applications. In the terahertz (THz) region, various approaches have been independently demonstrated to optimize the nonlinear effects in graphene, addressing a critical limitation arising from the atomically thin interaction length. Here, we demonstrate sample architectures that combine strategies to enhance THz nonlinearities in graphene-based structures. We achieve this by increasing the interaction length through a multilayered design, controlling carrier density with an electrical gate, and modulating the THz field spatial distribution with a metallic metasurface substrate. Our study specifically investigates third harmonic generation (THG) using a table-top high-field THz source. We measure THG enhancement factors exceeding thirty and propose architectures capable of achieving a two-order-of-magnitude increase. These findings highlight the potential of engineered graphene-based samples in advancing THz frequency conversion technologies for signal processing and wireless communication applications.</description>

      <title>Digital Signal Processing Techniques for Noise Characterization of Lasers and Optical Frequency Combs: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing noise characterizations of lasers and optical frequency combs on sampled and digitized data offers numerous advantages compared to analog measurement techniques. One of the main advantages is that the measurement setup is greatly simplified. Only a balanced detector followed by an analog-to-digital converter is needed, allowing all the complexity to be moved to the digital domain. Secondly, near-optimal phase estimators are efficiently implementable, providing accurate phase noise estimation in the presence of the measurement noise. Finally, joint processing of multiple comb lines is feasible, enabling computation of phase noise correlation matrix, which includes all information about the phase noise of the optical frequency comb. This tutorial introduces a framework based on digital signal processing for phase noise characterization of lasers and optical frequency combs. The framework is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and automatic differentiation. The EKF is a near-optimal estimator of the optical phase in the presence of measurement noise, making it very suitable for phase noise measurements. Automatic differentiation is key to efficiently optimizing many parameters entering the EKF framework. More specifically, the combination of EKF and automatic differentiation enables the efficient optimization of phase noise measurement for optical frequency combs with arbitrarily complex noise dynamics that may include many free parameters. We show the framework's efficacy through simulations and experimental data, showcasing its application across various comb types and in dual-comb measurements, highlighting its accuracy and versatility. Finally, we discuss its capability for digital phase noise compensation, which is highly relevant to free-running dual-comb spectroscopy applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-precise, sub-picometer tunable free spectral range in a parabolic microresonator induced by optical fiber bending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonic (SNAP) microresonators are fabricated on silica optical fibers, leveraging silica's outstanding material and mechanical properties. These properties allow for precise control over the microresonator dimension, shape, and mode structure, a key feature for reconfigurable photonic circuits. Such circuits find applications in high-speed communications, optical computing, and optical frequency combs (OFC). However, consistently producing SNAP microresonators with equally spaced eigenmodes has remained challenging. In this study, we introduce a method to create a SNAP microresonator with a parabolic profile. We accomplish this by bending a silica optical fiber in a controlled manner using two linear stages. This approach achieves a uniform free spectral range (FSR) as narrow as 1 pm across more than 45 modes. We further demonstrate that the FSR of the SNAP microresonator can be continuously adjusted over a range nearly as wide as one FSR itself, specifically from 1.09 pm to 1.72 pm, with a precision of +/-0.01 pm and high repeatability. Given its compact size and tuning capability, this SNAP microresonator is highly promising for various applications, including the generation of tunable low-repetition-rate OFC and delay lines.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Third Harmonic Generation in Two-Dimensional Tin Sulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-plane anisotropic properties of two-dimensional (2D) group IV monochalcogenides provide an additional degree of freedom which can be used in future optoelectronic devices. Here, it is shown that the third harmonic generation (THG) signal produced by ultrathin tin (II) sulfide (SnS) is in-plane anisotropic with respect to the incident linear polarization of the laser field. We fit the experimental polarization-resolved THG (P-THG) measurements with a nonlinear optics model, which accounts for the orthorhombic crystal structure of 2D SnS. We calculate the relative magnitudes of the \{chi}^(3) tensor components by recording and simultaneously fitting both orthogonal components of the P-THG intensity. Furthermore, we introduce a THG anisotropy ratio, whose calculated values compare the total THG intensity when the excitation linear polarization is along the armchair crystallographic direction with the case when it is along the zigzag direction. Our results provide quantitative information on the anisotropic nature of the THG process in SnS, paving the way to a better understanding of anisotropic nonlinear light-matter interactions, and the development of polarization-sensitive nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Large-scale time-multiplexed nanophotonic parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of nonlinear resonators offer a fertile ground for a wide range of complex phenomena and opportunities for advanced photonic sensing and computing. Recently, significant attention has focused on studying coupled resonators in special-purpose configurations either on chips or in table-top experiments. However, a path to realizing a large-scale programmable network of nonlinear photonic resonators remains elusive because of the challenges associated with simultaneously achieving strong nonlinearity, independent operation of the resonators, and programmability of the couplings. In this work, we break these barriers by realizing large-scale, time-multiplexed optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) on a single lithium niobate nanophotonic chip. We show independent operation of 70 identical OPOs in an ultrafast nanophotonic circuit. The OPOs exhibit an ultra-low threshold of a few picojoules, substantially surpassing the strength of nonlinearity of other platforms. Using our ultrafast nanophotonic circuit, a network of N OPOs with programmable all-to-all couplings requires only a few additional components. The time-multiplexed nanophotonic OPOs can enable myriad applications, including ultrafast classical and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Significance: Pulsatile blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2 ) via pulse oximetry is a valuable clinical metric for assessing oxygen delivery. Individual anatomical features, including skin tone, may affect current optical pulse oximetry methods.
  Aim: Develop an optical pulse oximetry method based on Dual-Ratio (DR) measurements to suppress individual anatomical features on SpO2.
  Approach: Design a DR-based finger pulse oximeter, hypothesizing that DR would suppress confounds from optical coupling and superficial tissue-absorption. This method is tested using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and in vivo experiments.
  Results: Different melanosome volume fraction in the epidermis, a surrogate for skin tone, cause changes in the recovered SpO2 on the order of 1%. Different heterogeneous pulsatile hemodynamics cause greater changes on the order of 10%. SpO2 recovered with DR measurements showed less variability than the traditional Single-Distance (SD) transmission method.
  Conclusions: For the models and methods considered here, SpO2 measurements are more strongly impacted by heterogeneous pulsatile hemodynamics than by melanosome volume fraction. This is consistent with previous reports that, the skin tone bias is smaller than the observed variation in recovered SpO 2 across individual people. The partial suppression of variability in the SpO2 recovered by DR suggests promise of DR for pulse oximetry.</description>

      <title>Exciton Transport Coherent with Upper and Lower Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the strong exciton-cavity coupling regime, exciton polaritons play a pivotal role in governing exciton transport. However, the specific contributions of the two branches of polaritons to exciton current remain unexplored. Here, we decompose the exciton current operator into components coherent with the upper and lower polaritons. Subsequently, we employ the quantum master equation to investigate the exciton current coherent with these two polariton branches. Our findings reveal that in the blue detuning regime, where the optical frequency exceeds the molecular excitation energy, the contribution of the exciton current coherent with the lower polariton is more pronounced. Conversely, in the red detuning regime, where the optical frequency is lower than the molecular excitation energy, the contribution of the exciton current coherent with the upper polariton prevails. We elucidate two critical factors influencing these contributions: firstly, the ratio of excitons to photons in the polariton branches. Due to the smaller decay rate of molecules compared to that of the cavity, the polariton branch with a higher proportion of excitons contributes more to coherent exciton current. Secondly, the energy gap between the polariton branch and the dark states; a smaller energy difference in a branch provides a larger contribution to coherent exciton current.</description>

      <title>Gain-loss-engineering: a new platform for extreme anisotropic thermal photon tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel approach to achieving anisotropic thermal photon tunneling, inspired by the concept of parity-time symmetry in quantum physics. Our method leverages the modulation of constitutive optical parameters, oscillating between loss and gain regimes. This modulation reveals a variety of distinct effects in thermal photon behavior and dispersion. Specifically, we identify complex tunneling modes through gain-loss engineering, which include thermal photonic defect states and Fermi-arc-like phenomena, which surpass those achievable through traditional polariton engineering. Our research also elucidates the laws governing the evolution of radiative energy in the presence of gain and loss interactions, and highlights the unexpected inefficacy of gain in enhancing thermal photon energy transport compared to systems characterized solely by loss. This study not only broadens our understanding of thermal photon tunneling but also establishes a versatile platform for manipulating photon energy transport, with potential applications in thermal management, heat science, and the development of advanced energy devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of crystal symmetries and Weyl nodes on high-harmonic generation in Weyl semimetal TaAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) offers an all-optical approach to discern structural symmetries through its selection rules and probe topological phases with its spectral signatures. Here we develop a universal theoretical framework -- the Jones matrix formalism -- establishing the fundamental relationship between pulse-crystal shared symmetries and HHG selection rules. Applying this to the Weyl semimetal (WSM) material TaAs, shows that the anomalous harmonics excited by linearly and circularly polarized pulses are governed respectively by the shared twofold and fourfold rotational symmetries of laser pulses and lattice, rather than the topology of Weyl nodes. The common observables of HHG, including intensity, circular dichroism, ellipticity dependence, and carrier-envelope phase dependence, are not found to carry a signature of the Weyl cones. This insight into TaAs can be extended to other WSMs, indicating that HHG is not a particularly effective tool for investigating the topological features of WSMs. However, the Jones matrix formalism lays the groundwork for both HHG probing crystal symmetry and controlling harmonic polarization states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction in quantum materials presents a new paradigm as light can tip the balance between many competing quantum many-body phases to result in new phenomena. Describing the optical response of such materials requires complex models. Here, we develop a non-local model to describe the optical response of a quantum material, 1T-TaS$_2$. 1T-TaS$_2$ is a nearly commensurate charge-density-wave material at room temperature. The competing stacking configurations of the charge domains in this layered material result in significant optical inhomogeneity that necessitates a non-local dielectric function. We experimentally measure the non-local optical response of 1T-TaS$_2$ films under various illumination intensities and validate our model. The non-local parameter extracted from our measurements sheds light on the competition between the two stacking configurations of 1T-TaS$_2$. Our technique of measuring non-local optical response serves as a quick, simple, and non-invasive method to probe the energy landscape of strong correlations in many such quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel light-matter platform that uses complex-valued oscillator networks, a form of physical neural networks, to identify dominant subnetworks and uncover indirect correlations within larger networks. This approach offers significant advantages, including low energy consumption, high processing speed, and the immediate identification of co- and counter-regulated nodes without post-processing. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through its application to biological networks, and we also propose its applicability to a wide range of other network types.</description>

Abstract: Optical solitons have long been of interest both from a fundamental perspective and because of their application potential. Both cubic (Kerr) and quadratic nonlinearities can lead to soliton formation, but quadratic solitons can practically benefit from stronger nonlinearity and achieve substantial wavelength conversion. However, despite their rich physics, quadratic cavity solitons have been used only for broadband frequency comb generation, especially in the mid-IR. Here, we show that the formation dynamics of mid-IR quadratic cavity solitons can be effectively leveraged to enhance molecular sensing. We demonstrate significant sensitivity enhancement while circumventing constraints of traditional cavity enhancement mechanisms. We perform experiments sensing CO$_2$ using quadratic cavity solitons around 4 $\mu$m and achieve an equivalent path length enhancement of 6000. Additionally, we demonstrate large sensitivity at high concentrations of CO$_2$, beyond what can be achieved using an equivalent high-finesse linear cavity by orders of magnitude. Our results highlight a path for utilizing quadratic cavity nonlinear dynamics and solitons for molecular sensing beyond what can be achieved using linear methods.</description>

Abstract: Physical and chemical properties of materials can be modified by a resonant optical mode. Such recent demonstrations have mostly relied on a planar cavity geometry, others have relied on a plasmonic resonator. However, the combination of these two device architectures have remained largely unexplored, especially in the context of maximizing light-matter interactions. Here, we investigate several schemes of electromagnetic field confinement aimed at facilitating the collective coupling of a localized photonic mode to molecular vibrations in the terahertz region. The key aspects are the use of metasurface plasmonic structures combined with standard Fabry-Perot configurations and the deposition of a thin layer of glucose, via a spray coating technique, within a tightly focused electromagnetic mode volume. More importantly, we demonstrate enhanced vacuum Rabi splittings reaching up to 200 GHz when combining plasmonic resonances, photonic cavity modes and low-energy molecular resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a cavity mode can be utilized to enhance the zero-point electric field amplitude of a plasmonic resonator. Our study provides key insight into the design of polaritonic platforms with organic molecules to harvest the unique properties of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Temporal coupled-mode theory in nonlinear resonant photonics: From basic principles to contemporary systems with 2D materials, dispersion, loss, and gain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) is an acclaimed and widely used theoretical framework for modeling the continuous wave (CW) response and temporal dynamics of any integrated or free-space photonic resonant structure. It was initially employed to understand how energy is coupled into and out of a cavity and how it is exchanged between different resonant modes. In the 30 years that followed its establishment, CMT has been expanded to describe a broad range of nonlinear interactions as well (self- and cross-phase modulation, saturable absorption, frequency generation, gain, etc.). In this tutorial, we thoroughly present the basic principles and the evolution of CMT throughout the years, showcasing its immense capabilities for the analysis and design of linear and nonlinear resonant photonic systems. Importantly, we focus on examples of modern, open nanophotonic resonators incorporating contemporary bulk or sheet (2D) materials that may be lossy and dispersive. For each linear/nonlinear effect under study we follow a meticulous, step-by-step approach, starting from an accurate model of the physical phenomenon and proceeding to its introduction in the CMT framework all the way to the efficient solution of the resulting system of equations. Our work highlights the merits of CMT as an efficient, accurate, and versatile theoretical tool. We envision that it can serve both as an introductory reference for any reader, as well as a comprehensive handbook on how to incorporate a broad range of linear and nonlinear effects in the CMT framework.</description>

Abstract: Microresonator frequency combs (microcombs) hold great potential for precision metrology within a compact form factor, impacting a wide range of applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, environmental monitoring, time-keeping, navigation and astronomy. Through the principle of self-injection locking, electrically-driven chip-based microcombs with minimal complexity are now feasible. However, phase-stabilisation of such self-injection-locked microcombs, a prerequisite for metrological frequency comb, has not yet been attained. Here, we address this critical need by demonstrating full phase-stabilisation of a self-injection-locked microcomb. The microresonator is implemented in a silicon nitride photonic chip, and by controlling a pump laser diode and a microheater with low voltage signals (less than 1.5 V), we achieve independent control of the comb's offset and repetition rate frequencies. Both actuators reach a bandwidth of over 100 kHz, enabling phase-locking of the microcomb to external frequency references. These results establish photonic chip-based, self-injection-locked microcombs as low-complexity yet versatile sources for coherent precision metrology in emerging applications.</description>

Abstract: Waveguide-based interferometric circuits are widely employed in optical communications, sensing and computing applications. In particular, glass-based devices are appealing due to the transparency and bio-compatibility of this substrate, or where low-loss interfacing with fiber networks is required. However, fast electro-optic phase modulation is hard to achieve in glass materials. Here, we demonstrate an optical phase and intensity modulator in glass, working in the megahertz range. This modulator exploits the elasto-optic effect inside a mechanical microstructure, brought to oscillation at resonance, and is entirely realized by femtosecond laser micromachining. In detail, we demonstrate 23-dB optical intensity modulation at 1.17 MHz, with an internal optical loss of the phase-modulator component as low as 0.04 dB.</description>

Abstract: Graphene-based terahertz (THz) devices have emerged as promising platforms for a variety of applications, leveraging graphene's unique optoelectronic properties. This review explores recent advancements in utilizing graphene in THz technology, focusing on two main aspects: THz molecular sensing and THz wave modulation. In molecular sensing, the environment-sensitive THz transmission and emission properties of graphene are utilized for enabling molecular adsorption detection and biomolecular sensing. This capability holds significant potential, from the detection of pesticides to DNA at high sensitivity and selectivity. In THz wave modulation, crucial for next-generation wireless communication systems, graphene demonstrates remarkable potential in absorption modulation when gated. Novel device structures, spectroscopic systems, and metasurface architectures have enabled enhanced absorption and wave modulation. Furthermore, techniques such as spatial phase modulation and polarization manipulation have been explored. From sensing to communication, graphene-based THz devices present a wide array of opportunities for future research and development. Finally, advancements in sensing techniques not only enhance biomolecular analysis but also contribute to optimizing graphene's properties for communication by enabling efficient modulation of electromagnetic waves. Conversely, developments in communication strategies inform and enhance sensing capabilities, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship.</description>

Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons from optical microresonators, commonly referred to as soliton microcombs, have been developed for a broad range of applications, including precision measurement, optical frequency synthesis, and ultra-stable microwave and millimeter wave generation, all on a chip. An important goal for microcombs is self referencing, which requires octave-spanning bandwidths to detect and stabilize the comb carrier envelope offset frequency. Further, detection and locking of the comb spacings are often achieved using frequency division by electro-optic modulation. The thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform, with its low loss, strong second- and third-order nonlinearity, as well as large Pockels effect, is ideally suited for these tasks. However, octave-spanning soliton microcombs are challenging to demonstrate on this platform, largely complicated by strong Raman effects hindering reliable fabrication of soliton devices. Here, we demonstrate entirely connected and octave-spanning soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate. With appropriate control over microresonator free spectral range and dissipation spectrum, we show that soliton-inhibiting Raman effects are suppressed, and soliton devices are fabricated with near-unity yield. Our work offers an unambiguous method for soliton generation on strongly Raman-active materials. Further, it anticipates monolithically integrated, self-referenced frequency standards in conjunction with established technologies, such as periodically poled waveguides and electro-optic modulators, on thin-film lithium niobate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the theoretical framework for understanding the sensing capabilities of optical fibers. We show the distinct advantage of polarization over phase in detecting subhertz environmental processes. Subsequently, we propose a scheme capable of extracting the spectrum of perturbations affecting a specific section at any position along an optical fiber by detecting the state of polarization of the backreflected light. We discuss two examples of earthquake detection and the detection of sea swells and ocean tides through the analysis of the state of polarization of an optical signal reconstructed by the receiver of a transoceanic cable, obtained from an online database.\cite{zhongwenzhan_2020} Finally, we provide the analytical expression for the cross-correlation of the polarization perturbations of two wavelength division multiplexed channels, and show that the analysis of the polarization correlations between adjacent channels can provide valuable insights into the localization of earthquakes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can show multi-resonant response with high Q-factors in the visible range due to multipole coupling. This work suggests that these collective resonances in all-dielectric metasurfaces can be modified if adjacent to an anisotropic liquid crystal medium, opening a new path toward the dynamic metasurface effects. Using numerical full-wave simulations and the multipole decomposition technique for reflection and transmission coefficients we study the influence of the surrounding anisotropic medium on the resonant response of metasurfaces composed of disk-shaped dielectric nanoparticles. First, we consider tuning and switching the resonances induced by the polarization of the incident beam in metasurfaces placed in a medium with different orientations of LC molecules. Secondly, we study the case when the tuning of resonances is carried out by applying an external voltage that changes the orientation of LC molecules and thereby changes the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of directly tuning the resonant response of dielectric metasurfaces in an anisotropic environment, which is important for the development of optical nanodevices with dynamic switching of functional modes in the visible range.</description>

Abstract: Metasurfaces with tunable functionalities are greatly desired for modern optical system and various applications. To increase the operating channels of polarization-multiplexed metasurfaces, we proposed a structure of N cascaded dual-channel metasurfaces to achieve 2^N electrically switchable functional channels without intrinsic noise or cross-talk. As proof of principles, we have implemented a 3-layer setup to achieve 8 channels. In success, we have demonstrated two typical functionalities of vortex beam generation with switchable topological charge of l=-3 ~ +4 or l=-1~ -8, and beam steering with the deflecting direction switchable in an 8*1 line or a 4*2 grid. We believe that our proposal would provide a practical way to significantly increase the scalability and extend the functionality of polarization-multiplexed metasurfaces, which are potential for the applications of LiDAR, glasses-free 3D display, OAM (de)multiplexing, and varifocal meta-lens.</description>

      <title>Dark excitons and hot electrons modulate exciton-photon strong coupling in metal-organic optical microcavities</title>

Abstract: Polaritons, formed as a result of strong hybridization of matter with light, are promising for important applications including organic solar cells, optical logic gates, and qubits. Owing to large binding energies of Frenkel excitons (matter), strong matter-light coupling phenomena are possible at room temperature, high exciton densities, and even with low-quality-factor microcavities. In such cases, due to polaritons' high degree of delocalization, simultaneous effects from dark excitons and hot electrons may affect performance of potential devices. Their understanding, therefore, is of paramount importance, but their disentanglement in optical spectroscopy, however, thus far remained unattainable. Here, we overcome this challenge by careful and systematic analysis of transient polaritonic spectra, supported by analytical models. In doing so, we conclude that dark excitons affect the strength of exciton-photon coupling and manifest themselves as Fano-like polaritonic gain-loss spectra. Free electrons add additional loss component to and imprint a two-temperature dynamics on the polaritonic response. The developed general methodology can be applied to a variety of other microcavity structures. Our findings are significant for distinguishing polaritons and other excitations in studies of polariton-electron and plasmon-electron coupling phenomena as well as photonic control over photophysical and photochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Vector Ising Spin Annealer for Minimizing Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector Ising Spin Annealer (VISA), a framework in gain-based computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes. Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Twisted charged particles in the uniform magnetic field with broken symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical description of charged particles with nonzero projection of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) in a uniform magnetic field with broken axial symmetry. The wave functions we find naturally account for the asymmetry of the magnetic field at the entrance of the solenoid through the continuous parameter and are a generalization of the Laguerre-Gauss states commonly used to describe twisted charged particles. We analyze the asymmetric Hamiltonian from an algebraic point of view and show how the OAM projection of the twisted state is modified by symmetry breaking. We provide analytical frameworks for properties of the asymmetric states, such as energy, RMS size, and Cazimir invariant, and discuss advantages of the proposed description.</description>

      <title>High fidelity distribution of triggered polarization-entangled telecom photons via a 36km intra-city fiber network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fiber-based distribution of triggered, entangled, single-photon pairs is a key requirement for the future development of terrestrial quantum networks. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for deterministic sources of on-demand polarization-entangled photon pairs. So far, the best QD polarization-entangled-pair sources emit in the near-infrared wavelength regime, where the transmission distance in deployed fibers is limited. Here, to be compatible with existing fiber network infrastructures, bi-directional polarization-conserving quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is employed to convert the QD emission from \unit[780]{nm} to telecom wavelengths. We show the preservation of polarization entanglement after QFC (fidelity to Bell state $F_{\phi^+, conv}=0.972\pm0.003$) of the biexciton transition. As a step towards real-world applicability, high entanglement fidelities ($F_{\phi^+, loop}=0.945\pm0.005$) after the propagation of one photon of the entangled pair along a \unit[35.8]{km} field installed standard single mode fiber link are reported. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate a second polarization-conversing QFC step back to \unit[780]{nm} preserving entanglement ($F_{\phi^+, back}=0.903\pm0.005$). This further prepares the way for interfacing quantum light to various quantum memories.</description>
