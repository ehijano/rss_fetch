      <title>Verified Certificates via SAT and Computer Algebra Systems for the Ramsey $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06055v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ramsey problem $R(3, k)$ seeks to determine the smallest value of $n$ such that any red/blue edge coloring of the complete graph on $n$ vertices must either contain a blue triangle (3-clique) or a red clique of size $k$. Despite its significance, many previous computational results for the Ramsey $R(3, k)$ problem such as $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ lack formal verification. To address this issue, we use the software MathCheck to generate certificates for Ramsey problems $R(3, 8)$ and $R(3, 9)$ (and symmetrically $R(8, 3)$ and $R(9, 3)$) by integrating a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver with a computer algebra system (CAS). Our SAT+CAS approach significantly outperforms traditional SAT-only methods, demonstrating an improvement of several orders of magnitude in runtime. For instance, our SAT+CAS approach solves $R(3, 8)$ (resp., $R(8, 3)$) sequentially in 59 hours (resp., in 11 hours), while a SAT-only approach using state-of-the-art CaDiCaL solver times out after 7 days. Additionally, in order to be able to scale to harder Ramsey problems $R(3, 9)$ and $R(9, 3)$ we further optimized our SAT+CAS tool using a parallelized cube-and-conquer approach. Our results provide the first independently verifiable certificates for these Ramsey numbers, ensuring both correctness and completeness of the exhaustive search process of our SAT+CAS tool.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Problems on Graphs Defined on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of graph problems on graphs defined on groups, especially power graphs. We observe that an isomorphism invariant problem, such as Hamiltonian Path, Partition into Cliques, Feedback Vertex Set, Subgraph Isomorphism, cannot be NP-complete for power graphs, commuting graphs, enhanced power graphs, directed power graphs, and bounded-degree Cayley graphs, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). An analogous result holds for isomorphism invariant group problems: no such problem can be NP-complete unless ETH is false. We show that the Weighted Max-Cut problem is NP-complete in power graphs. We also show that, unless ETH is false, the Graph Motif problem cannot be solved in quasipolynomial time on power graphs, even for power graphs of cyclic groups. We study the recognition problem of power graphs when the adjacency matrix or list is given as input and show that for abelian groups and some classes of nilpotent groups, it is solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>A simple layered-wheel-like construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in characterizing the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth and pathwidth. While this has recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open, and prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like obstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each branching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete subgraphs.
  There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather involved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our construction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be arbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and (c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has treewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several previously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most one satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c) simultaneously.
  In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that every graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must contain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction provides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to have arbitrarily large girth.</description>

      <title>Verification of Hamiltonian Path Conjecture (BHR Conjecture) for Integers up to p=31 based on one random multiset per FP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BHR (Buratti-Horak-Rosa) Conjecture (2006) proposes that for every p and a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers modulo p, there exists a Hamiltonian path in the Complete Graph Kp with consecutive edge lengths given by the elements of L. In this article, we outline an approach to the conjecture based on frequency partitions and local/global adjustment operations and backtracking. We describe the mathematical strategy, experimental evidence, and implementation in a Python Program to explore valid Hamiltonian paths p &lt; 37. This is a result an improvement over by Mariusz Meszka for all primes up to 23 (included) with the aid of a computer.</description>

      <title>On minimally tough chordal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00383v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Katona and Varga showed that for any rational number $t \in (1/2,1]$, no chordal graph is minimally $t$-tough, while Katona and Khan characterized all minimally $t$-tough, chordal graphs with $t \le 1/2$. We conjecture that no chordal graph is minimally $t$-tough for any $t&gt;1$ and prove several results supporting the conjecture. In particular, we show that for any $t&gt;1/2$, no strongly chordal graph is minimally $t$-tough%, no split graph is minimally $t$-tough, and no chordal graph with a universal vertex is minimally $t$-tough.</description>

      <title>An algorithm with a delay of $\mathcal{O}(k\Delta)$ for enumerating connected induced subgraphs of size $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of enumerating connected subgraphs of a given size in a graph has been extensively studied in recent years. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with a delay of $O(k\Delta)$ for enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of size $k$ in an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $k$ and $\Delta$ are respectively the size of subgraphs and the maximum degree of $G$. The algorithm requires a preprocessing step of $O(|V| + |E|)$ time to compute a depth-first search traversal order. The proposed algorithm improves upon the current best delay bound $O(k^2\Delta)$ for the connected induced subgraph enumeration problem in the literature.</description>

      <title>4-tangrams are 4-avoidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tangram is a word in which every letter occurs an even number of times. Thus it can be cut into parts that can be arranged into two identical words. The \emph{cut number} of a tangram is the minimum number of required cuts in this process. Tangrams with cut number one corresponds to squares. For $k\ge1$, let $t(k)$ denote the minimum size of an alphabet over which an infinite word avoids tangrams with cut number at most~$k$. The existence of infinite ternary square-free words shows that $t(1)=t(2)=3$. We show that $t(3)=t(4)=4$, answering a question from D\k{e}bski, Grytczuk, Pawlik, Przyby\l{}o, and \'Sleszy\'nska-Nowak.</description>

      <title>Exploring the unleaved tree of numerical semigroups up to a given genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$ and $n_{77}=47008818196495180$.</description>
