      <title>Interrupted time series analysis of clickbait on worldwide news websites, 2016-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clickbait is deceptive text that can manipulate web browsing, creating an information gap between a link and target page that literally baits a user into clicking. Clickbait detection continues to be well studied, but analyses of clickbait overall on the web are limited. A dataset was built consisting of 451,033,388 clickbait scores produced by a clickbait detector which analyzed links and headings on primarily English news pages from the Common Crawl. On this data, 5 segmented regression models were fit on 5 major news events and averaged clickbait scores. COVID and the 2020 US Election appeared to influence clickbait levels.</description>

      <title>Leading by the Nodes: A Survey of Film Industry Network Analysis and Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of network analysis research on the film industry, aiming to evaluate its emergence as a field of study and identify potential areas for further research. Many foundational network studies made use of the abundant data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) to test network methodologies. This survey focuses more specifically on examining research that employs network analysis to evaluate the film industry itself, revealing the social and business relationships involved in film production, distribution, and consumption. The paper adopts a classification approach based on node type and conducts network analyses of the reviewed literature, mapping citation and co-authorship networks. The findings provide insights into the structure and interconnectedness of the field, offering potential clusters of debates and shedding light on the institutional, geographical, and demographic characteristics shaping this field. In addition, this survey contributes to understanding film industry network analysis and informs researchers interested in network methods within the film industry and related cultural sectors.</description>

      <title>ComGPT: Detecting Local Community Structure with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), like GPT, have demonstrated the ability to understand graph structures and have achieved excellent performance in various graph reasoning tasks such as node classification. So far, how to leverage LLMs to better detect local communities remains underexplored. Local community detection algorithms based on seed expansion often face a seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. Using LLMs to solve existing local community work problems faces the following challenges: existing graph encoding methods fail to provide LLMs with sufficient community-related graph information; LLMs lack domain knowledge in mining communities. To address these issues, we improve graph encoding by supplementing community knowledge to enhance the ability of graph encoding to express graph information. Additionally, we design the NSG (Node Selection Guide) prompt to enhance LLMs' understanding of community characteristics, aiming to alleviate the seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. Based on the graph encoding and NSG prompt, we present a GPT-guided local community detection, called ComGPT. ComGPT iteratively selects potential nodes from the detected community's neighbors and subsequently employs GPT to choose the node that optimally integrates into the detected community from these selected potential nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that ComGPT outperforms the comparison algorithms, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the designed graph encoding and prompt.</description>

      <title>The Signatures of Ideal Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Ideal Flow Network (IFN) is a strongly connected network where relative flows are preserved (irreducible premagic matrix). IFN can be decomposed into canonical cycles to form a string code called network signature. A network signature can be composed back into an IFN by assignment and merging operations. Using string manipulations on network signatures, we can derive total flow, link values, sum of rows and columns, and probability matrices and test for irreducibility.</description>

      <title>Geotree of Geodetector: An Anatomy of Knowledge Diffusion of a Novel Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of citations to original publications highlighted their utility across academia, but the dissemination of knowledge from tacit conceptualization to scientific publications and its global applications remains understudied, and the prediction of knowledge trends in a disciplinary context is rare. Addressing the gaps, this paper constructed a tree-like hierarchical model (Geotree) to dissect the knowledge evolution paths of the Geodetector theory (a case) using the Web of Science citation database. Our results revealed that the knowledge evolution of 932 citations to Geodetector was partitioned into periods: a budding period of initial theoretical exploration, a growing period for emerging topics in application, and a mature period marked by significant citation growth. Our test R2 of the predicting model over the next decade, considering the tree-like hierarchy across research directions and disciplines, was 100% higher than that of the other two (from 0.29 to 0.58). The knowledge spreading, from China to North America in 2011, Europe in 2012, Oceania in 2017, South America in 2018, and Africa in 2019, was more associated with a country s production of scientific publications (q-statistic = 0.307***) than its income level. The Geotree modeling of two other cases from space science and physics confirmed the reliability of the source publication-based approach in tracking knowledge diffusion. Our established research framework enriched the current methodology of information science and provided valuable references for policymakers and scholars to enhance their decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Entendre, a Social Bot Detection Tool for Niche, Fringe, and Extreme Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social bots-automated accounts that generate and spread content on social media-are exploiting vulnerabilities in these platforms to manipulate public perception and disseminate disinformation. This has prompted the development of public bot detection services; however, most of these services focus primarily on Twitter, leaving niche platforms vulnerable. Fringe social media platforms such as Parler, Gab, and Gettr often have minimal moderation, which facilitates the spread of hate speech and misinformation. To address this gap, we introduce Entendre, an open-access, scalable, and platform-agnostic bot detection framework. Entendre can process a labeled dataset from any social platform to produce a tailored bot detection model using a random forest classification approach, ensuring robust social bot detection. We exploit the idea that most social platforms share a generic template, where users can post content, approve content, and provide a bio (common data features). By emphasizing general data features over platform-specific ones, Entendre offers rapid extensibility at the expense of some accuracy. To demonstrate Entendre's effectiveness, we used it to explore the presence of bots among accounts posting racist content on the now-defunct right-wing platform Parler. We examined 233,000 posts from 38,379 unique users and found that 1,916 unique users (4.99%) exhibited bot-like behavior. Visualization techniques further revealed that these bots significantly impacted the network, amplifying influential rhetoric and hashtags (e.g., #qanon, #trump, #antilgbt). These preliminary findings underscore the need for tools like Entendre to monitor and assess bot activity across diverse platforms.</description>

      <title>The News Comment Gap and Algorithmic Agenda Setting in Online Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disparity between news stories valued by journalists and those preferred by readers, known as the "News Gap", is well-documented. However, the difference in expectations regarding news related user-generated content is less studied. Comment sections, hosted by news websites, are popular venues for reader engagement, yet still subject to editorial decisions. It is thus important to understand journalist vs reader comment preferences and how these are served by various comment ranking algorithms that represent discussions differently. We analyse 1.2 million comments from Austrian newspaper Der Standard to understand the "News Comment Gap" and the effects of different ranking algorithms. We find that journalists prefer positive, timely, complex, direct responses, while readers favour comments similar to article content from elite authors. We introduce the versatile Feature-Oriented Ranking Utility Metric (FORUM) to assess the impact of different ranking algorithms and find dramatic differences in how they prioritise the display of comments by sentiment, topical relevance, lexical diversity, and readability. Journalists can exert substantial influence over the discourse through both curatorial and algorithmic means. Understanding these choices' implications is vital in fostering engaging and civil discussions while aligning with journalistic objectives, especially given the increasing legal scrutiny and societal importance of online discourse.</description>

      <title>Detectability of hierarchical communities in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.07525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of recovering a planted hierarchy of partitions in a network. The detectability of a single planted partition has previously been analysed in detail and a phase transition has been identified below which the partition cannot be detected. Here we show that, in the hierarchical setting, there exist additional phases in which the presence of multiple consistent partitions can either help or hinder detection. Accordingly, the detectability limit for non-hierarchical partitions typically provides insufficient information about the detectability of the complete hierarchical structure, as we highlight with several constructive examples.</description>

      <title>Bluesky: Network Topology, Polarization, and Algorithmic Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bluesky is a nascent Twitter-like and decentralized social media network with novel features and unprecedented data access. This paper provides a characterization of its interaction network, studying the political leaning, polarization, network structure, and algorithmic curation mechanisms of five million users. The dataset spans from the website's first release in February of 2023 to May of 2024. We investigate the replies, likes, reposts, and follows layers of the Bluesky network. We find that all networks are characterized by heavy-tailed distributions, high clustering, and short connection paths, similar to other larger social networks. Bluesky introduced feeds - algorithmic content recommenders created for and by users. We analyze all feeds and find that while a large number of custom feeds have been created, users' uptake of them appears to be limited. We analyze the hyperlinks shared by Bluesky's users and find no evidence of polarization in terms of the political leaning of the news sources they share. They share predominantly left-center news sources and little to no links associated with questionable news sources. In contrast to the homogeneous political ideology, we find significant issues-based divergence by studying opinions related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Two clear homophilic clusters emerge: Pro-Palestinian voices outnumber pro-Israeli users, and the proportion has increased. We conclude by claiming that Bluesky-for all its novel features - is very similar in its network structure to existing and larger social media sites and provides unprecedented research opportunities for social scientists, network scientists, and political scientists alike.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Node Representations for Real-World Complex Networks with Topological Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph augmentation methods play a crucial role in improving the performance and enhancing generalisation capabilities in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing graph augmentation methods mainly perturb the graph structures, and are usually limited to pairwise node relations. These methods cannot fully address the complexities of real-world large-scale networks, which often involve higher-order node relations beyond only being pairwise. Meanwhile, real-world graph datasets are predominantly modelled as simple graphs, due to the scarcity of data that can be used to form higher-order edges. Therefore, reconfiguring the higher-order edges as an integration into graph augmentation strategies lights up a promising research path to address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present Topological Augmentation (TopoAug), a novel graph augmentation method that builds a combinatorial complex from the original graph by constructing virtual hyperedges directly from the raw data. TopoAug then produces auxiliary node features by extracting information from the combinatorial complex, which are used for enhancing GNN performances on downstream tasks. We design three diverse virtual hyperedge construction strategies to accompany the construction of combinatorial complexes: (1) via graph statistics, (2) from multiple data perspectives, and (3) utilising multi-modality. Furthermore, to facilitate TopoAug evaluation, we provide 23 novel real-world graph datasets across various domains including social media, biology, and e-commerce. Our empirical study shows that TopoAug consistently and significantly outperforms GNN baselines and other graph augmentation methods, across a variety of application contexts, which clearly indicates that it can effectively incorporate higher-order node relations into the graph augmentation for real-world complex networks.</description>

      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) by Xie &amp; Zhou has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies by Gandica, Gargiulo, and Carletti has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both Schelling's and Xie &amp; Zhou's preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogenous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>
