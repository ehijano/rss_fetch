      <title>Simple systems of nonlinear recursions whose evolution is rather easily ascertained</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the solutions of certain systems of nonlinear \"Orst-order recursions with polynomial right-hand sides may be rather easily ascertained, and display interesting evolutions in their ticking time variable (taking integer values): for instance a remarkable kind of asymptotic periodicity.</description>

      <title>The elliptic lattice KdV system revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper [Nijhoff,Puttock,2003], a 2-parameter extension of the lattice potential KdV equation was derived, associated with an elliptic curve. This comprises a rather complicated 3-component system on the quad lattice which contains the moduli of the elliptic curve as parameters. In the present paper, we investigate this system further and, among other results, we derive a 2-component multiquartic form of the system on the quad lattice. Furthermore, we construct an elliptic Yang-Baxter map, and study the associated continuous and semi-discrete systems. In particular, we derive the so-called ``generating PDE'' for this system, comprising a 6-component system of second order PDEs which could be considered to constitute an elliptic extension of the Ernst equations of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear wave solution to a coupled mKdV equations with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear wave solutions to coupled mKdV equations with variable coefficients are obtained by using the F-expansion method, including 12 kinds of Jacobi elliptic function solutions. In the limit cases, the torsional wave solutions, periodic solutions and solitary wave solutions are obtained as well.</description>

      <title>Vector rogue wave patterns of the multi-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and generalized mixed Adler--Moser polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of high-order vector rogue wave (RW) solutions for any multi-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (denoted as $n$-NLSE) with multiple internal large parameters and reports some new RW patterns, including non-multiple root (NMR)-type patterns with shapes such as $ 180 $-degree sector, jellyfish-like, and thumbtack-like shapes, as well as multiple root (MR)-type patterns characterized by right double-arrow and right arrow shapes. We establish that these RW patterns are intrinsically related to the root structures of a novel class of polynomials, termed generalized mixed Adler--Moser (GMAM) polynomials, which feature multiple arbitrary free parameters. The RW patterns can be understood as straightforward expansions and slight shifts of the root structures for the GMAM polynomials to some extent. In the $(x,t)$-plane, they asymptotically converge to a first-order RW at the position corresponding to each simple root of the polynomials and to a lower-order RW at the position associated with each multiple root. Notably, the position of the lower-order RW within these patterns can be flexibly adjusted to any desired location in the $(x,t)$-plane by tuning the free parameters of the corresponding GMAM polynomials.</description>

      <title>General soliton solutions to the coupled Hirota equation via the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with various soliton solutions to the coupled Hirota equation, as well as to the Sasa-Satsuma equation which can be viewed as one reduction case of the coupled Hirota equation. First, we derive bright-bright, dark-dark, and bright-dark soliton solutions of the coupled Hirota equation by using the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili reduction method. Then, we present the bright and dark soliton solutions to the Sasa-Satsuma equation which are expressed by determinants of $N \times N$ instead of $2N \times 2N$ in the literature. The dynamics of first-, second-order solutions are investigated in detail. It is intriguing that, for the SS equation, the bright soliton for \(N=1\) is also the soliton to the complex mKdV equation while the amplitude and velocity of dark soliton for \(N=1\) are determined by the background plane wave. For \(N=2\), the bright soliton can be classified into three types: oscillating, single-hump, and two-hump ones while the dark soliton can be classified into five types: dark (single-hole), anti-dark, Mexican hat, anti-Mexican hat and double-hole. Moreover, the types of bright solitons for the Sasa-Satsuma equation can be changed due to collision.</description>
