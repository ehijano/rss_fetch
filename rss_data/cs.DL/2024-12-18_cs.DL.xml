      <title>NLLG Quarterly arXiv Report 09/24: What are the most influential current AI Papers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NLLG (Natural Language Learning &amp; Generation) arXiv reports assist in navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of NLP and AI research across cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.AI, and cs.LG categories. This fourth installment captures a transformative period in AI history - from January 1, 2023, following ChatGPT's debut, through September 30, 2024. Our analysis reveals substantial new developments in the field - with 45% of the top 40 most-cited papers being new entries since our last report eight months ago and offers insights into emerging trends and major breakthroughs, such as novel multimodal architectures, including diffusion and state space models. Natural Language Processing (NLP; cs.CL) remains the dominant main category in the list of our top-40 papers but its dominance is on the decline in favor of Computer vision (cs.CV) and general machine learning (cs.LG). This report also presents novel findings on the integration of generative AI in academic writing, documenting its increasing adoption since 2022 while revealing an intriguing pattern: top-cited papers show notably fewer markers of AI-generated content compared to random samples. Furthermore, we track the evolution of AI-associated language, identifying declining trends in previously common indicators such as "delve".</description>

      <title>Qibitz: Mining PubMed for Repurposable Drugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PubMed's current search interface makes it tedious to systematically search for medical and research literature on drugs that could potentially be used to treat a given pathology, including patients with genetically altered tumors. This is because physicians must search separately for each drug-pathology combination (or drug-gene combination). To streamline this process, this paper proposes adding a faceted search interface to PubMed. Faceted search is a common feature on e-commerce websites that allows users to filter search results by selecting different fields. By incorporating this technology, not only can physicians save time and improve the accuracy of their literature searches, but also presenting search results in this way makes patterns emerge, which can suggest new treatment options for a given pathology (including patients with genetically altered tumors).</description>

      <title>On the Readiness of Scientific Data for a Fair and Transparent Use in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To ensure the fairness and trustworthiness of machine learning (ML) systems, recent legislative initiatives and relevant research in the ML community have pointed out the need to document the data used to train ML models. Besides, data-sharing practices in many scientific domains have evolved in recent years for reproducibility purposes. In this sense, academic institutions' adoption of these practices has encouraged researchers to publish their data and technical documentation in peer-reviewed publications such as data papers. In this study, we analyze how this broader scientific data documentation meets the needs of the ML community and regulatory bodies for its use in ML technologies. We examine a sample of 4041 data papers of different domains, assessing their completeness, coverage of the requested dimensions, and trends in recent years. We focus on the most and least documented dimensions and compare the results with those of an ML-focused venue (NeurIPS D&amp;B track) publishing papers describing datasets. As a result, we propose a set of recommendation guidelines for data creators and scientific data publishers to increase their data's preparedness for its transparent and fairer use in ML technologies.</description>
