      <description>arXiv:2505.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and prove new geometric and algebraic characterisations for locations of constituent skyrmions, as well as their signed multiplicity, using Sutcliffe's JNR ansatz. Some low charge examples, and their similarity to BPS monopoles, are discussed. In addition, we provide Julia code for the further numerical study and visualisation of JNR skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Carrollian-holographic Derivation of BMS Flux-balance Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the BMS evolution equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects in asymptotically flat Einstein gravity follow from local Carroll, Weyl, and diffeomorphism invariance at the null conformal boundary, upon providing a minimalistic holographic dictionary as the sole input from the bulk. This result is a significant step in the quest for a flat-space holographic correspondence and offers a geometric implementation of the radiative degrees of freedom that source the boundary theory in the presence of bulk gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Stable non-linear evolution in regularised higher derivative effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of a recently proposed regularisation scheme to formulate the initial value problem for general (relativistic) effective field theories (EFTs) with arbitrary higher order equations of motion. We consider a simple UV theory that describes a massive and a massless scalar degree of freedom. Integrating out the heavy field gives rise to an EFT for the massless scalar. By adding suitable regularising terms to the EFT truncated at the level of dimension-$4$ and dimension-$6$ operators, we show that the resulting regularised theories admit a well-posed initial value problem. The regularised theories are related by a field redefinition to the original truncated EFTs and they propagate massive ghost fields (whose masses can be chosen to be of the order of the UV mass scale), in addition to the light field. We numerically solve the equations of motion of the UV theory and those of the regularised EFTs in $1+1$-dimensional Minkowski space for various choices of initial data and UV mass parameter. When derivatives of the initial data are sufficiently small compared to the UV mass scale, the regularised EFTs exhibit stable evolution in the computational domain and provide very accurate approximations of the UV theory. On the other hand, when the initial gradients of the light field are comparable to the UV mass scale, the effective field theory description breaks down and the corresponding regularised EFTs exhibit ghost-like/tachyonic instabilities. Finally, we also formulate a conjecture on the global nonlinear stability of the vacuum in the regularised scalar EFTs in $3+1$ dimensions. These results suggest that the regularisation approach provides a consistent classical description of the UV theory in a regime where effective field theory is applicable.</description>

      <title>A new look at the $SU_2$ gauge monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $SU_2\times U_1$ scalar vector model with a scalar doublet $\varphi$ is reviewed for the study of possible magnetic monopole solution. An eigenvalue equation $\hat n^a \sigma^a \varphi_\pm =\pm \varphi_\pm$ is shown to induce a set of monopole solutions specified by the unit vector $\hat n$. It is shown clearly that monopole solution has to do with the eigenvalue equation and an unique covariant combination of the non-abelian gauge field. It is also shown that a new set of monopole solutions is presented as a generalization of the monopole solutions known as Cho-Maison monopole. We also show that the EM field and field tensor defined by CM solution is effectively the same as the effective covariant field tensor introduced in this paper. Possible implication is also discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum contribution to domain wall tension from spectral methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In field theory, domain walls are constructed by embedding localized field configurations varying in one space dimension, such as the $\phi^4$ kink, in two or three space dimensions. At the classical level, the kink mass straightforwardly turns into the energy per unit length or area, known as the domain wall tension. The quantum contribution to the tension is more difficult to compute, because the quantum fluctuations about the domain wall in the additional coordinates must be included. We show that spectral methods, making use of scattering data for the interaction of quantum fluctuations with the domain wall background, are an efficient way to compute the leading quantum correction to the domain wall tension. In particular we demonstrate that within this approach it is straightforward to pass from one renormalization scheme to another.</description>

      <title>Brief overview of Candidate de Sitter Vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review compactifications of type IIB string theory which produce de Sitter vacua to leading order in the $\alpha^\prime$ and $g_s$ expansions in line with the scenario proposed by Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, and Trivedi. We detail specific Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications incorporating the non-perturbative superpotential from Euclidean D3-branes, the full flux-induced superpotential, and the K\"ahler potential evaluated at string tree level but retaining all orders in $\alpha'$. Each model hosts a Klebanov-Strassler throat featuring a single anti-D3-brane. The energy associated with this supersymmetry-breaking source, computed at leading order in $\alpha'$, lifts the minimum to a metastable de Sitter vacuum with all moduli stabilised. A key open challenge is the identification of vacua that remain stable when including additional corrections; an endeavour for which this study provides a solid foundation. This work is a contribution to the proceedings of the Corfu Summer Institute 2024 "School and Workshops on Elementary Particle Physics and Gravity" (CORFU2024) and is based on arXiv:2406.13751.</description>

      <title>On the deep string spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These proceedings are based on the author's invited talk reviewing the original published work [1,2] of the author with collaborators. The subject matter is a new, covariant and efficient technology of constructing entire trajectories of physical string states deeper inside the string spectrum than the leading Regge. The key observation behind the technology is that the lowering operators of a symplectic algebra appear in the Virasoro constraints which impose physicality of states in the open bosonic string. This algebra commutes with the spacetime Lorentz algebra, (of the little group) of which all string states are irreducible representations. Employing then the so-called Howe duality of representation theory, one may relate the irreducible representations of the two algebras via a bijection. The spectrum thus splits into two parts: trajectories that are lowest weight states of the symplectic algebra and their infinitely many clones. The latter can then be reached by suitably dressing the former with the raising operators of the symplectic algebra. The technology is nontrivially extended to the open superstring, where the relevant Howe dual is an orthosymplectic algebra.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>

      <title>On the total derivative divergence for a nonminimal vector operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the calculation of the total derivative $\cx R$ term in the divergence of vacuum effective action for the nonminimal vector field operator in a curved space background. This term led to an interesting discussions in the literature, in particular because it defines the local part of anomaly-induced effective action in conformal quantum gravity and may be decisive for the renormalizability of this theory. The divergent term of our interest was previously derived several times. One of the main results is that the mentioned local term is gauge-fixing dependent in the case of electromagnetic field, that contradicts the general theorems about quantum corrections. We perform the derivation by using Riemann's normal coordinates and confirm the previous results. The discussion includes the possible role of the gauge-dependent IR regulators and the related ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory - Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Zeta Function Ramp at the Black Hole Thouless Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole normal modes have intriguing connections to logarithmic spectra, and the spectral form factor (SFF) of $E_n = \log n$ is the mod square of the Riemann zeta function (RZF). In this paper, we first provide an analytic understanding of the dip-ramp-plateau structure of RZF and show that the ramp at $\beta \equiv \Re(s)=0$ has a slope precisely equal to 1. The $s=1$ pole of RZF can be viewed as due to a Hagedorn transition in this setting, and Riemann's analytic continuation to $\Re(s)&lt; 1$ provides the quantum contribution to the truncated $\log n$ partition function. This perspective yields a precise definition of RZF as the ''full ramp after removal of the dip'', and allows an unambiguous determination of the Thouless time. For black hole microstates, the Thouless time is expected to be $\mathcal{O}(1)$--remarkably, the RZF also exhibits this behavior. To our knowledge, this is the first black hole-inspired toy model that has a demonstrably $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Thouless time. In contrast, it is $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ in the SYK model and expected to be $\mathcal{O}(N^{\#})$ in supergravity fuzzballs. We trace the origins of the ramp to a certain reflection property of the functional equation satisfied by RZF, and suggest that it is a general feature of $L$-functions--we find evidence for ramps in large classes of $L$-functions. As an aside, we also provide an analytic determination of the slopes of (non-linear) ramps that arise in power law spectra using Poisson resummation techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fully supersymmetric solutions in N=3 and N=4 higher derivative Poincare supergravity theories. We work in the superconformal formalism and show that flat space is the only fully supersymmetric solution in these theories. However, in N=2 Poincare supergravity, three fully supersymmetric solutions exist: Bertotti-Robinson geometry ($AdS_2\times S^2$), flat space and pp wave spacetimes, which are known in the literature. We discuss the reason behind the richer vacua in N=2 supergravity compared to its N=3 and N=4 cousins.</description>

      <title>Simple Holography in General Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Here we furnish a definition in arbitrary spacetimes: given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal light-sheets. We show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other throat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the generalized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as a special case.
  The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the simple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Emergent photons and mechanisms of confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in 4D as prototypical models of systems with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-$\textit{form symmetry}$. For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions, the $\textit{monopoles}$, proliferate.</description>

      <title>Goofy is the new Normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the recently discovered global $\textit{goofy}$ transformations and conclude that their understanding is mandatory to describe the renormalization group (RG) fixed point structure of quantum field theories (QFTs) in general. Originally, goofy transformations were identified in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), where their surprisingly RG stable parameter relations do not correspond to any $\textit{regular}$ symmetry. We unveil several new goofy transformations and their associated RG fixed points, which we have explicitly checked to be RG invariant to three-loop order in gauge-, and scalar quantum corrections. We give a general argument as to why the implied parameter relations are RG invariant to all orders, even though the corresponding goofy transformations are explicitly broken by the gauge-kinetic terms. Goofy transformations can prohibit bare scalar mass parameters and give rise to generation-dependent sensitivity on relative signs of gauge couplings, for what reason they may have important applications for the electroweak hierarchy problem and the Standard Model flavor puzzle. We also discuss the relevance of goofy-symmetric RG fixed points for a phenomenon of "dynamical classicalization" in QFT.</description>

      <title>Zero curvature is a necessary and sufficient condition for a spin-orbital decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been an extended debate regarding the existence of a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular momentum of photons and other massless particles. It was recently shown that there are both geometric and topological obstructions preventing any such decomposition. Here we show that any geometric connection on a particle's state space induces a splitting of the angular momentum into two operators. These operators are well-defined angular momentum operators if and only if the connection has zero curvature. Massive particles have two canonical curved connections corresponding to boosts and rotations, respectively. These can be uniquely combined to produce a flat connection, and this gives a novel derivation of the Newton-Wigner position operator and the corresponding spin and orbital angular momenta for relativistic massive particles. When the mass is taken to zero, transverse boosts and rotations degenerate, leaving only a single connection for massless particles. This connection produces a commonly proposed splitting of the massless angular momentum into two operators. However, the connection is not flat, explaining why these operators do not satisfy the angular momentum commutation relations and are thus not true spin and orbital angular momentum operators.</description>

      <title>Shadow and geometric scattering analysis of a new black hole with magnetic charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a newly charged black hole with magnetic charge $q$ and coupling constant $\mu$ from the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics theory inspired by quasi-topological terms. We perform the shadow and geometric scattering analysis of this black hole. For $\mu=0.01$, we have four solution branches labelled by $2\pm$, 3, and 4 of the horizon, while there exists a single branch labelled by 2 for $\mu=0.1$. There is the naked singularity (NS) arisen from the magnetic charge extension of the photon spheres for the 3 and 4-branches. In case of $q&lt;1$, shadow radii of the $2$-branch with $\mu$=0.01 and 0.1 are the same as that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, while the 3-NS branch of $q&gt;1$ is constrained by the EHT observation. The geometric scattering analysis is performed to understand the peculiar forms of the critical impact factors.</description>

      <title>Aganagic's invariant is Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the Coulomb branch of a quiver gauge theory, there is a family of functions parameterized by choices of points in the punctured plane. Aganagic has predicted that Khovanov homology can be recovered from the braid group action on Fukaya-Seidel categories arising from monodromy in said space of potentials. These categories have since been rigorously studied, and shown to contain a certain (combinatorially defined) category on which Webster had previously constructed a (combinatorially defined) braid group action from which the Khovanov homology can be recovered.
  Here we show, by a direct calculation, that the aforementioned containment intertwines said combinatorially defined braid group action with the braid group action arising naturally from monodromy. This provides a mathematical verification that Aganagic's proposal gives a symplectic construction of Khovanov homology -- with both gradings, and over the integers.</description>

      <title>Can We Probe Spacetime Non-commutativity Through Tidal Deformability of Compact Objects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of spacetime non-commutativity on the tidal deformability of compact objects and explore the feasibility of detecting non-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We considered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge theory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While several types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing spacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study showed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their surface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their tidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness limit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute the NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several different models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing the results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness regimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be amplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction dominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the black-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars are not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while relying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parton structure of the nucleon and pion is investigated in an exploratory model that allows one to assess whether the dressing of quarks can, by itself, produce realistic gluon contributions to light-cone momentum fractions, gravitational form factors, mass/energy distributions and their radii. The model is the Dyson-Schwinger Equations in Rainbow-Ladder truncation. For the parton mass/energy distributions as a function of momentum transfer, we directly calculate matrix elements of the Energy-Momentum Tensor by utilizing its similarity to the momentum fraction moment of GPDs associated with deep inelastic scattering. A variety of gravitational form factors are obtained including the D-term.</description>

      <title>Strange correlator and string order parameter for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases in 1+1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.</description>

Abstract: Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy Problem is not a formal problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation -- the explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson. Without the solution to this problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Scaffolded Gluons and the Combinatorial Origins of Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new formulation for Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes in any number of dimensions and at any loop order, based on the same combinatorial and binary-geometric ideas in kinematic space recently used to give an all-order description of Tr $\phi^3$ theory. We propose that in a precise sense the amplitudes for a suitably "stringy" form of these two theories are identical, up to a simple shift of kinematic variables. This connection is made possible by describing the amplitudes for $n$ gluons via a "scalar scaffolding", arising from the scattering of $2n$ colored scalars coming in $n$ distinct pairs of flavors fusing to produce the gluons. Fundamental properties of the "$u$-variables", describing the "binary geometry" for surfaces appearing in the topological expansion, magically guarantee that the kinematically shifted Tr $\phi^3$ amplitudes satisfy the physical properties needed to be interpreted as scaffolded gluons. These include multilinearity, gauge invariance, and factorization on tree- and loop- level gluon cuts. Our "stringy" scaffolded gluon amplitudes coincide with amplitudes in the bosonic string for extra-dimensional gluon polarizations at tree-level, but differ (and are simpler) at loop-level. We provide many checks on our proposal, including matching non-trivial leading singularities through two loops. The simple counting problem underlying the $u$ variables autonomously "knows" about everything needed to convert colored scalar to gluon amplitudes, exposing a striking "discovery" of Yang-Mills amplitudes from elementary combinatorial ideas in kinematic space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

Abstract: We highlight the need for global completion of the field content in the M5-brane sigma-model analogous to Dirac's charge/flux quantization, and we point out that the superspace Bianchi identities on the worldvolume and on its ambient supergravity background constrain the M5's flux-quantization law to be in a non-abelian cohomology theory rationally equivalent to a twisted form of co-Homotopy. In order to clearly bring out this subtle point we give a streamlined re-derivation of the worldvolume 3-flux via M5 "super-embeddings". Finally, assuming the flux-quantization law to actually be in co-Homotopy ("Hypothesis H") we show how this implies Skyrmion-like solitons on general M5-worldvolumes and (abelian) anyonic solitons on the boundaries of "open M5-branes" in heterotic M-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to define a canonical loop integrand for non-supersymmetric gluon scattering amplitudes in the planar limit. Naive integrands are inflicted with $1/0$ ambiguities associated with tadpoles and massless external bubbles, which destroy integrand-level gauge invariance as well as consistent on-shell factorization on single loop-cuts. In this letter, we show that this essentially kinematical obstruction to defining "the" integrand for Yang-Mills theory has a structural solution, handed to us by the formulation of gluon amplitudes in terms of curves on surfaces. This defines "surface kinematics" generalizing momenta, making it possible to define "the" integrand satisfying both a (surface generalized) notion of gauge-invariance and consistent loop-cuts. The integrand also vanishes at infinity in appropriate directions, allowing it to be recursively computed for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in any number of dimensions. We illustrate these ideas through one loop for all multiplicity, and for the simplest two-loop integrand.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factors for curved spacetimes with horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral form factor is believed to exhibit a special type of behavior called ``dip-ramp-plateau'' in chaotic quantum systems that originates from random matrix theory. This suggests that the shape of the spectral form factor could serve as an indicator of chaos in various quantum systems. It has been shown recently that the dip-ramp-plateau structure appears in the spectral form factor when the normal modes of a massless scalar field theory in the brick-wall model of the BTZ black hole are treated as eigenvalues of a quantum Hamiltonian. At the same time, the level spacing distribution of these normal modes differs from that associated with random matrix theory ensembles. In this paper, we extend the results for BTZ background to the case of non-zero mass of the field, study the generalized spectral form-factor, and consider the same context for another non-trivial background -- de Sitter space. We compare the generalized spectral form factor for simple integrable quantum systems and for backgrounds with a horizon to the behavior predicted by random matrix theory. As a result, we confirm that BTZ and de Sitter brick-wall models are highly distinct integrable systems that exhibit the dip-ramp-plateau structure of the SFF but differ in the structure of the three-level generalized spectral form factor from the one predicted by random matrix theory. This raises the question on whether the DRP structure is an indicator of what is known as quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum corrections to the Euclidean path integral of charged and static four-dimensional de Sitter (dS$_4$) black holes near extremality. These black holes admit three different extremal limits (Cold, Nariai and Ultracold) which exhibit AdS$_2 \times S^2 $, dS$_2 \times S^2 $ and $\text{Mink}_2 \times S^2$ near horizon geometries, respectively. The one-loop correction to the gravitational path integral in the near horizon geometry is plagued by infrared divergencies due to the presence of tensor, vector and gauge zero modes. Inspired by the analysis of black holes in flat space, we regulate these divergences by introducing a small temperature correction in the Cold and Nariai background geometries. In the Cold case, we find a contribution from the gauge modes which is not present in previous work in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Several issues concerning the Nariai case, including the presence of negative norm states and negative eigenvalues, are discussed, together with problems faced when trying to apply this procedure to the Ultracold solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of the roots of a polynomial of degree $N$, when the polynomial itself is evolving according to the heat flow. We propose a general conjecture for the large-$N$ limit of this evolution. Specifically, we propose (1) that the log potential of the limiting root distribution should evolve according to a certain first-order, nonlinear PDE, and (2) that the limiting root distribution at a general time should be the push-forward of the initial distribution under a certain explicit transport map. These results should hold for sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.
  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a random matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem for the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix models. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is supported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect to time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE perspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE\ satisfied by the log potential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally converges to the desired PDE as $N\rightarrow \infty.$ We also present a "multiplicative" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.
  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the holomorphic moments.</description>

      <title>Integrating curved Yang-Mills gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02924v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a gauge theory based on principal bundles $\mathcal{P}$ equipped with a right $\mathcal{G}$-action, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a Lie group bundle instead of a Lie group. Due to the fact that a $\mathcal{G}$-action acts fibre by fibre, pushforwards of tangent vectors via a right-translation act now only on the vertical structure of $\mathcal{P}$. Thus, we generalize pushforwards using a connection on $\mathcal{G}$ which will modify the pushforward. A horizontal distribution on $\mathcal{P}$ invariant under such a modified pushforward will provide a proper notion of Ehresmann connection. For achieving gauge invariance we impose conditions on the connection 1-form $\mu$ on $\mathcal{G}$: $\mu$ has to be a multiplicative form, \textit{i.e.}\ closed w.r.t.\ a certain simplicial differential $\delta$ on $\mathcal{G}$, and the curvature $R_\mu$ of $\mu$ has to be $\delta$-exact with primitive $\zeta$; $\mu$ will be the generalization of the Maurer-Cartan form of the classical gauge theory, while the $\delta$-exactness of $R_\mu$ will generalize the role of the Maurer-Cartan equation. This introduces the notion of multiplicative Yang-Mills connections, a connection which helped classifying singular foliations and symmetry breaking. For allowing curved connections on $\mathcal{G}$ in the dynamical theory we will need to generalize the typical definition of the curvature/field strength $F$ on $\mathcal{P}$ by adding $\zeta$ to $F$.
  Several examples for a gauge theory with a curved $\mu$ will be provided, including the inner group bundle of the Hopf fibration $\mathbb{S}^7 \to \mathbb{S}^4$, and a classification for gauge theories with structural semisimple group bundles will be provided, including a classification for whether these theories admit a classical description.</description>

      <title>Linear Response Analysis of the Semiclassical Approximation to Spin 1/2 Quantum Electrodynamics in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An investigation of the validity of the semiclassical approximation to quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions is given. The criterion for validity used here involves the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through a two-point function which emerges naturally when considering the stability of the backreaction equation to linear order perturbations, resulting in the linear response equation. Consideration is given to the case of a spatially homogeneous electric field generated by a classical source, coupled to a quantized massive spin 1/2 field. Solutions to the linear response equation as well as the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through the current density two-point correlation function are presented for two relevant electric field-to-mass parameter values $qE/m^2$, indicative of the strength of the backreaction process. Previous efforts utilized approximate solutions to the linear response equation that were expected to be valid for early times. A comparative analysis is given between the exact and approximate solutions in order to validate this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Integral quantization based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Limits on Kaluza-Klein Portal Dark Matter Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenology of dark-matter (DM) scenarios within radius-stabilized Randall-Sundrum models. Specifically, we consider models where the dark matter candidates are Standard Model (SM) singlets confined to the TeV brane and interact with the SM via spin-2 and spin-0 gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We compute the thermal relic density of DM particles in these models by applying recent work showing that scattering amplitudes of massive spin-2 KK states involve an intricate cancellation between various diagrams. Considering the resulting DM abundance, collider searches, and the absence of a signal in direct DM detection experiments, we show that spin-2 KK portal DM models are highly constrained. We confirm that within the usual thermal freeze-out scenario, scalar dark matter models are essentially ruled out. In contrast, we show that fermion and vector dark matter models are viable in a region of parameter space in which dark matter annihilation through a KK graviton is resonant. Specifically, vector models are viable for dark matter masses ranging from 1.1 TeV to 5.5 TeV for theories in which the scale of couplings of the KK modes is of order 40 TeV or lower. Fermion dark matter models are viable for a similar mass region, but only for KK coupling scales of order 20 TeV. In this work, we provide a complete description of the calculations needed to arrive at these results and, in an appendix, a discussion of new KK-graviton couplings needed for the computations, which have not previously been discussed in the literature. Here, we focus on models in which the radion is light, and the back-reaction of the radion stabilization dynamics on the gravitational background can be neglected. The phenomenology of a model with a heavy radion and the consideration of the effects of the radion stabilization dynamics on the DM abundance are being addressed in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. Recent observations, e.g. DESI, have shown that the sound horizon-independent measurement of $H_0$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. On the one hand, imposing some prior from other cosmological probes is often used to strengthen the constraints on the results, however, these priors are usually derived using the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM, it is not suitable to apply these so-called $\Lambda$CDM priors (e.g., the $n_s$ prior from CMB), which would bias the results, to early new physics because these early new physics are usually accompanied by shifts of the $\Lambda$CDM parameters. On the other hand, the constraints on $H_0$ in the sound horizon-independent EFTofLSS analysis arise from not only the shape of the power spectrum ($k_\text{eq}$-based $H_0$), but also the overall amplitude (when combined with CMB lensing observations) and the relative amplitudes of the BAO wiggles, thus besides $k_\text{eq}$ other information may also play a role in constraining $H_0$. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty constraining early new physics.</description>

      <title>Perturbing the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating acoustic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

      <title>Extended thermodynamic analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) with mass $m$ and charge $q$ obtained from the Einstein-Horndeski-Maxwell theory. There are two solution branches: one is for the CHB and the other is for the naked singularity (NS). Thermodynamic behavior for the CHB is similar to that for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole but its Helmholtz free energy is always positive. If the NS point is included as an extremal point, then the Helmholtz free energy is always negative, implying that the globally stable region is achieved anywhere. For the NS, its temperature has a maximum point, its heat capacity remains negative without having Davies point, and its free energy decreases without limitation as the charge $q$ increases.</description>

      <title>Signatures of NED on Quasi periodic Oscillations of a Magnetically Charged Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole by analyzing the motion of test particles and their epicyclic frequencies. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the variation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing the RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC results yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass regimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the QPO structure of a charged black hole.</description>
