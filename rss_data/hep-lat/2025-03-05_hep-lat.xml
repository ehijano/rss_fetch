      <title>Momentum Flow and Forces on Quarks in the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Momentum conservation in the nucleon is examined in terms of continuous flow of the momentum density current (or in short, momentum flow), which receives contributions from both kinetic motion and interacting forces involving quarks and gluons. While quarks conduct momentum flow through their kinetic motion and the gluon scalar (anomaly) contributes via pure interactions, the gluon stress tensor has both effects. The quarks momentum flow encodes the information of the force density on them, and the momentum conservation allows to trace its origin to the gluon tensor and anomaly ("negative pressure"). From state-of-the-art lattice calculations and experimental fits on the form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, we exhibit pictures of the momentum flow and forces on the quarks in the nucleon. In particular, the anomaly contributes a critical attractive force with a strength similar to that of a QCD confinement potential.</description>

      <title>Meson dynamics from locally exciting a particle-conserving $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</description>

      <title>Meson spectroscopy in the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory with three antisymmetric fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of an extensive numerical study of the $Sp(4)$ lattice gauge theory with three (Dirac) flavors of fermion in the two-index antisymmetric representation. In the presence of (degenerate) fermion masses, the theory has an enhanced global $SU(6)$ symmetry, broken explicitly and spontaneously to its $SO(6)$ subgroup. This symmetry breaking pattern makes the theory interesting for applications in the context of composite Higgs models, as well as for the implementation of top partial compositeness. It can also provide a dynamical realisation of the strongly interacting massive particle paradigm for the origin of dark matter. We adopt the standard plaquette gauge action with the Wilson-Dirac formulation for the fermions and apply the (rational) hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in our ensemble generation process. We monitor the autocorrelation and topology of the ensembles. We explore the bare parameter space, and identify the weak and strong coupling regimes separated by a line of first-order bulk phase transitions.
  We measure two-point correlation functions between meson operators that transform as non-trivial representations of $SO(6)$, and extract the ground-state masses and the decay constants, in all accessible spin and parity channels. In addition, we measure the mass of the first excited state for the vector meson by solving a generalised eigenvalue problem. Spectral quantities show a mass dependence that is compatible with the expectation that, at long distances, the theory undergoes confinement, accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of the approximate global symmetries acting on the matter fields. Finally, we discuss the continuum and massless extrapolations, after setting the physical scale using the gradient flow method, and compare the results to those of existing studies in the quenched approximation, as well as to the literature on closely related theories.</description>

      <title>$2+1$ dimensional Floquet systems and lattice fermions: Exact bulk spectral equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connection has recently been proposed between periodically driven systems known as Floquet insulators in continuous time and static fermion theories in discrete time. This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional free theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet insulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we investigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet physics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological insulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands with zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous Floquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose bulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra with open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to finite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important respects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the spectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries or on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the static discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has a different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.</description>

      <title>Stringy scaling of multi-tensor hard string scattering amplitudes and the K-identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>
