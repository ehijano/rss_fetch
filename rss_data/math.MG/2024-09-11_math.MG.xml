      <title>The nerd snipers problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We correct errors that appear throughout "The vicious neighbour problem" by Tao and Wu.
  We seek to solve the following problem. Suppose Nnerds are distributed uniformly at random in a square region. At 3:14pm, every nerd simultaneously snipes their nearest neighbor. What is the expected proportion $P_N$ of nerds who are left unscathed in the limit as $N\to\infty$?</description>

      <title>Geometry of the Space of Partitioned Networks: A Unified Theoretical and Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions and relations between objects may be pairwise or higher-order in nature, and so network-valued data are ubiquitous in the real world. The "space of networks", however, has a complex structure that cannot be adequately described using conventional statistical tools. We introduce a measure-theoretic formalism for modeling generalized network structures such as graphs, hypergraphs, or graphs whose nodes come with a partition into categorical classes. We then propose a metric that extends the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between graphs and the co-optimal transport distance between hypergraphs. We characterize the geometry of this space, thereby providing a unified theoretical treatment of generalized networks that encompasses the cases of pairwise, as well as higher-order, relations. In particular, we show that our metric is an Alexandrov space of non-negative curvature, and leverage this structure to define gradients for certain functionals commonly arising in geometric data analysis tasks. We extend our analysis to the setting where vertices have additional label information, and derive efficient computational schemes to use in practice. Equipped with these theoretical and computational tools, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in a suite of applications, including hypergraph alignment, clustering and dictionary learning from ensemble data, multi-omics alignment, as well as multiscale network alignment.</description>

      <title>Spherical and hyperbolic orthogonal ring patterns: integrability and variational principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce orthogonal ring patterns in the 2-sphere and in the hyperbolic plane, consisting of pairs of concentric circles, which generalize circle patterns. We show that their radii are described by a discrete integrable system. This is a special case of the master integrable equation Q4. The variational description is given in terms of elliptic generalizations of the dilogarithm function. They have the same convexity principles as their circle-pattern counterparts. This allows us to prove existence and uniqueness results for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. Some examples are computed numerically. In the limit of small smoothly varying rings, one obtains harmonic maps to the sphere and to the hyperbolic plane. A close relation to discrete surfaces with constant mean curvature is explained.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Lipschitz Homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the Lipschitz analogues of the results Perelman used from Siebenmann's deformation of homeomorphism theory in his proof of the stability theorem. Consequently, we obtain the Lipschitz analogue of Perelman's gluing theorem. Moreover, we obtain the analogous deformation theory but with tracking of the Lipschitz constants.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of Moran sets and their visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate dimensions are a class of new fractal dimensions which provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between the Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions.
  In this paper, we study the intermediate dimensions of Moran sets. Moran sets may be regarded as a generalization of self-similar sets generated by using different class of similar mappings at each level with unfixed translations, and this causes the lack of ergodic properties on Moran set. Therefore, the intermediate dimensions do not necessarily exist, and we calculate the upper and lower intermediate dimensions of Moran sets. In particular, we obtain a simplified intermediate dimension formula for homogeneous Moran sets. Moreover, we study the visualization of the upper intermediate dimensions for some homogeneous Moran sets, and we show that their upper intermediate dimensions are given by Mobius transformations.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequality for non-Euclidean polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical fact in Euclidean geometry that the regular polygon maximizes area amongst polygons of the same perimeter and number of sides, and the analogue of this in non-Euclidean geometries has long been a folklore result. In this note, we present a complete proof of this polygonal isoperimetric inequality in hyperbolic and spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>Fractal percolation on statistically self-affine carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random self-affine carpet $F$ based on an $n\times m$ subdivision of rectangles and a probability $0&lt;p&lt;1$. Starting by dividing $[0,1]^2$ into an $n\times m$ grid of rectangles and selecting these independently with probability $p$, we then divide the selected rectangles into $n\times m$ subrectangles which are again selected with probability $p$; we continue in this way to obtain a statistically self-affine set $F$. We are particularly interested in topological properties of $F$. We show that the critical value of $p$ above which there is a positive probability that $F$ connects the left and right edges of $[0,1]^2$ is the same as the critical value for $F$ to connect the top and bottom edges of $[0,1]^2$. Once this is established we derive various topological properties of $F$ analogous to those known for self-similar carpets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regularization for a Data Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optimization-based approaches to inverse problems and to statistical estimation, it is common to augment criteria that enforce data fidelity with a regularizer that promotes desired structural properties in the solution. The choice of a suitable regularizer is typically driven by a combination of prior domain information and computational considerations. Convex regularizers are attractive computationally but they are limited in the types of structure they can promote. On the other hand, nonconvex regularizers are more flexible in the forms of structure they can promote and they have showcased strong empirical performance in some applications, but they come with the computational challenge of solving the associated optimization problems. In this paper, we seek a systematic understanding of the power and the limitations of convex regularization by investigating the following questions: Given a distribution, what is the optimal regularizer for data drawn from the distribution? What properties of a data source govern whether the optimal regularizer is convex? We address these questions for the class of regularizers specified by functionals that are continuous, positively homogeneous, and positive away from the origin. We say that a regularizer is optimal for a data distribution if the Gibbs density with energy given by the regularizer maximizes the population likelihood (or equivalently, minimizes cross-entropy loss) over all regularizer-induced Gibbs densities. As the regularizers we consider are in one-to-one correspondence with star bodies, we leverage dual Brunn-Minkowski theory to show that a radial function derived from a data distribution is akin to a ``computational sufficient statistic'' as it is the key quantity for identifying optimal regularizers and for assessing the amenability of a data source to convex regularization.</description>
