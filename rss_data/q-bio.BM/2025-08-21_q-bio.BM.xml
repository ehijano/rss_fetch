      <title>Yeast growth is controlled by the proportional scaling of mRNA and ribosome concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growth being fundamental to all aspects of cell biology, we do not yet know its organizing principles in eukaryotic cells. Classic models derived from the bacteria E. coli posit that protein-synthesis rates are set by mass-action collisions between charged tRNAs produced by metabolic enzymes and mRNA-bound ribosomes. These models show that faster growth is achieved by simultaneously raising both ribosome content and peptide elongation speed. Here, we test if these models are valid for eukaryotes by combining single-molecule tracking, spike-in RNA sequencing, and proteomics in 15 carbon- and nitrogen-limited conditions using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Ribosome concentration increases linearly with growth rate, as in bacteria, but the peptide elongation speed remains constant (~9 amino acids/s) and charged tRNAs are not limiting. Total mRNA concentration rises in direct proportion to ribosomes, driven by enhanced RNA polymerase II occupancy of the genome. We show that a simple kinetic model of mRNA-ribosome binding predicts both the fraction of active ribosomes, the growth rate, and responses to transcriptional perturbations. Yeast accelerate growth by coordinately and proportionally co-up-regulating total mRNA and ribosome concentrations, not by speeding elongation. Taken together, our work establishes a new framework for eukaryotic growth control and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Poloidal Orientation in DNA Minicircles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A short (&lt;150 bp) double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule ligated end-to-end forms a DNA minicircle. Due to sequence-dependent, nonuniform bending energetics, such a minicircle is predicted to adopt a certain inside-out orientation, known as the poloidal orientation. Despite theoretical and computational predictions, experimental evidence for this phenomenon has been lacking. In this study, we introduce a single-molecule approach to visualize the poloidal orientation of DNA minicircles. We constructed a set of DNA minicircles, each containing a single biotin located at a different position along one helical turn of the dsDNA, and imaged the location of biotin-bound NeutrAvidin relative to the DNA minicircle using atomic force microscopy (AFM). We applied this approach to two DNA sequences previously predicted to exhibit strongly preferred poloidal orientations. The observed relative positions of NeutrAvidin shifted between the inside and outside of the minicircle with different phases, indicating distinct poloidal orientations for the two sequences. Coarse-grained simulations revealed narrowly distributed poloidal orientations with different mean orientations for each sequence, consistent with the AFM results. Together, our findings provide experimental confirmation of preferred poloidal orientations in DNA minicircles, offering insights into the intrinsic dynamics of circular DNA.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium protein complexes as molecular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biology stores information and computes at the molecular scale, yet the ways in which it does so are often distinct from human-engineered computers. Mapping biological computation onto architectures familiar to computer science remains an outstanding challenge. Here, inspired by Crick's proposal for molecular memory, we analyse a thermodynamically-consistent model of a protein complex subject to driven, nonequilibrium enzymatic reactions. In the strongly driven limit, we find that the system maps onto a stochastic, asynchronous variant of cellular automata, where each rule corresponds to a different set of enzymes being present. We find a broad class of phenomena in these 'molecular automata' that can be exploited for molecular computation, including error-tolerant memory via multistable attractors, and long transients that can be used as molecular stopwatches. By systematically enumerating all possible dynamical rules, we identify those that allow molecular automata to implement simple computational architectures such as finite-state machines. Overall, our results provide a framework for engineering synthetic molecular automata, and offer a route to building protein-based computation in living cells.</description>
