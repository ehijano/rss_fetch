      <title>Integrated effect of the cosmic space magnetic field on the acceleration noise of the TQ gravitational wave detection program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TianQin(TQ) program is to deploy three satellites that can form an equilateral triangle in about 100,000 km Earth orbit to capture gravitational wave signals in the low-frequency band. In order to ensure accurate capture, noise needs to be analyzed and compensated. In this paper, we model and analyze the acceleration noise generated by the test mass affected by the magnetic field in space. In this paper, we use the Tsyganenko model as the background magnetic field of the TQ orbit, calculate the magnetic field and magnetic field gradient of the satellite orbit from 1997 to 2023, analyze the acceleration noise due to the coupling of the residual magnetic moment, the induced magnetic moment with the magnetic field in space and the acceleration noise due to the Lorentz force, and calculate the acceleration integrated noise of the influence of the magnetic field on the test mass from the power spectral densities of the modeled magnetic field and the magnetic field gradient. The acceleration integrated noise of the magnetic field influence on the test mass is calculated from the power spectral density of the magnetic field and the magnetic field gradient obtained by the model. Through the simulation study, the acceleration of the test mass induced by the magnetic field in the space of the TQ orbit reaches the magnitude of $10^{-16}ms^{-1}Hz^{-1/2}$, which is an important source of the influencing noise. The acceleration noise induced by the magnetic field and the Lorentz force is relatively higher than that induced by the magnetic field gradient.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Lateral Impulse Induced Inertial Dilation at the Surface of a Vacuum-Exposed Granular Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate for the first time that a lateral impulse experienced by a granular channel can induce an inertial bulk dilation over long distances across a granular medium with a mechanically free surface. The surface dilation requires zero overburden pressure (exposure to vacuum) and is precipitated by the passing of waves traveling barely above the sound speed (&gt; Mach 1.05). We simulate this phenomenon using open source Soft Sphere Discrete Element Method (SSDEM) software. We prepare channels of monodisperse, cohesive spherical particles exposed to vacuum and modeled as Hertzian springs. We validate our model by recreating acoustic wave, strong shock, and shear dilation behavior. We then create shocks within the channel to determine the sensitivity of surface dilation to wave speed, wave type, initial packing fraction, and boundary effects. The shocks we create undergo a rapid decay in strength and appear to propagate as solitary waves that can be sustained across the channel. We find that an inertial surface dilation is induced by compressive solitary waves, is insensitive to channel length, increases with bed height, and increases substantially with initial packing fraction. A hard subsurface floor is required to maintain this wave over the entire channel. Free surface dilation induced by laterally propagating impulse loading could be implicated in the formation of Lunar Cold Spots, distal regions of low thermal inertia surrounding young craters on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Stellar occultations in support of the LUMIO orbit determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of stellar occultation measurements to enhance the orbit determination performance of the Lunar Meteoroid Impact Observer (LUMIO) mission, operating from a quasi-Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon L2 point. During science phases, when radiometric tracking is sparse and low illumination limits conventional optical navigation methods, occultation events, defined as precise timings of stellar appearances/disappearances behind the Moon's limb, offer a suitable alternative. A simulation tool based on JPL's MONTE library was developed to identify valid occultation events, applying geometric and illumination constraints to exclude non-observable cases. These events were integrated into a batch least-squares orbit determination filter alongside conventional radiometric data. The covariance analysis shows that occultation observables reduce the transverse and normal position uncertainties of LUMIO by up to a factor of two, especially during tracking gaps or occultation-rich arcs. This uncertainty reduction is expected to facilitate station-keeping operations and constrain the surface localization of Lunar Impact Flashes (LIFs), enhancing the mission's scientific return. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the orbit determination performance is primarily driven by the timing accuracy of occultation events, with limited dependence on lunar shape uncertainty below 100 m. These findings confirm the potential of occultation-based navigation to enhance spacecraft autonomy and robustness in low-visibility environments, making it a valuable complement to radiometric techniques for future lunar and deep-space missions.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Effective Viscosity to Quantify Collisional Behavior in Collisionless Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While dissipation in collisional plasma is defined in terms of viscosity and resistivity, the exact functional form of dissipation i.e., the so-called dissipation function in nearly collisionless plasma is unknown. Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that there exists viscous-like energy conversion in collisionless plasma with scaling characteristics analogous to collisional plasma, and in particular that the average dissipation is proportional to the square of the rate of strain as in hydrodynamics. In this study, using 2.5D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of collisionless plasma turbulence, we provide an estimate of effective viscosity at each scale, obtained via a scale-filtering approach. We then compare the turbulent dynamics of the PIC simulation with that from MHD and two-fluid simulations in which with the viscosity is equal to the effective viscosity estimate obtained from the PIC simulation. We find that the global behavior in these MHD and two-fluid simulations has a striking similarity with that in its kinetic/PIC counterpart. In addition, we explore the scale dependence of the effective viscosity, and discuss implications of this approach for space plasmas.</description>

      <title>What determines the brightness of magnetically open solar corona?: Insights from three-dimensional radiative MHD simulations and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between solar coronal holes and open-field regions using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations combined with remote-sensing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our numerical simulations reveal that magnetically open regions in the corona can exhibit brightness comparable to quiet regions, challenging the conventional view that open-field regions are inherently dark coronal holes. We find that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy input from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo, rather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using synthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly used to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at lower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA synoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic field extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source surface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic flux (the ``open flux problem'') arise both from the modeling assumptions in coronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface magnetic field observations. Our findings indicate the need for reconsidering criteria used to identify coronal holes as indicators of open-field regions to better characterize the solar open magnetic flux.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>
