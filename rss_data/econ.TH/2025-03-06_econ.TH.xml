      <title>Function-Coherent Gambles with Non-Additive Sequential Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a rigorous foundation for imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility via its coherence axioms. In our related work, we introduced function-coherent gambles to accommodate non-linear utility. However, when repeated gambles are played over time -- especially in intertemporal choice where rewards compound multiplicatively -- the standard additive combination axiom fails to capture the appropriate long-run evaluation. In this paper we extend the framework by relaxing the additive combination axiom and introducing a nonlinear combination operator that effectively aggregates repeated gambles in the log-domain. This operator preserves the time-average (geometric) growth rate and addresses the ergodicity problem. We prove the key algebraic properties of the operator, discuss its impact on coherence, risk assessment, and representation, and provide a series of illustrative examples. Our approach bridges the gap between expectation values and time averages and unifies normative theory with empirically observed non-stationary reward dynamics.</description>

      <title>Markets for Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the prevalence of prediction problems in the economy, we study markets in which firms sell models to a consumer to help improve their prediction. Firms decide whether to enter, choose models to train on their data, and set prices. The consumer can purchase multiple models and use a weighted average of the models bought. Market outcomes can be expressed in terms of the bias-variance decompositions of the models that firms sell. We show that market structure can depend in subtle and nonmonotonic ways on the statistical properties of available models. Moreover, firms may choose inefficiently biased models to deter entry by competitors or to obtain larger profits.</description>

      <title>Walrasian equilibrium: An alternate proof of existence and lattice structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of two-sided matching market where buyers and sellers trade indivisible goods with the feature that each buyer has unit demand and seller has unit supply. The result of the existence of Walrasian equilibrium and lattice structure of equilibrium price vectors is known. We provide an alternate proof for existence and lattice structure using Tarksi's fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Search Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A platform commits to a search algorithm that maps prices to search order. Given this algorithm, sellers set prices, and consumers engage in sequential search. This framework generalizes the ordered search literature. We introduce a special class of search algorithms, termed ''contracts,'' show that they implement all possible equilibrium prices and then characterize the set of implementable prices. Within this set, we identify the seller-optimal contract, whose first-best outcome remains an open problem for a multiproduct seller. Our findings highlight the conditions under which the platform favors price dispersion or price symmetry. Furthermore, we characterize the consumer-optimal and socially optimal contracts, which exert opposing forces to the seller-optimal contract: while the seller-optimal contract promotes higher prices, the consumer-optimal and socially optimal contracts favor lower prices.</description>

      <title>A Linear Theory of Multi-Winner Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduces a general linear framework that unifies the study of multi-winner voting rules and proportionality axioms, demonstrating that many prominent multi-winner voting rules-including Thiele methods, their sequential variants, and approval-based committee scoring rules-are linear. Similarly, key proportionality axioms such as Justified Representation (JR), Extended JR (EJR), and their strengthened variants (PJR+, EJR+), along with core stability, can fit within this linear structure as well.
  Leveraging PAC learning theory, we establish general and novel upper bounds on the sample complexity of learning linear mappings. Our approach yields near-optimal guarantees for diverse classes of rules, including Thiele methods and ordered weighted average rules, and can be applied to analyze the sample complexity of learning proportionality axioms such as approximate core stability. Furthermore, the linear structure allows us to leverage prior work to extend our analysis beyond worst-case scenarios to study the likelihood of various properties of linear rules and axioms. We introduce a broad class of distributions that extend Impartial Culture for approval preferences, and show that under these distributions, with high probability, any Thiele method is resolute, CORE is non-empty, and any Thiele method satisfies CORE, among other observations on the likelihood of commonly-studied properties in social choice.
  We believe that this linear theory offers a new perspective and powerful new tools for designing and analyzing multi-winner rules in modern social choice applications.</description>
