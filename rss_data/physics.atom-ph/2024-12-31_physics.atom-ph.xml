      <title>Interleaved dual-species arrays of single atoms using a passive optical element and one trapping laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam. This trapping approach is simple and robust compared to common approaches that use active optoelectronic components and multiple laser wavelengths, and can be easily adapted for other atomic species.</description>

      <title>Field-free, Quasi-continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interface with Two-dimensional Ferromagnetic Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a uniform and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$. With the strong field gradient to support atom guiding, the ferromagnetic device may also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons.</description>

      <title>Actively-trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials reproduce mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties of paramagnetic CrN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol for automated fitting of magnetic Moment Tensor Potential explicitly including magnetic moments in its functional form. For the fitting of this potential we use energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) of configurations selected with an active learning algorithm. These selected configurations are computed using constrained density functional theory, which enables calculating energies and their derivatives for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (excited) magnetic states. We test our protocol on the system of B1-CrN and demonstrate that the automatically trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potential reproduces mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties, of B1-CrN in the paramagnetic state with respect to density functional theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.1% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver. Our work contributes to the existing body of literature on QAE by demonstrating that high-quality results can be achieved on noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter-wave spectroscopy of the CH$_3$O radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The methoxy radical, CH$_3$O, has long been studied experimentally and theoretically by spectroscopists because it displays a weak Jahn-Teller effect in its electronic ground state, combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In this work, we report an extension of the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the radical in its vibrational ground state in the submillimeter-wave region (350$-$860 GHz). CH$_3$O was produced by H-abstraction from methanol using F-atoms, and its spectrum was probed in absorption using an association of source-frequency modulation and Zeeman modulation spectroscopy. All the observed transitions together with available literature data in $v = 0$ were combined and fit using an effective Hamiltonian allowing to reproduce the data at their experimental accuracy. The newly measured transitions involve significantly higher frequencies and rotational quantum numbers than those reported in the literature ($f &lt; 860$ GHz and $N \leq 15$ instead of 272 GHz and 7, respectively) which results in significant improvements in the spectroscopic parameters determination. The present model is well constrained and allows a reliable calculation of the rotational spectrum of the radical over the entire microwave to submillimeter-wave domain. It can be used with confidence for future searches of CH$_3$O in the laboratory and the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued 3D atomic spectroscopy with Gaussian-assisted inline holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09117v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a laser-cooled atomic sample is optically excited, the envelope of coherent forward scattering can often be decomposed into a few complex Gaussian profiles. The convenience of Gaussian propagation helps addressing key challenges in digital holography. In this work, we develop a Gaussian-decomposition-assisted approach to inline holography, for single-shot, simultaneous measurements of absorption and phase-shift profiles of small atomic samples sparsely distributed in 3D. The samples' axial positions are resolved with micrometer resolution, and their spectroscopy are extracted from complex-valued images recorded at various probe frequencies. The phase-angle readout is not only robust against transition saturation, but also insensitive to atom-number and optical-pumping-induced interaction-strength fluctuations. Benefiting from such features, we achieve hundred-kHz-level single-shot resolution to the transition frequency of a $^{87}$Rb D2 line, with merely hundreds of atoms. We further demonstrate single-shot 3D field sensing by measuring local light shifts to the atomic array with micrometer spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Internal diffraction dynamics of trilobite molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trilobite molecules are ultralong-range Rydberg molecules formed when a high angular momentum Rydberg electron scatters off of a ground-state atom. Their unique electronic structure and highly oscillatory potential energy curves support a rich variety of dynamical effects yet to be explored. We analyze the vibrational motion of these molecules using a framework of adiabatic wavepacket propagation dynamics and observe that for appropriate initial states, the trilobite potential acts as molecular diffraction grating. The quantum dynamic effects observed are explained using a Fourier analysis of the scattering potential and the associated scattered wavepacket. Furthermore, vibrational ground-states of the low angular momentum ultralong-range Rydberg molecules are found to be particularly suitable to prepare the relevant wavepackets. Hence, we propose a time resolved pump-probe scheme designed for the realization of the effect in question, and advertise the utilization of a single diatomic Rydberg molecule as a testbed for the study of exaggerated quantum dynamical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ultratight confinement of atoms in a Rydberg empowered optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04450v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.</description>
