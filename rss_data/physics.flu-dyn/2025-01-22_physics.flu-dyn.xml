      <title>Jet Size Prediction in Compound Multiphase Bubble Bursting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Worthington jets from bursting bubbles at a gas-liquid interface can break up into small droplets, aerosolizing chemical and biological substances into the atmosphere and impacting both global climate and public health. Despite their importance in contaminant transport, the influence of adsorbed contaminants on bubble-bursting jet dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we document how an immiscible compound contaminant layer impacts the jet radius, which deviates from the expected jetting dynamics produced by clean bubble bursting. We rationalize the deviation of the jet radius by characterizing the propagation of the capillary waves at the air-oil-water interface. We develop a linearized wave damping model based on the understanding of the oil thickness profile and the wave dispersion, and we propose a revised Ohnesorge number with a scaling relation that captures the experimental results reasonably well across a wide range of oil layer thicknesses and viscosities. Our work not only advances the fundamental understanding of bubble bursting jets but also offers valuable insights for predicting aerosol size distributions and modeling the transport of airborne contaminants in realistic environmental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tailwind turbulence: a bound on the energy available from turbulence for transit, tested in Kraichnan's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the unconstrained minimum energy required for vehicles to move through turbulence. We restrict our study to vehicles that interact with their environment through thrust, weight and drag forces, such as rotorcraft or submersibles. For such vehicles, theory predicts an optimum ratio between vehicle velocity and a characteristic velocity of the turbulence. The energy required for transit can be substantially smaller than what is required to move through quiescent fluid. We describe a simple picture for how a flight trajectory could preferentially put vehicles in tailwinds rather than headwinds, predicated on the organization of turbulence around vortices. This leads to an analytical parameter-free lower bound on the energy required to traverse a turbulent flow. We test this bound by computationally optimizing trajectories in Kraichnan's model of turbulence, and find that the energy required by point-models of vehicles is slightly larger than but close to our bound. Finally, we predict the existence of an optimum level of turbulence for which power is minimized, so that turbulence can be both too strong or too weak to be useful. This work strengthens previous findings that environmental turbulence can always reduce energy use. Thus, favorable trajectories are available to maneuverable vehicles if they have sufficient knowledge of the flow and computational resources for path planning.</description>

      <title>Classical waves and instabilities using the minimalist approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimalist approach in the study of perturbations in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics involves describing their evolution in the linear regime using a single first-order ordinary differential equation, dubbed principal equation. The dispersion relation is determined by requiring that the solution of the principal equation be continuous and satisfy specific boundary conditions for each problem. The formalism is presented for flows in cartesian geometry and applied to classical cases such as the magnetosonic and gravity waves, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. For the latter, we discuss the influence of compressibility and the magnetic field, and also derive analytical expressions for the growth rates and the range of instability in the case of two fluids with the same characteristics.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Field on Aqueous Humor Flows Inside Anterior Chamber of Human Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous humor (AH) dynamics is responsible for maintaining intraocular pressure, ocular health and targeted drug delivery within the eye. This study investigates the flow of AH within the anterior chamber (AC) under the combined influence of a uniform magnetic field and natural convection. Different orientations of the magnetic field and temperaature gradient are considered. A lubrication approximation is employed and the resulting equations are solved using regular perturbation method. The analytical solutions are validated using numerical simulations performed in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2. In the standing position, AH flow field is characterised by a single vortex, while in the supine position, it forms two counter-rotating vortices. The velocity is found to be higher in standing position. The effect of a uniform magnetic field on the velocity is more significant in the supine position. The magnetic field does not change the flow field qualitatively as buoyancy is the primary driving force. In the standing position a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the eye resulted in a greatest reduction of AH velocity, as compared to a magnetic field along the eye. This study is a step towards holistic approach for targeted drug delivery using magnetic fields in eye.</description>

      <title>Incremental Model Order Reduction of Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering simulations are usually based on complex, grid-based, or mesh-free methods for solving partial differential equations. The results of these methods cover large fields of physical quantities at very many discrete spatial locations and temporal points. Efficient compression methods can be helpful for processing and reusing such large amounts of data. A compression technique is attractive if it causes only a small additional effort and the loss of information with strong compression is low. The paper presents the development of an incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) strategy for compressing time-dependent particle simulation results. The approach is based on an algorithm that was previously developed for grid-based, regular snapshot data matrices. It is further developed here to process highly irregular data matrices generated by particle simulation methods during simulation. Various aspects important for information loss, computational effort and storage requirements are discussed, and corresponding solution techniques are investigated. These include the development of an adaptive rank truncation approach, the assessment of imputation strategies to close snapshot matrix gaps caused by temporarily inactive particles, a suggestion for sequencing the data history into temporal windows as well as bundling the SVD updates. The simulation-accompanying method is embedded in a parallel, industrialized Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics software and applied to several 2D and 3D test cases. The proposed approach reduces the memory requirement by about 90% and increases the computational effort by about 10%, while preserving the required accuracy. For the final application of a water turbine, the temporal evolution of the force and torque values for the compressed and simulated data is in excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Spectral dynamics of natural and forced supersonic twin-rectangular jet flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary, intermittent, and nonlinear dynamics of natural and forced supersonic twin-rectangular turbulent jets using spectral modal decomposition. We decompose large-eddy simulation data into four reflectional symmetry components about the major and minor axes. In the natural jet, spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) uncovers two resonant instabilities antisymmetric about the major axis. Known as screech tones, the more energetic of the two is symmetric about the minor axis and steady, while the other is intermittent. We test the hypothesis that flow symmetry can be leveraged for control design. Time-periodic forcing symmetric about the major and minor axes is implemented using a plasma actuation model, and succeeds in removing screech from a different symmetry component. We investigate the spectral peaks of the forced jet using an extension of bispectral mode decomposition (BMD), where the bispectrum is bounded by unity and which conditionally recovers the SPOD. We explain the appearance of harmonic peaks as three sets of triadic interactions between reflectional symmetries, forming an interconnected triad network. BMD modes of active triads distil coherent structures comprising multiple coupled instabilities, including Kelvin-Helmholtz, core, and guided-jet modes (G-JM). Downstream-propagating core modes can be symmetric or antisymmetric about the major axis, whereas upstream-propagating G-JM responsible for screech closure (Edgington-Mitchell et al., 2022, JFM) are antisymmetric only. The dependence of G-JM on symmetry hence translates from the azimuthal symmetry of the round jet to the dihedral group symmetry of the twin-rectangular jet, and explains why the twin jet exhibits antisymmetric but not symmetric screech modes.</description>

      <title>Digital Sub-millimeter Bubble-Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create digital sub-millimeter bubble-jet emitting in gas-liquid co-flows at tapered chip zone for moderate $Re \sim [20, 120]$. Self-similarity features are revealed at the tapered area and giving birth to a local model. Local self-scaling characteristic quantities, $W_{\text{local}}$ and $L_{\text{cone}}$, are introduced to scale energies and progresses at onsets of bubble-jets, which gives highly universal phase diagram and also scaling law of jet velocity. The phase diagram draws critical bubble-jetting line at $We_d\sim Ca_c^{-5.7}$ and jet-dropping line at $We_d\sim Ca_c^{-4.2}$, as well as orthogonally overlaping Taylor bubble area from annular flow pattern. And the jetting velocity expresses as $u_{\text{jet}}\sim [\rho_c^2\sigma (Q_c + Q_d)^2]/(\mu_c^3 W_{\text{local}}^{1.6}H^{0.4})$, which clarifies the compound mechanisms for bubble-jet emitting by combined competing of interfacial tension, inertia, viscosity, and the local tapered geometries. These universalities confirm reciprocally similarities of the bubble-jet emitting processes on behaviors and flow structures at the local tapered zone.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Pushing of a Spherical Cargo using an Active Spherical Janus Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the interaction between a self-diffusiophoretic spherical Janus motor and an inert spherical cargo particle in an axisymmetric configuration in the Stokes regime. To study the different configurations of the two spheres and their motions, we develop an analog to the twin multipole approach to numerically determine the axisymmetric stream function for the flow field. We verify the validity and accuracy of this approach using existing literature and COMSOL Multiphysics. We study the effects of the size of the Janus cap, the relative ratio of sizes of the two spheres, and their separation distance on their interactions. For the case of a stationary cargo, we identify the existence of a distinct regime where the Janus motor hovers at a finite separation distance from the cargo and summarize the results using a phase diagram. In the presence of a freely moving cargo, we analyze the steady terminal velocities of the Janus motor and the cargo to identify distinct conditions at which the two spheres can translate with equal velocities while maintaining a finite separation distance.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced plasma formation and cavitation in water: from nanoeffects to extreme states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the energy dependence of optical breakdown in water by tightly focused laser pulses, from plasma formation to shock waves and cavitation. Laser pulses of fs to ns durations and UV to IR wavelengths are aberration-free focused through microscope objectives. Photography captures luminescent plasmas with submicrometer resolution, and bubble threshold and size are determined via probe beam scattering. The energy dependence of mechanical effects is quantified through the maximum bubble radius Rmax. We find three key scenarios depicting the interaction between multiphoton and avalanche ionization, recombination, and thermal ionization from nanoeffects near threshold to extreme energy densities. They include a previously unknown scenario that emerges with single-longitudinal-mode UV ns pulses from compact lasers. It enables cost-effective creation of nanoeffects, as demonstrated on corneal tissue and glass. Plasma photography reveals new insights in the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasma formation, with an interplay of breakdown waves, string formation by local instabilities of avalanche ionization, and radiative energy transport. Plasma volume data from photographs together with absorption measurements show that the average energy density of luminescent fs and ns plasmas is similar, ranging between 10 and 40 kJ/cm^3. However, small hot regions with up to 400 kJ/cm^3 are formed in ns breakdown. From the hot regions, energy is spread out via X-ray bremsstrahlung, forming a luminescent halo. Well above threshold, Rmax scales with EL^1/3 across all scenarios, with 15% - 20% conversion of laser energy into bubble energy. With increasing plasma energy density, an ever-larger energy fraction is converted into shock wave energy (75% at 40 kJ/cm^3). The results provide guidelines for parameter selection in laser surgery and material processing.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving the Two-Dimensional Shallow Water Equations with Terrain Topography and Rainfall Source Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the two-dimensional shallow water equations is a fundamental problem in flood simulation technology. In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a novel methodology for addressing this problem. Given their advantages in parallel computing, the potential for data assimilation and parameter calibration, and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, it is crucial to investigate both the capabilities and limitations of PINNs. While current research has demonstrated the significant potential of PINNs, many aspects of this new approach remain to be explored. In this study, we employ PINNs enhanced by dimensional transformation and N-LAAF techniques to validate their effectiveness in solving two-dimensional free surface flow with rainfall on terrain topography. The shallow water equations primarily exist in two forms: the variables form and the conservative form. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that a hybrid variable-conservation form offers superior performance. Additionally, we find that incorporating the energy conservation law, specifically the entropy condition, does not yield substantial improvements and may even lead to training failure. Furthermore, we have developed an open-source module on the PINNacle platform for solving shallow water equations using PINNs, which includes over ten case studies and various equation forms, to promote research and application in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the hydrodynamics of a rotating disk in a two-dimensional compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity. Unlike conventional fluids, odd viscosity introduces a radial flow component that can be directed either inward or outward, depending on its sign. This phenomenon is expected to significantly impact the hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating disks, potentially causing effective attraction or repulsion depending on the sign of the odd viscosity and the direction of rotation. Furthermore, we calculate the rotational resistance coefficient and find that odd viscosity increases this coefficient, regardless of its sign.</description>

      <title>Competition between thermocapillary and solutocapillary flows in thin liquid films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermocapillary flow in a thin liquid film which is subjected to local heating, in the presence of insoluble surfactants. While surfactant molecules are first advected from warmer to cooler regions, the resulting concentration gradient drives a solutal counterflow in the opposite direction. This competition is theoretically addressed within the lubrication approximation. Assuming small deviations with respect to the mean surfactant concentration, we derive the time evolution equation governing the shape of the interface. Our study reveals that both interfacial deformations and velocities are progressively suppressed as the solutal Marangoni number increases. Our versatile model, adaptable to a range of experimental setups, offers a quantitative tool for understanding the effect of surfactants in thermocapillary-driven systems.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Analysis of Two-phase Flows Simulated with the Diffuse Interface Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Phase-Field Method (PFM) is employed to simulate two-phase flows, with the fully-coupled Cahn- Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations governing the temporal evolution of the flow. The methodology is fundamentally based on the minimization of the total energy functional, accounting for diffusive and viscous dissipations in the presence of fluid flow. A novel perspective is presented by analyzing the interplay between kinetic energy, mixing energy, and viscous dissipation using the temporal evolution of the total energy functional. The classical surface energy is approximated with mixing energy under specific conditions, and the accuracy of this substitution is rigorously evaluated. The energy-based surface tension formulation, derived from the Korteweg stress tensor, demonstrates exceptional accuracy in capturing variations in mixing energy. These concepts are demonstrated by considering two benchmark problems: droplet oscillation and capillary jet breakup. Key findings include the identification of scenarios where curvature non-uniformity increases errors in surface energy approximation and the discovery of distinct energy dissipation patterns during jet breakup and droplet oscillations. The results highlight the robustness of the free energy-based PFM in accurately capturing complex interfacial dynamics, while providing practical strategies to ensure numerical consistency.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced proliferation of vortices around marine invertebrate larvae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic three-dimensional flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip, to study their flows in quasi-two-dimensions. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number flows at the larval scale in quasi-2D confinement - particularly in light of their complex forms - has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement, and elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, multiple vortices appeared. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced larval flows, which suggests that the vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than the larval forms. Our work provides fundamental insights into the form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding fluid flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak dynamo regimes in Taylor-Couette flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. Both the amplitude of initial perturbations and $Pm$ play a critical role in its onset and evolution. It is shown that this dynamo exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, more turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in many astrophysical settings with small $Pm$.</description>

      <title>Large Amplitude Oscillatory Extension (LAOE) of dilute polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an experimental framework for large amplitude oscillatory extension (LAOE) to investigate nonlinear material properties of complex fluids. Using a microfluidic optimized shape cross-slot extensional rheometer, we generate approximately homogeneous planar extensional flows driven by programmable syringe pumps operating in oscillatory or pulsatile sinusoidal modes. Micro-particle image velocimetry and simultaneous pressure drop measurements are employed to analyze the time-dependent flow field and elastic stress response. For Newtonian fluids, a linear relationship between the applied strain rate and pressure drop is observed across a wide range of oscillation amplitudes and frequencies. In contrast, dilute polymer solutions exhibit significant deviations, with excess pressure drops and divergence between average strain rates along extension and compression axes during the LAOE cycle. By spanning a broad range of Weissenberg and Deborah numbers, we identify unique Lissajous curves and critical conditions for the onset of nonlinearities under oscillatory extension. Numerical simulations, assuming homogeneous flow, underpin the experimental findings, validating the robustness of our microfluidic approach. This study demonstrates the utility of oscillatory extensional flows for probing the nonlinear rheological behavior of soft materials, offering quantitative insights into their extensional properties under nonlinear flow conditions.</description>

      <title>FENN: Feature-enhanced neural network for solving partial differential equations involving fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown remarkable prospects in solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs still face the challenge of high computational cost in solving strongly nonlinear PDEs involving fluid dynamics. In this study, inspired by the input design in surrogate modeling, we propose a feature-enhanced neural network. By introducing geometric features including distance and angle or physical features including the solution of the potential flow equation in the inputs of PINNs, FENN can more easily learn the flow, resulting in better performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. We establish the feature networks in advance to avoid the invalid PDE loss in FENN caused by neglecting the partial derivatives of the features with respect to space-time coordinates. Through five numerical experiments involving forward, inverse, and parametric problems, we verify that FENN generally reduces the computational cost of PINNs by approximately four times. In addition, the numerical experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the number of observed data for inverse problem and successfully solve the parametric problem where PINNs fail.</description>

      <title>Unified Flow Rule of Undeveloped and Fully Developed Dense Granular Flows Down Rough Inclines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on chute measurements of the free-surface velocity $v$ in dense flows of spheres and diverse sands and spheres-sand mixtures down rough inclines. These and previous measurements are inconsistent with standard flow rules, in which the Froude number $v/\sqrt{gh}$ scales linearly with $h/h_s$ or $(\tan\theta/\mu_r)^2h/h_s$, where $\mu_r$ is the dynamic friction coefficient, $h$ the flow thickness, and $h_s(\theta)$ its smallest value that permits a steady, uniform dense flow state at a given inclination angle $\theta$. This is because the characteristic length $L$ a flow needs to fully develop can exceed the chute or travel length $l$ and because neither rule is universal for fully developed flows across granular materials. We use a dimensional analysis motivated by a recent unification of sediment transport to derive a flow rule that solves both problems in accordance with our and previous measurements: $v=v_\infty[1-\exp(-l/L)]^{1/2}$, with $v_\infty\propto\mu_r^{3/2}\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{4/3}$ and $L\propto\mu_r^3\left[(\tan\theta-\mu_r)h\right]^{5/3}h$.</description>

      <title>Coevolving aerodynamic and impact ripples on Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Windblown sand creates multiscale bedforms on Earth, Mars, and other planetary bodies. According to conventional wisdom, decameter-scale dunes and decimeter-scale ripples emerge via distinct mechanisms on Earth: a hydrodynamic instability related to a phase shift between the turbulent flow and the topography, and a granular instability related to a synchronization of hopping grains with the topography. Here, we report the reproducible creation of coevolving centimeter and decimeter-scale ripples on fine-grained monodisperse sand beds in ambient-air and low-pressure wind-tunnels, revealing two adjacent mesoscale growth instabilities. Their morphological traits and our quantitative grain-scale numerical simulations authenticate the smaller structures as impact ripples but point at a hydrodynamic origin for the larger ones. This suggests that the aeolian transport layer would have to partially respond to the topography on a scale comparable to the average hop length, hence faster than previously thought, but consistent with the phase lag of the inferred aeolian sand flux relative to the wind. Hydrodynamic modelling supports the existence of hydrodynamic aerodynamic ripples on Earth, connecting them mechanistically to megaripples and to the debated Martian ripples. We thereby propose a unified framework for mesoscale granular bedforms found across the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale defects and heterogeneous cavitation in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavitation, the formation of vapor bubbles in metastable liquids, is highly sensitive to nanoscale surface defects. Using molecular dynamics simulations and classical nucleation theory, we show that pure water confined within defect-free walls can withstand extreme negative pressures, far beyond those observed experimentally. Hydrophobic surfaces trigger heterogeneous cavitation and lower the cavitation pressure magnitude, but not to experimental levels. Notably, a single nanoscopic surface defect capable of hosting a vapor bubble drastically reduces the tensile strength of water. We find that defects as small as 1-2 nm can act as effective cavitation nuclei, a scale smaller than predicted by simple mechanical stability arguments. This discrepancy arises from stochastic fluctuations of the vapor bubble, which can overcome the kinetic free-energy barrier for cavitation. Our findings show that cavitation is predominantly determined by the largest surface defect rather than the overall defect density, emphasizing the importance of eliminating the largest surface imperfections to enhance stability against cavitation.</description>

      <title>Experimental models for cohesive granular materials: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular materials are involved in most industrial and environmental processes, as well as many civil engineering applications. Although significant advances have been made in understanding the statics and dynamics of cohesionless grains over the past decades, most granular systems we encounter often display some adhesive forces between grains. The presence of cohesion has effects at distances substantially larger than the closest neighbors and consequently can greatly modify their overall behavior. While considerable progress has been made in understanding and describing cohesive granular systems through idealized numerical simulations, controlled experiments corroborating and expanding the wide range of behavior remain challenging to perform. In recent years, various experimental approaches have been developed to control inter-particle adhesion that now pave the way to further our understanding of cohesive granular flows. This article reviews different approaches for making particles sticky, controlling their relative stickiness, and thereby studying their granular and bulk mechanics. Some recent experimental studies relying on model cohesive grains are synthesized, and opportunities and perspectives in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear analysis of gravitational instability in a 3D gaseous disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical discs which are sufficiently massive and cool are linearly unstable to the formation of axisymmetric structures. In practice, linearly stable discs of surface density slightly below the threshold needed for this instability often form spiral structures, and can subsequently fragment or exhibit a state of self-sustained turbulence, depending on how rapidly the disc cools. This has raised the question of how such turbulence is possible in the linearly stable regime. We suggest a nonlinear mechanism for this phenomenon. We find analytically weakly nonlinear axisymmetric subcritical solitary equilibria which exist in linearly stable 3D discs that are close to the instability threshold. The energy of these 'soliton' solutions is only slightly higher than that of a uniform disc, and the structures themselves are expected to be unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. In this way, these subcritical solitary equilibria highlight a nonlinear instability and provide a possible pathway to a turbulent state in linearly stable discs.</description>

      <title>How a leak can stop itself</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small fluid leaks are common and frequently troublesome. We often consider how to stop a leak, but here we ask a different question: how might a leak stop itself? We experimentally study leaking flow transitions from continuous drainage to spontaneous arrest. High-speed imaging reveals that fluid breakup events generate droplets whose Laplace pressures oppose the leak. Early droplets grow unstably, allowing the leak to continue, but ultimately a final capping droplet equilibrates to a stable spherical cap via lightly damped harmonic oscillations. A total energetic theory incorporating both the potential and kinetic energy of attempted capping droplets shows that inertia plays a key role in the leak-stop mechanism. Further experiments examining the stability of rivulet flow in such a system demonstrate that a transition from continuous to discrete flow is an essential prerequisite in determining when a leak can stop itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wetting and dewetting dynamics of simple and complex liquids is described by kinetic equations in gradient dynamics form that incorporates the various coupled dissipative processes in a fully thermodynamically consistent manner. After briefly reviewing this, we also review how chemical reactions can be captured by a related gradient dynamics description, assuming detailed balanced mass action type kinetics. Then, we bring both aspects together and discuss mesoscopic reactive thin-film hydrodynamics illustrated by two examples, namely, models for reactive wetting and reactive surfactants. These models can describe the approach to equilibrium but may also be employed to study out-of-equilibrium chemo-mechanical dynamics. In the latter case, one breaks the gradient dynamics form by chemostatting to obtain active systems. In this way, for reactive wetting we recover running drops that are driven by chemically sustained wettability gradients and for drops covered by autocatalytic reactive surfactants we find complex forms of self-propulsion and self-excited oscillations.</description>

      <title>Predicting Energy Budgets in Droplet Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.</description>

      <title>A Computational Study of Bubble Formation from an Orifice Submerged in Liquid with Constant Gas Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bubble formation process from an orifice submerged in liquid with constant gas flow is studied by numerical simulations using an OpenFOAM volume-of-fluid solver. The computed results show that the detached bubble size tends to increase with the gas flow rate, orifice size, surface tension, liquid contact angle, etc. in qualitative agreement with most previous authors. For a given orifice size and liquid properties, there exists a critical gas flow rate above which detached bubbles will combine via coalescence known as bubble pairing. At low gas flow rates, the volume of detached bubbles in the quasi-static regime is shown to depend linearly on the gas flow rate, consistent with a physical mechanistic analysis but not recognized by previous authors. The detached bubble size seems insensitive to the contact angle when the liquid adequately wets the orifice wall but can increase substantially if the contact angle is increased beyond a critical value resulting in contact line motion on the horizontal outside wall of the orifice. The value of such a critical contact angle is found to increase with the orifice size and to decrease with the gas flow rate. Such revelations would logically suggest that reducing orifice size to generate smaller bubbles could be more challenging and practically difficult for sub-millimeter orifices with a constant gas flow.</description>

      <title>Learning rheological parameters of non-Newtonian fluids from velocimetry data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct the flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters. By incorporating a Carreau shear-thinning viscosity model into the N-S problem, we devise an algorithm that learns the most likely Carreau parameters of a shear-thinning fluid, and estimates their uncertainties, from velocimetry data alone. We then conduct a flow-MRI experiment to obtain velocimetry data of an axisymmetric laminar jet through an idealised medical device (FDA nozzle) for a blood analogue fluid. We show that the algorithm can successfully reconstruct the flow field by learning the most likely Carreau parameters, and that the learned parameters are in very good agreement with rheometry measurements. The algorithm accepts any algebraic effective viscosity model, as long as the model is differentiable, and it can be extended to more complicated non-Newtonian fluids (e.g. Oldroyd-B fluid) if a viscoelastic model is incorporated into the N-S problem.</description>

      <title>A new complex fluid flow phenomenon: Bubbles-on-a-String</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A liquid jet plunging into a quiescent bath of the same liquid is a fundamental fluid mechanical problem underpinning a range of processes in industry and the natural world. Significant attention has been given to the study of plunging laminar Newtonian jets and the associated air entrainment that can occur. However, there have been very few (if any) studies devoted to the equivalent case for non-Newtonian viscoelastic liquids. Here we consider the laminar plunging and associated air entrainment of a shear thinning viscoelastic jet into a still bath of the same liquid. We describe a previously unreported phenomenon, that we call ``bubbles-on-a-string'' (BUoaS), consisting of multiple stable toroidal bubbles rising co-axially around the submerged jet. In a qualitative sense, this new observation is akin to an inverse version of the well-known rheological phenomenon ``beads-on-a-string''. The BUoaS phenomenon is stable and repeatable and can be reproduced to a lesser extent in Newtonian surfactant solutions, indicating that low surface tension is key, but non-Newtonian rheology seems likely to provide the most favourable conditions for the onset of the phenomenon. A full characterisation and detailed study of this behaviour with accompanying numerical simulation is to follow in an upcoming publication.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the One-Way Navier Stokes (OWNS) approach to support nonlinear interactions between waves of different frequencies, which will enable nonlinear analysis of instability and transition. In OWNS, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations are parabolized and solved in the frequency domain as a spatial initial-value (marching) problem. OWNS yields a reduced computational cost compared to global solvers, while also conferring numerous advantages over the parabolized stability equations (PSE), despite its higher computational cost relative to PSE, that we seek to extend to nonlinear analysis. We validate the nonlinear OWNS (NOWNS) method by examining nonlinear evolution of two- and three-dimensional disturbances in a low-speed Blasius boundary layer compared to nonlinear PSE (NPSE) and direct numerical simulation (DNS) results from the literature. We demonstrate that NOWNS can be used to simulate flows involve blowing/suction strips, is more robust to numerical noise, and converges for stronger nonlinearities, as compared to NPSE.</description>

      <title>Computational Investigation of Roughness Effects on Boundary Layer Transition for Stetson's Blunt Cone at Mach 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this aerothermal study, we performed a two-dimensional steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and heat conduction simulation at Mach 6. The key to our methodology was a one-way coupling between CFD surface temperature as a boundary condition and the calculation of the heat transfer flux and temperatures inside the solid stainless-steel body of a nose geometry. This approach allowed us to gain insight into surface heat transfer signatures with corresponding fluid flow regimes, such as the one experienced in laminar fluid flow. We have also examined this heat transfer under roughness values encountered in Stetson's studies at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ludwig tube. To validate our findings, we have performed this type of work on a blunt cone, specifically for the U.S. Air Force. The research focuses on predicting transition onset using laminar correlations derived from Stetson's experimental studies, examining the role of discrete roughness elements. Findings emphasize the importance of incorporating non-equilibrium effects in future computational frameworks to enhance predictive accuracy for high-speed aerodynamic applications.</description>

      <title>Elastoinertial turbulence: Data-driven reduced-order model based on manifold dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a chaotic state that emerges in the flows of dilute polymer solutions. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of EIT is highly computationally expensive due to the need to resolve the multi-scale nature of the system. While DNS of 2D EIT typically requires $O(10^6)$ degrees of freedom, we demonstrate here that a data-driven modeling framework allows for the construction of an accurate model with 50 degrees of freedom. We achieve a low-dimensional representation of the full state by first applying a viscoelastic variant of proper orthogonal decomposition to DNS results, and then using an autoencoder. The dynamics of this low-dimensional representation are learned using the neural ODE method, which approximates the vector field for the reduced dynamics as a neural network. The resulting low-dimensional data-driven model effectively captures short-time dynamics over the span of one correlation time, as well as long-time dynamics, particularly the self-similar, nested traveling wave structure of 2D EIT in the parameter range considered.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics-Like Formalism for Immiscible and Incompressible Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is possible to formulate immiscible and incompressible two-phase flow in porous media in a mathematical framework resembling thermodynamics based on the Jaynes generalization of statistical mechanics. We review this approach and discuss the meaning of the emergent variables that appear, agiture, flow derivative and flow pressure, which are conjugate to the configurational entropy, the saturation and the porosity respectively. We conjecture that the agiture, the temperature-like variable, is directly related to the pressure gradient. This has as a consequence that the configurational entropy, a measure of how the fluids are distributed within the porous media and the accompanying velocity field, and the differential mobility of the fluids are related. We also develop elements of another version of the thermodynamics-like formalism where fractional flow rather than saturation is the control variable, since this is typically the natural control variable in experiments.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamically Beneficial School Configurations in Carangiform Swimmers: Insights from a Flow-Physics Informed Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers have long debated which spatial arrangements and swimming synchronizations are beneficial for the hydrodynamic performance of fish in schools. In our previous work (Seo and Mittal, Bioinsp. Biomim., Vol. 17, 066020, 2022), we demonstrated using direct numerical simulations that hydrodynamic interactions with the wake of a leading body-caudal fin carangiform swimmer could significantly enhance the swimming performance of a trailing swimmer by augmenting the leading-edge vortex (LEV) on its caudal fin. In this study, we develop a model based on the phenomenology of LEV enhancement, which utilizes wake velocity data from direct numerical simulations of a leading fish to predict the trailing swimmer's hydrodynamic performance without additional simulations. This approach enables a comprehensive analysis of the effects of relative positioning, phase difference, flapping amplitude, Reynolds number, and the number of swimmers in the school on thrust enhancement. The results offer several insights regarding the effect of these parameters that have implications for fish schools as well as for bio-inspired underwater vehicle applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of tidal flows through the Strait of Gibraltar using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Strait of Gibraltar is a region characterized by intricate oceanic sub-mesoscale features, influenced by topography, tidal forces, instabilities, and nonlinear hydraulic processes, all governed by the nonlinear equations of fluid motion. In this study, we aim to uncover the underlying physics of these phenomena within 3D MIT general circulation model simulations, including waves, eddies, and gyres. To achieve this, we employ Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to break down simulation snapshots into Koopman modes, with distinct exponential growth/decay rates and oscillation frequencies. Our objectives encompass evaluating DMD's efficacy in capturing known features, unveiling new elements, ranking modes, and exploring order reduction. We also introduce modifications to enhance DMD's robustness, numerical accuracy, and robustness of eigenvalues. DMD analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of flow patterns, internal wave formation, and the dynamics of the Strait of Gibraltar, its meandering behaviors, and the formation of a secondary gyre, notably the Western Alboran Gyre, as well as the propagation of Kelvin and coastal-trapped waves along the African coast. In doing so, it significantly advances our comprehension of intricate oceanographic phenomena and underscores the immense utility of DMD as an analytical tool for such complex datasets, suggesting that DMD could serve as a valuable addition to the toolkit of oceanographers.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Approximating the Statistics of a Chaotic Lorenz System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximating the statistical properties of turbulent flows by combining variational methods for the search of unstable periodic orbits with resolvent analysis for dimensionality reduction. Traditional approaches relying on identifying all short, fundamental unstable periodic orbits to compute ergodic averages via cycle expansion are computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional fluid systems. Our framework stems from the observation in Lasagna, Phys. Rev. E (2020), that a single unstable periodic orbit with a period sufficiently long to span a large fraction of the attractor captures the statistical properties of chaotic trajectories. Given the difficulty of identifying unstable periodic orbits for high-dimensional fluid systems, approximate trajectories residing in a low-dimensional subspace are instead constructed using resolvent modes, which inherently capture the temporal periodicity of unstable periodic orbits. The amplitude coefficients of these modes are adjusted iteratively with gradient-based optimisation to minimise the violation of the projected governing equations, producing trajectories that approximate, rather than exactly solve, the system dynamics. A first attempt at utilising this framework on a chaotic system is made here on the Lorenz 1963 equations, where resolvent analysis enables an exact dimensionality reduction from three to two dimensions. Key observables averaged over these trajectories produced by the approach as well as probability distributions and spectra rapidly converge to values obtained from long chaotic simulations, even with a limited number of iterations. This indicates that exact solutions may not be necessary to approximate the system's statistical behaviour, as the trajectories obtained from partial optimisation provide a sufficient ``sketch'' of the attractor in state space.</description>
