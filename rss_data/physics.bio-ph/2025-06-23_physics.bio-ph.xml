      <title>Neutron Reflectometry Reveals Conformational Changes in a Mechanosensitive Protein Induced by an Antimicrobial Peptide in Tethered Lipid Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane proteins serve a wide range of vital roles in the functioning of living organisms. Compared to other classes of proteins, determining membrane protein structures remains a challenge, in large part due to the difficulty in establishing experimental conditions that can preserve the correct conformation and function of the protein in isolation from its native environment. We investigated the ion channel in lipid vesicles and in a planar lipid bilayer. By using a polymeric tether our planar membrane mimetic was not constrained by the underlying solid substrate, making it sufficiently flexible to allow for increases in bilayer curvature and changes in membrane tension. We used quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), and polarised neutron reflectivity (PNR) to show the formation of MscL containing phospholipid bilayers, tethered with a high density PEG layer onto gold substrates from vesicle rupture. The MscL containing vesicles were separately characterised with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). MscL was expressed into vesicles using cell free protein expression. Analysing these vesicles with small angle neutron scattering, the radius of gyration of the protein was determined to be between 26-29~\AA{}, consistent with the crystal structure of individual MscL channels. The MscL composition of the formed bilayer was 14\%$v/v$, close to the initial composition of the vesicles, and a protein protrusion extending ca. 46~\AA{} into the solvent was determined by PNR. Addition of 1.6 and 3.2 $\mu$M pexiganan resulted in a decrease in the protrusion of MscL (from $\sim$46 to $\sim$38~\AA{}). To our knowledge, these findings represent the first direct experimental evidence of a structural change in the C-terminus containing protrusion of MscL, triggered by an antimicrobial peptide.</description>

      <title>Learning to flock in open space by avoiding collisions and staying together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cohesive flocking in open, boundless space using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Agents integrate positional and orientational information from their closest topological neighbours and learn to balance alignment and attractive interactions by optimizing a local cost function that penalizes both excessive separation and close-range crowding. The resulting Vicsek-like dynamics is robust to algorithmic implementation details and yields cohesive collective motion with high polar order. The optimal policy is dominated by strong aligning interactions when agents are sufficiently close to their neighbours, and a flexible combination of alignment and attraction at larger separations. We further characterize the internal structure and dynamics of the resulting groups using liquid-state metrics and neighbour exchange rates, finding qualitative agreement with empirical observations in starling flocks. These results suggest that flocking may emerge in groups of moving agents as an adaptive response to the biological imperatives of staying together while avoiding collisions.</description>

      <title>Development and in vitro Characterization of a Novel Bioactive Hydrogel for Bioprinting Uterine Constructs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and Aim: Decellularized uterine extracellular matrix (dUECM) offers a promising bioactive scaffold for uterine tissue engineering, but its application in 3D constructs has been limited by fabrication challenges. This study aimed to develop a printable, bioactive hydrogel from dUECM suitable for 3D bioprinting and to evaluate its ability to support human uterine myometrial cell growth in vitro.
  Materials and Methods: Porcine uterine tissues were decellularized using 1 percent Triton X-100 and 0.1 to 1.5 percent SDS for 48 to 72 hours. The resulting dUECM was assessed via histology, DNA and GAG quantification, scanning electron microscopy, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Selected dUECM samples were digested with pepsin and blended with 2 or 3 percent alginate to create bioinks. Constructs were printed using extrusion-based bioprinting and evaluated for swelling, degradation, mechanical properties, and printability. Biocompatibility was tested by seeding hTERT-HM cells onto cast hydrogels and performing MTT and Live/Dead assays over seven days.
  Results: The optimal protocol (1 percent Triton X-100 and 1 percent SDS for 48 hours) reduced DNA to 51.3 ng per mg, while retaining 54.9 micrograms per mg of GAGs. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy confirmed collagen preservation, while thermal stability was moderately reduced. The 3 percent alginate with 1.5 percent dUECM formulation showed superior printability, swelling stability, degradation resistance, and mechanical strength. Cell proliferation reached 258 percent by day 7, significantly outperforming alginate alone.
  Conclusion: The optimized dUECM hydrogel supports printability, mechanical performance, and cell viability, offering a robust platform for uterine tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Saltatory targeting strategy in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how strategic leaps alter the classic rock-paper-scissors dynamics in spatially structured populations. In our model, individuals can expend energy reserves to jump toward regions with a high density of individuals of the species they dominate in the spatial game. This enables them to eliminate the target organisms and gain new territory, promoting species proliferation. Through stochastic, lattice-based simulations, we show that even when the energy allocated to jumping, as opposed to random walking, is low, there is a significant shift in the cyclic dominance balance. This arises from the increased likelihood of the leaping species successfully acquiring territory. Due to the cyclical nature of the game, the dominant species becomes the one that is superior to the jumping species. We investigate how spatial patterns are affected and calculate the changes in characteristic length scales. Additionally, we quantify how saltatory targeting reshapes spatial correlations and drives shifts in population dominance. Finally, we estimate the coexistence probability and find evidence that this behavioural strategy may promote biodiversity among low-mobility organisms but jeopardise long-term coexistence in the case of high-mobility dispersal. These results underscore the profound impact of novel foraging tactics on community structure and provide concrete parameters for ecologists seeking to incorporate behavioural innovation into ecosystem models.</description>

      <title>Thin active nematohydrodynamic layers: asymptotic theories and instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a three-dimensional description of an active nematic layer, we employ an asymptotic theory to derive a series of low-dimensional continuum models that capture the coupled dynamics of flat and curved films, including variations in film thickness, shape deformations, internal velocity fields, and the dynamics of orientational order.
  Using this asymptotic theory, we investigate instabilities driven by activity in both the nematic and isotropic phases for cylindrical and flat films. In the flat case, we demonstrate that incorporating shape and thickness variations fundamentally alters the bend and splay nature of instabilities compared to conventional two dimensional nematic instabilities. In the isotropic phase, we find that both extensile and contractile activity can induce nematic order, in contrast with active nematics on fixed surfaces, where only extensile activity leads to ordering. For the case of curved geometries such as a cylindrical film, we reveal that thickness and shape instabilities are inherently coupled. In the isotropic phase, the emergence of nematic order triggers both thickness and shape instabilities. In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces thickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations, and curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films beyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.</description>

      <title>Automatic Forward Model Parameterization with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of `turning on` the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally generalizes optimization to any differentiable forward model...</description>

      <title>Force Dipole Interactions in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct viscous fluid flow sourced by a force dipole embedded in a cylindrical fluid membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. We find analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a mutually perpendicular dipole pair move together along helical geodesics, thus acting as curvature checkers, analogous to vortex dipoles. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in nature, as well as in-vitro experiments (25).</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>
