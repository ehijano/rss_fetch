      <title>A Land of Oblique Duality for Frames and Probabilistic Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functions or distributions used to sample and to reconstruct signals often occur in different domains, like the Dirac delta and a band-limited bump function in classical sampling. Oblique dual frames generalize this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide new tools to study oblique dual frames and introduce a probabilistic variant of oblique dual frames. We first present the oblique dual frame potential and show that it is minimized precisely when the oblique dual coincides with the canonical oblique dual. We then define oblique dual probabilistic frames and oblique approximately dual probabilistic frames. In particular, we prove that for a given oblique dual probabilistic frame, the associated oblique dual probabilistic frame potential is minimized if and only if the frame is tight and the oblique dual is canonical. Moreover, the tightness assumption can be removed when the minimization is restricted to oblique dual probabilistic frames of pushforward type. Finally, we investigate perturbations of oblique dual probabilistic frames and show that if a probability measure is sufficiently close to an oblique dual probabilistic frame pair in the $2$-Wasserstein topology, then it forms an oblique approximately dual probabilistic frame.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, integral Gauss curvature of pseudo-cones is extended to the Orlicz setting and the corresponding Orlicz-Aleksandrov problem is studied.

      <title>Operators of Hilbert type acting on some spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H(\mathbb{D})$ be the space of all analytic functions in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$. For $g\in H(\mathbb{D})$, the generalized Hilbert operator $\mathcal{H}_{g}$ is defined by $$\mathcal{H}_{g}(f)(z)=\int_{0}^{1}f(t)g'(tz)dt, \ \ z\in \mathbb{D}, f\in H(\mathbb{D}).$$
  In this paper, we study the operator $\mathcal{H}_{g}$ acting on some spaces of analytic functions in $\mathbb{D}$. Specifically, we give a complete characterization of those $g\in H(\mathbb{D})$ for which the operator $\mathcal{H}_{g}$ is bounded (resp. compact) from the Dirichlet space $\mathcal{D}^{2}_{\alpha}$ to $\mathcal{D}^{2}_{\beta}$ for all possible indicators $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}$. We also study the action of the operator $\mathcal{H}_{g}$ on the space of bounded analytic functions $H^{\infty}$, which generalizes the known results for the classical Hilbert operator $\mathcal {H}$ acting on $H^{\infty}$. In particular, we consider the boundedness of the operator $\mathcal{H}_{g}$ with a symbol of non-negative Taylor coefficients, acting on logarithmic Bloch spaces and on Korenblum spaces. This work generalizes the corresponding results for the classical Hilbert operator.</description>

      <title>Generalized junction conditions for discontinuous metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the Darmois-Israel junction formalism is extended to the case of discontinuous metrics within the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions. This formulation provides a mathematically consistent treatment of nonlinear operations involving singular quantities, such as products and derivatives of distributions. By relaxing the usual continuity condition on the metric, the generalized junction conditions naturally include higher-order singular terms in the curvature and in the surface energy-momentum tensor. These additional contributions represent new geometric degrees of freedom associated with genuine discontinuities in the space-time geometry. The resulting formalism recovers the traditional Darmois-Israel conditions as a limiting case, while offering a coherent extension applicable to geometric boundaries and abrupt transitions in space-time.</description>

      <title>Dual characterizations of norm minimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies a general norm minimization problem on a product of normed vector spaces. We establish dual necessary and sufficient optimality conditions and derive explicit formulas for the corresponding solution sets. These formulas are obtained under the assumption that one optimal solution together with its associated dual vectors arising from the optimality conditions is known. Three important cases of product norms, namely the sum norm, maximum norm and $p$-norm, are also studied. Several examples in finite and infinite dimensional spaces equipped with various types of norms are presented to illustrate the established results.</description>

      <title>Optimization of maximal quantum f-divergences between unitary orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximal quantum $f$-divergences - defined via the commutant Radon-Nikodym derivative provide a fundamental measure of distinguishability between quantum states in the operator convex setting. In this work, we determine the exact extremal values of these divergences over the unitary orbits of two quantum states. Using the integral representation of operator convex functions, majorization theory, Lidskii-type inequalities, and structural properties of Kubo-Ando means, we derive fully explicit spectral formulas for \[ \min_{U\in \mathbb U_n} \tilde S_f(\rho\|U^{*}\sigma U) \quad\text{and}\quad \max_{U\in \mathbb U_n} \tilde S_f(\rho\|U^{*}\sigma U), \] and identify the unitaries achieving these extrema. We show that the optimization reduces to spectral rearrangement: the minimum occurs when the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are paired, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $\rho$ with the increasing spectrum of $\sigma$. Consequently, the full range of the divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval between these two endpoints. We further compare our results with the recent unitary optimization framework for hockey-stick-based quantum $f$-divergences of Li and Yan (2025), highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two families. Our findings extend prior extremal analyses for Umegaki, R\'enyi, and Hellinger-type divergences, and illuminate the distinct noncommutative nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences.</description>

      <title>Sampling recovery on classes defined by integral operators and sparse approximation with adaptive dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to develop the following general approach. We study asymptotic behavior of the errors of sampling recovery not for an individual smoothness class, how it is usually done, but for the collection of classes, which are defined by integral operators with kernels coming from a given class of functions. Earlier, such approach was realized for the Kolmogorov widths and very recently for the entropy numbers. It turns out that the above problem is closely related to the sparse approximation problem with respect to different redundant dictionaries. Specifically, the problem of sampling recovery is connected with sparse nonlinear approximation with respect to adaptive dictionaries, which means that the dictionary depends on the function under approximation.</description>

      <title>Examples of critically cyclic functions in the Dirichlet spaces of the ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct examples of holomorphic functions in $D_2(\B_2)$, the Dirichlet space on $\B_2$, for which there exists an index $\alpha_c \in [\frac12,2]$ such that the function is cyclic in $D_\alpha(\B_2)$ if and only if $\alpha \leq \alpha_c$. To this end, we use the notion of \emph{interpolation sets} in smooth ball algebras, as studied by Bruna, Ortega, Chaumat, and Chollet.</description>

      <title>Spectral Fusion Deformations for Locally Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deformation framework for $C^*$-algebras equipped with a coaction of a locally compact quantum group, formulated intrinsically at the level of spectral subspaces determined by the coaction. The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fr\'echet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.
  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.
  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction.</description>

      <title>A survey on sampling recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of unknown functions from a finite number of samples is a fundamental challenge in pure and applied mathematics. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in sampling recovery, focusing on the accuracy of various algorithms and the relationship between optimal recovery errors, nonlinear approximation, and the Kolmogorov widths of function classes. A central theme is the synergy between the theory of universal sampling discretization and Lebesgue-type inequalities for greedy algorithms. We discuss three primary algorithmic frameworks: weighted least squares and $\ell_p$ minimization, sparse approximation methods, and greedy algorithms such as the Weak Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (WOMP) in Hilbert spaces and the Weak Tchebychev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in Banach spaces. These methods are applied to function classes defined by structural conditions, like the $A_\beta^r$ and Wiener-type classes, as well as classical Sobolev-type classes with dominated mixed derivatives. Notably, we highlight recent findings showing that nonlinear sampling recovery can provide superior error guarantees compared to linear methods for certain multivariate function classes.</description>

      <title>Besselian Schauder Frames and the Structure of Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00777v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schauder bases are fundamental tools for analyzing the structure of Banach spaces. In this work, we show that Besselian Schauder frames (BSF) play a similar role in certain contexts. We first prove that every unconditional Schauder frame (USF) is BSF, but the reverse implication is false. Specifically, we extend several well-known results of Karlin and James to Banach spaces with BSF, particularly to those with USF. We prove that many classical Banach spaces do not admit BSF, and in particular, do not admit USF.
  Before establishing these results, for every Banach space $E$ with a finite dimensional decomposition, we provide an explicit method to construct a Schauder frame for $E$. In particular, Szarek's Banach space has a Schauder frame, which famously lacks a Schauder basis. This finding provides strong motivation for extending classical Schauder basis theory to the framework of Schauder frames.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequalities and Wiener--Stein theorem on p.c.f. fractals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a post-critically finite (p.c.f.) self-similar set with Hausdorff dimension $s$, and $\mu$ be a self-similar probability measure supported on $K$. Let $H^{\alpha}_\mu$, $0&lt;\alpha\le s$, be the Hausdorff content on $K$, and $M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu $ be the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator defined on $K$ associated with its basic cubes $\mathcal{D}$. In this paper, we establish quantitative strong type and weak type Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequalities on fractal set $K$ with respect to $H^{\alpha}_\mu$ for all range $0&lt;\alpha\le s$. As applications, the Lebesgue differentiation theorem on $K$ is proved. Moreover, via the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator $M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu $, we characterize the Lebesgue--Choquet space $L^p(K,H^{\alpha}_\mu)$ and the Zygmund space $L\log L(K,\mu)$. To be exact, given $\alpha/s&lt; p\le \infty$, we discover that \[ \text{$f\in L^p(K,H^{\alpha}_\mu)$ if and only if $M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu f\in L^p(K,H^{\alpha}_\mu)$}\] and, for $f\in L^1(K,\mu)$ with $K$ satisfying the strong separation condition, \[\text{$M_{\mathcal{D}}^\mu f\in L^1(K,\mu)$ if and only if $f\in L\log L(K,\mu)$}.\] That is, Wiener's $L\log L$ inequality and its converse inequality due to Stein in 1969 are extended to fractal set $K$ with respect to $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Rearrangement Invariant Orthogonal Sums in Krein Spaces. II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Part I of the paper considered infinite orthogonal sums of regular subspaces in a Krein space (that is, of subspaces which are themselves Krein spaces). How precisely these sums should be defined and conditions for when such a sum is itself regular were examined. These included, for example, a boundedness condition for the sum of the corresponding orthogonal projections. The same problem is addressed here for (quasi-)pseudo-regular subspaces. Such subspaces happen to be the orthogonal direct sum of a regular space and an isotropic, or neutral, subspace. Alternate characterizations of such subspaces are given, along with various examples and counter-examples. The infinite orthogonal sum of these is then considered.</description>

Abstract: Regarding the representation theorem of Kolmogorov and Arnold (KA) as an algorithm for representing or &lt;&lt;expressing&gt;&gt; functions, we test its robustness by analyzing its stability to withstand re-parameterizations of the hidden space. One may think of such re-parameterizations as the work of an adversary attempting to foil the construction of the KA outer function. We find KA to be stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations, but unearth a question about the equi-continuity of the outer functions that, so far, obstructs taking limits and defeating continuous groups of re-parameterizations. This question on the regularity of the outer functions is relevant to the debate over the applicability of KA to the general theory of NNs.</description>
