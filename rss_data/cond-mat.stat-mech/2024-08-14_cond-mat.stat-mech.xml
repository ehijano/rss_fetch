      <title>Improved Actions using The Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to study critical properties near classical and quantum phase transitions. Our method applies ideas of the Tensor Renormalization Group to obtain an improved action which is used to extract critical properties by performing Monte Carlo simulations on relatively small system sizes. We demonstrate this method on the XY model in three dimensions. Our method may provide a framework with which to efficiently study universal properties in a large class of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of entanglement between two Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity across a separatrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity are strategies for conserving adiabatic invariants under non-adiabatic (i.e. fast-driving) conditions. Here, we show how to extend classical, Hamiltonian shortcuts to adiabaticity to allow the crossing of a phase-space separatrix -- a situation in which a corresponding adiabatic protocol does not exist. Specifically, we show how to construct a time-dependent Hamiltonian that evolves one energy shell to another energy shell across a separatrix. Leveraging this method, we design an erasure procedure whose energy cost and fidelity do not depend on the protocol's duration.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <title>Application of the shift-invert Lanczos algorithm to a non-equilibrium Green function for transport problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Green's function theory and related methods are widely used to describe transport phenomena in many-body systems, but they often require a costly inversion of a large matrix. We show here that the shift-invert Lanczos method can dramatically reduce the computational effort. We apply the method to two test problems, namely a simple model Hamiltonian and to a more realistic Hamiltonian for nuclear fission. For a Hamiltonian of dimension 66103 we find that the computation time is reduced by a factor of 33 compared to the direct calculation of the Green's function.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Deep Learning for Strain Gradient Continuum Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a space-time discretization based on physics informed deep learning (PIDL) to approximate solutions of a class of rate-dependent strain gradient plasticity models. The differential equation governing the plastic flow, the so-called microforce balance for this class of yield-free plasticity models, is very stiff, often leading to numerical corruption and a consequent lack of accuracy or convergence by finite element (FE) methods. Indeed, setting up the discretized framework, especially with an elaborate meshing around the propagating plastic bands whose locations are often unknown a-priori, also scales up the computational effort significantly. Taking inspiration from physics informed neural networks, we modify the loss function of a PIDL model in several novel ways to account for the balance laws, either through energetics or via the resulting PDEs once a variational scheme is applied, and the constitutive equations. The initial and the boundary conditions may either be imposed strictly by encoding them within the PIDL architecture, or enforced weakly as a part of the loss function. The flexibility in the implementation of a PIDL technique often makes for its ready interface with powerful optimization schemes, and this in turn provides for many possibilities in posing the problem. We have used freely available open-source libraries that perform fast, parallel computations on GPUs. Using numerical illustrations, we demonstrate how PIDL methods could address the computational challenges posed by strain gradient plasticity models. Also, PIDL methods offer abundant potentialities, vis-\'a-vis a somewhat straitjacketed and poorer approximant of FE methods, in customizing the formulation as per the problem objective.</description>

Abstract: Exactly ergodicity in boundary-driven semi-infinite cellular automata (CA) are investigated. We establish all the ergodic rules in CA with 3, 4, and 5 states. We analytically prove the ergodicity for 12 rules in 3-state CA and 118320 rules in 5-state CA with any ergodic and periodic boundary condition, and numerically confirm all the other rules non-ergodic with some boundary condition. We classify ergodic rules into several patterns, which exhibit a variety of ergodic structure.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Excitations in the Diluted Two-dimensional S = 1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the excitation spectrum of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the randomly diluted square lattice by analytic continuation of QMC data. At dilution fractions $p=1/16$ and $p=1/8$, the dynamic structure factor $S({\bf q},\omega)$ exhibits a damped magnon peak with anomalous dispersion near ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$, a non-dispersive low-energy localization peak, and a second dispersive peak between these two features. A magnon with anomalous dispersion, close to our result, was predicted in spin wave and $T$-matrix theory [A. Chernyshev et al., PRB {\bf 65}, 104407 (2002)], above the localization energy. However, no intermediate dispersive mode was predicted. Analyzing spectral functions in real space for individual vacancy realizations by energy tomography, we find that these excitations are concentrated on a small subset of the spins adjacent to vacancies. We argue that the low-energy excitations are those of a sparse random network of effective moments at a fraction of the vacancies. There is a shift in magnon spectral weight distribution, from the spins away from vacancies at high energy to those adjacent to vacancies at lower energy. We also analyze the Anderson quantum rotor excitation at $\omega \propto N^{-1}$ (with $N=L^2$ the system size), which in the clean system is visible in $S({\bf q},\omega)$ only at ${\bf q}=(\pi,\pi)$ but spreads through the Brillouin zone when $p&gt;0$. Weight close to ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$ is explained by local sublattice imbalance within a dimer-monomer model but there is also structure arising from correlated singlet fluctuations, which we demonstrate by enhancing said fluctuations with four-spin couplings. All spectral features found here should be observable by elastic neutron scattering experiments on layered quantum antiferromagnets doped with nonmagnetic impurities.</description>

      <title>In pursuit of the tetratic phase in hard rectangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate two-dimensional systems of hard rectangles at constant pressure through extensive hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations. We determine the complete phase diagram as a function of packing fraction and aspect ratio, which consists of four distinct phases. At very high packing fractions, particles form a smectic solid for all aspect ratios. Rod-like particles with large aspect ratio assemble in an intervening nematic phase, which is displaced by a "tetratic" phase (also called biaxial nematic) for moderately elongated rectangles. Surprisingly, we find evidence that the transition from tetratic to smectic is weakly discontinuous at variance with previously proposed two-step scenarios for the melting of hard particles.</description>

      <title>Simple fluctuations in simple glass formers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical single-particle fluctuations associated with particle displacements are inherent to simple glass-forming liquids in the limit of large dimensions and leave a pseudo-critical trace across all finite dimensions. This characteristic could serve as a crucial test for distinguishing between theories of glass formation. We here examine these critical fluctuations, as captured by the well-established non-Gaussian parameter, within both mode-coupling theory (MCT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) across dimensions for hard sphere liquids and for the minimally structured Mari--Kurchan model. We establish general scaling laws relevant to any liquid dynamics theory in large dimensions and show that the dimensional scalings predicted by MCT are inconsistent with those from DMFT. Simulation results for hard spheres in moderately high dimensions align with the DMFT scenario, reinforcing the relevance of mean-field theory for capturing glass physics in finite dimensions. We identify potential adjustments to MCT to account for certain mean-field physics. Our findings also highlight that local structure and spatial dimensionality can affect single-particle critical fluctuations in non-trivial ways.</description>

      <title>Decay of long-lived oscillations after quantum quenches in gapped interacting quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of long-lived oscillations in the expectation values of local observables after quantum quenches has recently attracted considerable attention in relation to weak ergodicity breaking. Here we focus on an alternative mechanism that gives rise to such oscillations in a class of systems that support kinematically protected gapped excitations at zero temperature. An open question in this context is whether such oscillations will ultimately decay. We resolve this issue by considering spin models that can be mapped to systems of weakly interacting fermions, which in turn are amenable to an analysis by standard methods based on the BBGKY hierarchy. We find that there is a time scale beyond which the oscillations start to decay, which grows as the strength of the quench is made small.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
  We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated particle motion in biased correlated Gaussian disorder potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermally activated particle motion in disorder potentials is controlled by the large-$\Delta V$ tail of the distribution of height $\Delta V$ of the potential barriers created by the disorder. We employ the optimal fluctuation method to evaluate this tail for correlated quenched Gaussian potentials in one dimension in the presence of a small bias of the potential. We focus on the mean escape time (MET) of overdamped particles averaged over the disorder. We show that the bias leads to a strong (exponential) reduction of the MET in the direction along the bias. The reduction depends both on the bias, and on detailed properties of the covariance of the disorder, such as its derivatives and asymptotic behavior at large distances. We verify our theoretical predictions for the large-$\Delta V$ tail of the barrier height distribution, as well as earlier predictions of this tail for zero bias, by performing large-deviation simulations of the potential disorder. The simulations employ correlated random potential sampling based on the circulant embedding method and the Wang-Landau algorithm, which enable us to probe probability densities smaller than $10^{-1200}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the structure of systems in nonequilibrium steady states necessitates tools that quantify population shifts and associated deformations of equilibrium free energy landscapes under persistent currents. Within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, we establish a variant of the Kawasaki-Crooks equality that relates nonequilibrium free energy corrections in overdamped Langevin systems to heat dissipation statistics along time-reversed relaxation trajectories computable with molecular simulation. Using stochastic control theory, we arrive at a general variational approach to evaluate the Kawasaki-Crooks equality, and use it to estimate distribution functions of order parameters in specific models of driven and active matter, attaining substantial improvement in accuracy over simple perturbative methods.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and fluctuations of a mass- and dipole-conserving stochastic lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Han et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, 137102 (2024)] have recently introduced a classical stochastic lattice gas model which, in addition to particle conservation, also conserves the particles' dipole moment. Because of its intrinsic nonlinearity this model exhibits unusual macroscopic scaling behaviors, different from those of lattice gases that conserve only the number of particles. Here we investigate some basic relaxation and fluctuation properties of this model at large scales and at long times. These properties crucially depend on whether the total number of particles is infinite or finite. We find similarity solutions, describing relaxation of the dipole-conserving gas (DCG) in several standard settings. A major part of our effort is an extension to this model of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT), previously developed for lattice gases where only the number of particles is conserved. We apply the MFT to the calculation of the variance of nonequilibrium fluctuations of the excess number of particles on the positive semi-axis when starting from an (either deterministic, or random) constant density at $t=0$. Using the MFT, we also identify the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the DCG. Finally, based on these results, we determine the probability distribution of, and the most probable density history leading to, a large deviation in the form of a macroscopic void of a given size in an initially uniform DCG at equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: This work demonstrates how first-principles thermodynamic research within a Bayesian framework can quantify and propagate uncertainties to downstream thermodynamic calculations. To address the issue of Bayesian prior selection, knowledge of zero Kelvin ground states in the material system of interest is incorporated into the prior. The effectiveness of this framework is shown by creating a phase diagram for the FCC Zirconium Nitride system, including confidence intervals on phase boundary regions of interest.</description>

      <title>Operator formalism for discretely holomorphic parafermions of the two-color Ashkin-Teller, loop $\mathrm{O} ( 1 )$, staggered eight-vertex, odd eight-vertex, and abelian sandpile models</title>

Abstract: We extend an operator formalism, developed by Hongler, Kyt\"ol\"a, and Zahabi in 2012 for the Ising model, to the Ashkin-Teller and loop $\mathrm{O} ( n ) $ models. The formalism is primarily dependent upon notions of massive, and massless, s-holomorphicity of the Ising model, which are respectively satisfied at, and below, the critical temperature, hence allowing for rigorous analyses of the transfer matrix, correlation functions, and lattice fermion operators. From results of another paper, by Tanhayi-Ahari and Rouhani in 2012, which demonstrates that parafermionic observables for the staggered eight-vertex model coincide with those of the Ashkin-Teller model, as well as a 2003 paper, by Wu and Kunz, which establishes a correspondence between the staggered eight-vertex and odd eight-vertex models, we establish further associations.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effects in nonequilibrium open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect was originally referred to as the faster icing of a higher-temperature system than a lower-temperature system, and was later generalized to anomalous decays of both classical and quantum observables to equilibrium states. Mpemba effect is mostly considered in classical systems and during cooling processes towards equilibrium states. We investigate the emergence of the effect in nonequilibrium quantum systems where the system has no asymptotic equilibrium state to approach. Instead, the system is put in contact with two different baths, and only a nonequilibrium state exists, sustained by constant energy injection from the surrounding thermal baths. Firstly, we show that the nonequilibrium conditions can dramatically enlarge the parameter regimes where the MPE emerges. Secondly, we demonstrate that the anomalous MPEs and inverse MPEs emerge in the evolution of quantum correlations in the two-site fermionic system and that nonequilibrium conditions can expedite or delay the MPEs. Thirdly, we show that the nonequilibrium-induced quantum coherence can have considerable contributions to the emergence of the MPE which the conventional Lindbladian dynamics fails to capture.</description>

      <title>Theory of Coulomb driven nematicity in a multi-valley two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a semiconductor host with two valleys related by an underlying $C_4$ rotational symmetry are studied using Hartree-Fock (HF) and various other many-body approaches. A familiar artifact of the HF approach is a degeneracy between the valley polarized - ``Ising nematic'' - and spin polarized - ferromagnetic - phases, which is inconsistent with recent variational Monte Carlo (VMC) results. Correlation effects, computed either within the random phase approximation (RPA) or the T-matrix approximation, enhance the valley susceptibility relative to the spin susceptibility. Extrapolating the results to finite interaction strength, we find a direct first-order transition from a symmetry-unbroken state to a spin unpolarized Ising nematic fluid with full valley polarization, in qualitative agreement with VMC. The RPA results are also reminiscent of experiments on the corresponding 2DEG in AlAs heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling solution for a rigidity transition: renormalization group flows near the upper critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rigidity transitions induced by the formation of system-spanning disordered rigid clusters, like the jamming transition, can be well-described in most physically relevant dimensions by mean-field theories. A dynamical mean-field theory commonly used to study these transitions, the coherent potential approximation (CPA), shows logarithmic corrections in $2$ dimensions. By solving the theory in arbitrary dimensions and extracting the universal scaling predictions, we show that these logarithmic corrections are a symptom of an upper critical dimension $d_{u}=2$, below which the critical exponents are modified. We recapitulate Ken Wilson's phenomenology of the $(4-\epsilon)$-dimensional Ising model, but with the upper critical dimension reduced to $2$. We interpret this using normal form theory as a transcritical bifurcation in the RG flows and extract the universal nonlinear coefficients to make explicit predictions for the behavior near $2$ dimensions. This bifurcation is driven by a variable that is dangerously irrelevant in all dimensions $d&gt;2$ which incorporates the physics of long-wavelength phonons and low-frequency elastic dissipation. We derive universal scaling functions from the CPA sufficient to predict all linear response in randomly diluted isotropic elastic systems in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Uncontrolled learning: co-design of neuromorphic hardware topology for neuromorphic algorithms</title>

Abstract: Hardware-based neuromorphic computing remains an elusive goal with the potential to profoundly impact future technologies and deepen our understanding of emergent intelligence. The learning-from-mistakes algorithm is one of the few training algorithms inspired by the brain's simple learning rules, utilizing inhibition and pruning to demonstrate self-organized learning. Here we implement this algorithm in purely neuromorphic memristive hardware through a co-design process. This implementation requires evaluating hardware trade-offs and constraints. It has been shown that learning-from-mistakes successfully trains small networks to function as binary classifiers and perceptrons. However, without tailoring the hardware to the algorithm, performance decreases exponentially as the network size increases. When implementing neuromorphic algorithms on neuromorphic hardware, we investigate the trade-offs between depth, controllability, and capacity, the latter being the number of learnable patterns. We emphasize the significance of topology and the use of governing equations, demonstrating theoretical tools to aid in the co-design of neuromorphic hardware and algorithms. We provide quantitative techniques to evaluate the computational capacity of a neuromorphic device based on the measurements performed and the underlying circuit structure. This approach shows that breaking the symmetry of a neural network can increase both the controllability and average network capacity. By pruning the circuit, neuromorphic algorithms in all-memristive device circuits leverage stochastic resources to drive local contrast in network weights. Our combined experimental and simulation efforts explore the parameters that make a network suited for displaying emergent intelligence from simple rules.</description>
