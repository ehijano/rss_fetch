      <title>Adaptive and Regime-Aware RL for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a regime-aware reinforcement learning framework for long-horizon portfolio optimization. Moving beyond traditional feedforward and GARCH-based models, we design realistic environments where agents dynamically reallocate capital in response to latent macroeconomic regime shifts. Agents receive hybrid observations and are trained using constrained reward functions that incorporate volatility penalties, capital resets, and tail-risk shocks. We benchmark multiple architectures, including PPO, LSTM-based PPO, and Transformer PPO, against classical baselines such as equal-weight and Sharpe-optimized portfolios. Our agents demonstrate robust performance under financial stress. While Transformer PPO achieves the highest risk-adjusted returns, LSTM variants offer a favorable trade-off between interpretability and training cost. The framework promotes regime-adaptive, explainable reinforcement learning for dynamic asset allocation.</description>

      <title>Robust Utility Optimization via a GAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust utility optimization enables an investor to deal with market uncertainty in a structured way, with the goal of maximizing the worst-case outcome. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to (approximately) solve robust utility optimization problems in general and realistic settings. In particular, we model both the investor and the market by neural networks (NN) and train them in a mini-max zero-sum game. This approach is applicable for any continuous utility function and in realistic market settings with trading costs, where only observable information of the market can be used. A large empirical study shows the versatile usability of our method. Whenever an optimal reference strategy is available, our method performs on par with it and in the (many) settings without known optimal strategy, our method outperforms all other reference strategies. Moreover, we can conclude from our study that the trained path-dependent strategies do not outperform Markovian ones. Lastly, we uncover that our generative approach for learning optimal, (non-) robust investments under trading costs generates universally applicable alternatives to well known asymptotic strategies of idealized settings.</description>
