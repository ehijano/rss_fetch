      <title>Phase-space Generalized Brillouin Zone for spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) has been highly successful in characterizing the topology and band structure of non-Hermitian systems. However, its applicability has been challenged in spatially inhomogeneous settings, where the non-locality of non-Hermitian pumping competes with Wannier-Stark localization and quantum interference, potentially leading to highly non-exponential state accumulation. To transcend this major conceptual bottleneck, we develop a general phase-space GBZ formalism that encodes non-Bloch deformations in both position and momentum space, such as to accurately represent spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian pumping. A key new phenomenon is the bifurcation of the phase-space GBZ branches, which allows certain eigenstates to jump abruptly between different GBZ solutions at various points in real space. The freedom in the locations of such jumps opens up an emergent degree of freedom that protects the stability of real spectra and, more impressively, the robustness of a new class of topological zero modes unique to GBZ bifurcation.The response from these novel spectral and GBZ singularities can be readily demonstrated in mature metamaterial platforms such as photonic crystals or circuit arrays, where effective real-space hoppings can be engineered in a versatile manner.Our framework directly generalizes to more complicated unit cells and further hoppings, opening up a vast new arena for exploring unconventional spectral and topological transitions as well as GBZ fragmentation in spatially inhomogeneous non-Hermitian settings.</description>

      <title>Wave dynamics in a macroscopic square artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A macroscopic square artificial spin ice, or macro-ASI, is a collection of bar magnets placed in a square lattice arrangement. Each magnet is supported by hinges that allow their mechanical rotation. Previous investigations in these structures have shown ground-state configurations and driven dynamics similar to those of their nanosized counterparts. Here, we numerically investigate the impact of a defect, a Dirac string, on the driven dynamics. We find that waves quickly lose coherence by scattering between modes in this system. In addition, we observe a distinct mode associated with the isolated oscillation of the Dirac string. As expected from spatial localization, this resonant mode is under the band of propagating waves in the macro-ASI. The results are analogous to the development of low-frequency edge modes in nanoscopic spin ices in the presence of defects. Our results provide valuable insight into the physics of mechano-magnetic systems, demonstrating the existence of wave scattering and spatial confinement phenomena in macro-ASIs.</description>

      <title>Hall Coefficient of the Intercalated Graphite CaC$_6$ in the Uniaxial CDW Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the Hall coefficient characterising magnetotransport in an intercalated graphite CaC$_6$ with the Fermi surface reconstructed by an uniaxial charge density wave from closed pockets to open sheets. As the typical order parameter, corresponding to the pseudo-gap in electronic spectrum and consequently to spacing between electron trajectories in reciprocal space, is of the order of $10^2$K, magnetic breakdown in strong experimentally achievable fields of the order of 10T is inevitable. The classical expressions for the components of the magnetoconductivity tensor are strongly modified by magnetic field-assisted over-gap tunneling causing quantum interference. Due to magnetic breakdown, all magnetoconductivity components undergo strong quantum oscillations reflected in the Hall coefficient. In their nature, these are different than standard Shubnikov de Haas oscillations which would not appear in a system with an open Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of the ground state for the antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic Ising model on a triangular lattice (AFIT) exemplifies the most classical frustration system, arising from its triangular geometry that prevents all interactions from being simultaneously satisfied. Understanding geometric frustration in AFIT is crucial for advancing our knowledge of materials science and complex phases of matter. Here, we present a simple platform to study AFIT by arranging cylindrical magnets in vertical cavities of a triangular lattice, where magnets can slide along the cavity axis and stabilize either at the bottom or at the top of the cavity, analogous to the bistability of the Ising spin. The strong interactions of the magnets and the unique growing process allow the frustrated behavior and its ground state configurations to be directly observed. Notably, we observe a curved stripe phase, which is exotic to the Ising model. An effective thermalization process is developed to minimize the interaction energy, facilitating the evolution of various magnetic states, thereby visually realizing the ground state antiferromagnetic Ising model. Theoretical simulations and machine learning are performed concurrently to reveal the ground state and its evolution under effective thermal fluctuations, which are remarkably consistent with experimental results. Our system provides a unique platform to study frustrated systems and pave the way for future explorations in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Topological-to-Topological Transition Induced by On-Site Nonlinearity in a One-Dimensional Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have extended the notion of band topology to nonlinear systems by defining nonlinear counterparts of eigenvalue problems. They have found the nonlinearity-induced topological transition, while it has required complicated nonlinearity such as off-diagonal one. Thus, the existence of nonlinearity-induced transitions has been unclear under homogeneous on-site nonlinearity, which is ubiquitously found in nature. We here reveal that such on-site nonlinearity can induce transitions of topological modes, where topological modes converging to zero begin to converge to nonzero values. Since such nonlinearity-induced transition remains the bulk band topology unchanged, we can regard it as a transition from a conventional topological mode to one unique to nonlinear systems. We analyze a nonlinear eigenvalue problem by rewriting it to a dynamical system in the spatial direction and clarify that the nonlinearity-induced transition is a result of the bifurcation in the spatial dynamics. We also propose a possible setup to observe the nonlinearity-induced transition that uses a gradual amplification of nonlinear waves. These results provide a general designing principle of topological insulators controlled by nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Transport characterization and quantum dot coupling in commercial 22FDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different groups worldwide have been working with the GlobalFoundries 22nm platform (22FDX) with the hopes of industrializing the fabrication of Si spin qubits. To guide this effort, we have performed a systematic study of six of the foundry's processes of reference (POR). Using effective mobility as a figure of merit, we study the impact of gate stack, channel type and back bias as a function of temperature. This screening process selected qubit devices that allowed us to couple quantum dots along both the length and width of the Si channel. We present stability diagrams with clear and regular honeycomb patterns, where spurious elements such as dopants are not observed. By combining these results with room and low temperature simulations, we provide insights into potential technology optimizations and show both the utility of qubit pre-screening protocols as well as the advantages of leveraging forward body bias within an FDSOI (Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator) qubit platform.</description>

      <title>Intense Laser-Driven Phenomena In Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed-matter provides attractive platforms to realize exotic particles, originally proposed in high-energy physics. Weyl semimetal (WSM) is a material in which low-energy collective excitations are governed by massless Weyl fermions, which appear in pairs of opposite chirality and are topologically protected. Thus, the discovery of topological materials such as WSM has heralded a new era in contemporary physics. Moreover, these materials offer exciting opportunities in next-generation signal processing and optoelectronics. This thesis explores different facets of the intense laser-driven phenomena in WSM for applications in emerging lightwave-driven Petahertz electronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Photonic chiral state transfer near the Liouvillian exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As branch-point singularities of non-Hermitian matrices, the exceptional points (EPs) exhibit unique spectral topology and criticality, with intriguing dynamic consequences in non-Hermitian settings. In open quantum systems, EPs also emerge in the Liouvillian spectrum, but their dynamic impact often pertains to the transient dynamics and is challenging to demonstrate. Here, using the flexible control afforded by single-photon interferometry, we study the chiral state transfer when the Liouvillian EP is parametrically encircled. Reconstructing the density-matrix evolution by experimentally simulating the quantum Langevin equation, we show that the chirality of the dynamics is only present within an intermediate encircling timescale and dictated by the landscape of the Liouvillian spectrum near the EP. However, the chirality disappears at long times as the system always relaxes to the steady state. We then demonstrate the universal scaling of the chirality with respect to the encircling time. Our experiment confirms the transient nature of chiral state transfer near a Liouvillian EP in open quantum systems, while our scheme paves the way for simulating general open-system dynamics using single photons.</description>

      <title>Polarons in atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments. Our work highlights the open problems, identifies new research directions and provides a comprehensive framework for this rapidly evolving research field.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of vectorial torques in thin 3d Co ferromagnet using orbital-spin conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent findings in orbitronics pointed out large current-induced torques originating, in the current understanding, from incident orbital currents. These are generated by orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect (OREE) produced at the interface between some light metal and oxides films e.g. by naturally oxidized copper layer (Cu*). In the present work, by using second harmonic Hall techniques, we determine the ratio of orbital vs spin currents exerting torques on thin transition metals Co ferromagnet in systems using an orbit-to-spin Pt converter as interlayer with Cu*. Our results quantifying damping like torques show that both orbital and spin currents are enhanced in these systems. Moreover, the experimental determination of the decoherence length in a sample series with varying Co thickness clearly demonstrates the interfacial generation of the orbital currents in Cu* by Orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects (REE) leading to subsequent magnetic torque in Co over a typical lengthscale of several nanometers</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Terbium monohalide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the successful experimental realization of the long-sought Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Based on density functional theory + HSE hybrid functional, we identify the topological properties with Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is weakly staked by the QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, and exhibits the QAH effect corresponding to the Chern number $C=-1$. The topological band gap is significantly large and reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. Meanwhile, the magnetic study finds that the extended $5d$ electrons contribute to the magnetic momentum of Tb and lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c \sim 457$K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-adapted closest Wannier modeling based on complete multipole basis set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a method to construct a symmetry-adapted Wannier tight-binding model based on the closest Wannier formalism and the symmetry-adapted multipole theory. Since the symmetry properties of the closest Wannier functions are common to those of the original atomic orbitals, symmetry-adapted multipole basis (SAMB) can be defined as the complete orthonormal matrix basis set in the Hilbert space of the closest Wannier functions. Utilizing the completeness and orthonormality of SAMBs, the closest Wannier Hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of SAMBs belonging to the identity irreducible representation, thereby fully restoring the symmetry of the system. Moreover, the linear coefficients of each SAMB (model parameters) related to crystalline electric fields, spin-orbit coupling, and electron hoppings are determined through simple matrix projection without any iterative procedure. Thus, this method allows us to unveil mutual interplay among hidden electronic multipole degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian and numerically evaluate them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by modeling monolayer graphene under a perpendicular electric field, highlighting its utility in symmetrizing the closest Wannier model, quantifying symmetry breaking, and predicting unusual responses. The method is implemented in the open-source Python library SymClosestWannier, with the codes available on GitHub (https://github.com/CMT-MU/SymClosestWannier).</description>

      <title>First-principles study of electronic and magnetic properties of self-intercalated van der Waals magnet Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, characterized by self-intercalating native atoms into van der Waals layered structures with intrinsic magnetism, exhibit a variety of novel physical properties. Here, using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we report a self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which has a high Curie temperature of 492 K. We find that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is nearly half-metallic with a spin polarization reaching up to 90.9%. Due to the ferromagnetism and strong spin-orbit coupling effect in Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, a large anomalous Hall conductivity of 138 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and 305 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ can be realized when its magnetization is along its magnetic easy axis and hard axis, respectively. By doping electrons (holes) into Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, these anomalous Hall conductivities can be increased up to 318 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (648 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$). Interestingly, a 5-layer Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ thin film retains the room-temperature ferromagnetism with a higher spin polarization and larger anomalous Hall conductivity. Our work demonstrates that Cr$_3$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ is a novel room-temperature self-intercalated ferromagnet with high spin polarization and large anomalous Hall conductivity, offering great opportunities for designing nano-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical response of noncollinear spin systems at constrained magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncollinear magnets are notoriously difficult to describe within first-principles approaches based on density-functional theory (DFT) because of the presence of low-lying spin excitations. At the level of ground-state calculations, several methods exist to constrain the magnetic moments to a predetermined configuration, and thereby accelerate convergence towards self-consistency. Their use in a perturbative context, however, remains very limited. Here we present a general methodological framework to achieve parametric control over the local spin moments at the linear-response level. Our strategy builds on the concept of Legendre transform to switch between various flavors of magnetic functionals, and to relate their second derivatives via simple linear-algebra operations. Thereby, we can address an arbitrary response function at the time-dependent DFT level of theory with optimal accuracy and minimal computational effort. In the low frequency limit, we identify the leading correction to the existing adiabatic formulation of the problem [S. Ren \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev.

      <title>Diffraction of Light from Optical Fourier Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive surfaces shape optical wavefronts for applications in spectroscopy, high-speed communication, and imaging. The performance of these structures is primarily determined by how precisely they can be patterned. Fabrication constraints commonly lead to square-shaped, "binary" profiles that contain unwanted spatial frequencies that contaminate the diffraction. Recently, "wavy" surfaces (known as optical Fourier surfaces, OFSs) have been introduced that include only the desired spatial frequencies. However, the optical performance and reliability of these structures have not yet been experimentally tested with respect to models and simulations. Such a quantitative investigation could also provide previously unobtainable information about the diffraction process from the most fundamental diffractive surfaces$\unicode{x2014}$sinusoidally pure profiles. Here, we produce and study two classes of reflective OFSs: (i) single-sinusoidal profiles of varying depth and (ii) double-sinusoidal profiles with varying relative phase. After refining our fabrication procedure to obtain larger and deeper OFSs at higher yields, we find that the measured optical responses from our OFSs agree quantitatively with full electrodynamic simulations. In contrast, our measurements diverge from analytical scalar diffraction models routinely used by researchers to describe diffraction. Overall, our results confirm that OFSs provide a precise and powerful platform for Fourier-spectrum engineering, satisfying the growing demand for intricately patterned interfaces for applications in holography, augmented reality, and optical computing.</description>

      <title>Defect bound states in the continuum of bilayer electronic materials without symmetry protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a class of bound defect states in the continuum electronic spectrum of bilayer materials, which emerge independent of symmetry protection or additional degrees of freedom. Taking graphene as a prototypical example, our comparative analysis of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene demonstrates that these states originate from the intrinsic algebraic structure of the tight-binding Hamiltonian when trigonal warping is neglected rather than any underlying symmetry. Inclusion of trigonal warping and higher-order hoppings broaden the bound states into long-lived resonances. This discovery provides a pathway to previously unexplored approaches in defect and band-structure engineering. We conclude with a proposed protocol for observing these states in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer moir\'e materials can exhibit topological electronic features yet are inherently quasiperiodic -- leading to wave function interference whose Anderson-localizing tendency can be mitigated by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials that serves as a toy model for twisted trilayer. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>The fate of poor man's Majoranas in the long Kitaev chain limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of modified Kane-Mele-Rashba models via local spin Chern marker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we use the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) recently introduced by Ba\`{u} and Marrazzo [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054203 (2024)] to analyze the topology of the ground-state electronic wave functions in a finite honeycomb lattice flake described by three distinct models. The models considered here are characterized by strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which leads to non-conservation of the spin operator, i.e., $[\mathcal{H},\hat{s}_z]\neq 0$. The three spin-orbit couplings associated with the topological aspects of the models are: 1) Standard Kane-Mele coupling, 2) Sublattice-dependent Kane-Mele coupling, and 3) In-plane ($\hat{s}_y$) polarized Kane-Mele coupling. These couplings occur in graphene grown on suitable substrates and are relevant for modeling its van der Waals heterostructures. A particular topological phase diagram characterizes each of these spin-orbit interactions, and our calculations of LSCM successfully capture its general features. We also performed a detailed analysis of the spectral properties of the energy and valence-projected spin matrix eigenvalues, which shows that both exhibit a gap that protects the marker. Our results expand the applicability of the spin Chern number method to a class of Hamiltonians with experimental relevance and may contribute to future research on the real-space topology of realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Pauli spin blockade at room temperature in double-quantum-dot tunneling transport through individual deep dopants in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.</description>

      <title>Imaging the transition from diffusive to Landauer resistivity dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A point-like defect in a uniform current-carrying conductor induces a dipole in the electrochemical potential, which counteracts the original transport field. If the mean free path of the carriers is much smaller than the size of the defect, the dipole results from the purely diffusive motion of the carriers around the defect. In the opposite limit, ballistic carriers scatter from the defect $-$ for this situation Rolf Landauer postulated the emergence of a residual resistivity dipole (RRD) that is independent of the defect size and thus imposes a fundamental limit on the resistance of the parent conductor in the presence of defects. Here, we study resistivity dipoles around holes of different sizes in two-dimensional Bi films on Si(111). Using scanning tunneling potentiometry to image the dipoles in real space, we find a transition from linear to constant scaling behavior for small hole sizes, manifesting the transition from diffusive to Landauer dipoles. The extracted parameters of the transition allow us to estimate the Fermi wave vector and the carrier mean free path in our Bi films.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 114 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi level, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring the large AHE in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.</description>
