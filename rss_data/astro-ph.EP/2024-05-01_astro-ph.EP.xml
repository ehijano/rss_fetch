      <title>Gas, not dust: Migration of TESS/Gaia hot Jupiters possibly halted by the magnetospheres of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) The presence of short-period (&lt; 10 days) planets around main sequence (MS) stars has been associated either with the dust-destruction region or with the magnetospheric gas-truncation radius in the protoplanetary disks that surround them during the pre-MS phase. However, previous analyses have only considered low-mass FGK stars, making it difficult to disentangle the two scenarios. This exploratory study is aimed at testing whether it is the inner dust or gas disk driving the location of short-period, giant planets. By combining TESS and Gaia DR3 data, we identified a sample of 47 intermediate-mass (1.5-3 M$_{\odot}$) MS stars hosting confirmed and firm candidate hot Jupiters. We compared their orbits with the rough position of the inner dust and gas disks, which are well separated around their Herbig stars precursors. We also made a comparison with the orbits of confirmed hot Jupiters around a similarly extracted TESS/Gaia sample of low-mass sources (0.5-1.5 M$_{\odot}$). Our results suggest that the inner gas (and not the dust) disk limits the innermost orbits of hot Jupiters around intermediate-mass stars. These findings also provide tentative support to previous works that have claimed this is indeed the case for low-mass sources. We propose that hot Jupiters could be explained via a combination of the core-accretion paradigm and migration up to the gas-truncation radius, which may be responsible for halting inward migration regardless of the stellar mass regime. Larger samples of intermediate-mass stars with hot Jupiters are necessary to confirm our hypothesis, which implies that massive Herbig stars without magnetospheres (&gt; 3-4 M$_{\odot}$) may be the most efficient in swallowing their newborn planets.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal drift in eccentric disks: possible outward migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial drift of solid particles in the protoplanetary disk is often invoked as a threat to planet formation, as it removes solid material from the disk before it can be assembled into planets. However, it may also concentrate solids at particular locations in the disk, thus accelerating the coagulation process. Planetesimals are thought to drift much faster in an eccentric disk, due to their higher velocities with respect to the gas, but their drift rate has only been calculated using approximate means. In this work, we show that in some cases, previous estimates of the drift rate, based on a modification of the results for an axisymmetric disk, are highly inaccurate. In particular, we find that under some easily realized circumstances, planetesimals may drift outwards, rather than inwards. This results in the existence of radii in the disk that act as stable attractors of planetesimals. We show that this can lead to a local enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the surface density of planetesimals, even when a wide dispersion of planetesimal size is considered.</description>

      <title>Migration of Accreting Planets and Black Holes in Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk (PPD) via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in AGN disks. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, in all of our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($\Delta\dot M$ and $\Delta\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that extra caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of crystalline silicates in protoplanetary disks: How to interpret mid-infrared observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline silicates are an important tracer to the dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. In the inner disk, amorphous silicates are annealed by the high temperatures. These crystalline silicates are radially and vertically distributed in the disk. We aim to model the spatial distribution of crystalline silicate in the disk and its mid-IR spectra to study the effect on dust spectral features and to compare these to observations. We modeled a T-Tauri protoplanetary disk and defined the crystallization region from the crystallization and residence timescales. Radial mixing and drift were compared to find a vertically mixed region. We used the DISKLAB code to obtain the spatial distribution of the crystalline silicates, and MCMax code to model the mid-infrared spectrum. In our modeled disk, different grain sizes get crystallized in different regions in the disk. Crystallized dust in the disk surface is well mixed with the midplane due to vertical mixing and gets distributed to the outer disk by radial transport. Our model shows different contributions of the disk zones to the dust spectral features. Feature strengths change when varying the spatial distribution of crystalline dust. Our modeled spectra qualitatively agree with observations, but the modeled 10 $\mu$m feature is strongly dominated by crystalline dust. Models with reduced crystallinity and depletion of small crystalline dust in the inner disk show a better match with observations. Mid-IR observations of the disk surface represent the radial distribution of small dust in the midplane and provide us with dust properties in the inner disk. The inner and outer disks contribute more to shorter and longer wavelength features, respectively. Amorphization, sublimation, and dust evolution have to be considered to match observations. This study could interpret the spectra of protoplanetary disks taken with the MIRI on board the JWST.</description>

      <title>Contribution of PRIDE VLBI products to the joint JUICE-Europa Clipper moons' ephemerides solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the coming decade, JUICE and Europa Clipper radio-science will yield the most accurate estimation to date of the Galilean moons' physical parameters and ephemerides. JUICE's PRIDE (Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment) will help achieve such a solution by providing VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) observations of the spacecraft's lateral position, complementing nominal radio-science measurements. We quantify how PRIDE VLBI can contribute to the moons' ephemerides determination, in terms of attainable solution improvement and validation opportunities. To this end, we simulated both single- and dual-spacecraft VLBI, exploiting the potential simultaneous tracking of JUICE and Europa Clipper. We considered various tracking and data quality scenarios, and compared the formal uncertainties obtained with and without VLBI. This was performed for both global and local (i.e., per-flyby) estimations of the moons' states, as achieving a global solution first requires proceeding arc-per-arc. We showed that both single- and dual-spacecraft VLBI only bring limited improvement to the global state estimation, but significantly contribute to the moons' normal points (i.e., local states at flyby times), most notably in the out-of-plane direction. Additionally, we designed a validation plan exploiting PRIDE VLBI to progressively validate the classical radio-science solution. By improving the local state estimations and offering various validation opportunities, PRIDE will be invaluable in overcoming possible dynamical modelling challenges. It can therefore play a key role in reconstructing a global solution for the Galilean moons' dynamics with the uncertainty levels promised by JUICE-Europa Clipper analyses. This, in turn, is critical to the accurate characterisation of tidal dissipation in the Jovian system, holding the key to the long-term evolution of the Galilean moons.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam Detection of the Fomalhaut C Debris Disk in Scattered Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of debris disks offer important insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Though M dwarfs make up approximately 80% of nearby stars, very few M-dwarf debris disks have been studied in detail -- making it unclear how or if the information gleaned from studying debris disks around more massive stars extends to the more abundant M dwarf systems. We report the first scattered-light detection of the debris disk around the M4 star Fomalhaut C using JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam; 3.6$~\mu$m and 4.4$~\mu$m). This result adds to the prior sample of only four M-dwarf debris disks with detections in scattered light, and marks the latest spectral type and oldest star among them. The size and orientation of the disk in these data are generally consistent with the prior ALMA sub-mm detection. Though no companions are identified, these data provide strong constraints on their presence -- with sensitivity sufficient to recover sub-Saturn mass objects in the vicinity of the disk. This result illustrates the unique capability of JWST for uncovering elusive M-dwarf debris disks in scattered light, and lays the groundwork for deeper studies of such objects in the 2--5$~\mu$m regime.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in externally FUV irradiated disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars are born in stellar clusters and their protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplaces of planets, can therefore be affected by the radiation of nearby massive stars. However, little is known about the chemistry of externally irradiated disks, including whether or not their properties are similar to the so-far better-studied isolated disks. Motivated by this question, we present ALMA Band 6 observations of two irradiated Class II protoplanetary disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to explore the chemical composition of disks exposed to (external) FUV radiation fields: the 216-0939 disk and the binary system 253-1536A/B, which are exposed to radiation fields of $10^2-10^3$ times the average interstellar radiation field. We detect lines from CO isotopologues, HCN, H$_2$CO, and C$_2$H toward both protoplanetary disks. Based on the observed disk-integrated line fluxes and flux ratios, we do not find significant differences between isolated and irradiated disks. The observed differences seem to be more closely related to the different stellar masses than to the external radiation field. This suggests that these disks are far enough away from the massive Trapezium stars, that their chemistry is no longer affected by external FUV radiation. Additional observations towards lower-mass disks and disks closer to the massive Trapezium stars are required to elucidate the level of external radiation required to make an impact on the chemistry of planet formation in different kinds of disks.</description>

      <title>Confronting compositional confusion through the characterisation of the sub-Neptune orbiting HD 77946</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the detailed characterization of the HD 77946 planetary system. HD 77946 is an F5 ($M_*$ = 1.17 M$_{\odot}$, $R_*$ = 1.31 R$_{\odot}$) star, which hosts a transiting planet recently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), classified as TOI-1778 b. Using TESS photometry, high-resolution spectroscopic data from HARPS-N, and photometry from CHEOPS, we measure the radius and mass from the transit and RV observations, and find that the planet, HD 77946 b, orbits with period $P_{\rm b}$ = $6.527282_{-0.000020}^{+0.000015}$ d, has a mass of $M_{\rm b} = 8.38\pm{1.32}$M$_\oplus$, and a radius of $R_{\rm b} = 2.705_{-0.081}^{+0.086}$R$_\oplus$. From the combination of mass and radius measurements, and the stellar chemical composition, the planet properties suggest that HD 77946 b is a sub-Neptune with a $\sim$1\% H/He atmosphere. However, a degeneracy still exists between water-world and silicate/iron-hydrogen models, and even though interior structure modelling of this planet favours a sub-Neptune with a H/He layer that makes up a significant fraction of its radius, a water-world composition cannot be ruled out, as with $T_{\rm eq} = 1248^{+40}_{-38}~$K, water may be in a supercritical state. The characterisation of HD 77946 b, adding to the small sample of well-characterised sub-Neptunes, is an important step forwards on our journey to understanding planetary formation and evolution pathways. Furthermore, HD 77946 b has one of the highest transmission spectroscopic metrics for small planets orbiting hot stars, thus transmission spectroscopy of this key planet could prove vital for constraining the compositional confusion that currently surrounds small exoplanets.</description>
