      <title>Nonlocal, Pattern-aware Response and Feedback Framework for Regional Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise a pattern-aware feedback framework for representing the forced climate response using a suite of Green's function experiments with solar radiation perturbations. By considering the column energy balance, a comprehensive linear response function (CLRF) forimportant climate variables and feedback quantities such as moist static energy, sea surface temperature, albedo, cloud optical depth, and lapse rate is learned from Green's function data. The learned CLRF delineates the effects of the energy diffusion in both the ocean and atmosphere and the pattern-aware feedbacks from the aforementioned radiatively active processes. The CLRF can then be decomposed into forcing-response mode pairs which are in turn used to construct a reduced-order model (ROM) describing the dominant dynamics of climate responses. These mode pairs capture nonlocal effects and teleconnections in the climate and thus, make the ROM apt for capturing regional features of climate change response. A key observation is that the CLRF captures the polar amplified response as the most excitable mode of the climate system and this mode is explainable in the data-learned pattern-aware feedback framework. The ROM can be used for predicting the response for a given forcing and for reconstructing the forcing from a given response; we demonstrate these capabilities for independent forcing pattern.</description>

      <title>A physics-aware data-driven surrogate approach for fast atmospheric radiative transfer inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) was selected in 2019 as the ninth Earth Explorer mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). Its primary objective is to collect interferometric measurements in the Far-InfraRed (FIR) spectral range, which accounts for 50\% of Earth's outgoing longwave radiation emitted into space, and will be observed from space for the first time. Accurate measurements of the FIR at the top of the atmosphere are crucial for improving climate models. Current instruments are insufficient, necessitating the development of advanced computational techniques. To ensure the quality of the mission data, an End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was developed to simulate the measurement process and evaluate the effects of instrument characteristics and environmental factors. The core challenge of the mission is solving the retrieval problem, which involves estimating atmospheric properties from the radiance spectra observed by the satellite. This problem is ill-posed and regularization techniques are necessary. In this work, we present a novel and fast data-driven approach to approximate the inverse mapping. In the first phase, we generate an initial approximation of the inverse mapping using only simulated FORUM data. In the second phase, we improve this approximation by introducing climatological data as a priori information and using a neural network to estimate the optimal regularization parameters. While our approach does not match the precision of full-physics retrieval methods, its key advantage is the ability to deliver results almost instantaneously, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide more accurate a priori estimates for full-physics methods, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the retrieved atmospheric profiles.</description>

      <title>Bio-optical characterization using Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) on board EOS-06 in coastal region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ocean colour remote sensing, radiance at the sensor level can be modeled using molecular scattering and particle scattering based on existing mathematical models and gaseous absorption in the atmosphere. The modulation of light field by optical constituents within the seawater waters results in the spectral variation of water leaving radiances that can be related to phytoplankton pigment concentration, total suspended matter, vertical diffuse attenuation coefficients etc. Atmospheric correction works very well over open ocean using NIR channels of ocean colour sensors to retrieve geophysical products with reasonable accuracy while it fails over sediment laden and/or optically complex waters. To resolve this issue, a combination of SWIR channels or NIR-SWIR channels are configured in some ocean colour sensors such as Sentinel- OLCI, EOS- 06 OCM etc. Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM)-3 on board EOS -06 was launched on Nov 26, 2022. It has 13 bands in VNIR (400-1010 nm range) with ~1500 km swath for ocean colour monitoring. Arabian Sea near Gujarat coast is chosen as our study site to showcase the geophysical products derived using OCM-3 onboard EOS-06.</description>

      <title>Dataset of polarimetric images of mechanically generated water surface waves coupled with surface elevation records by wave gauges linear array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal measurements of water surface elevation (water waves) in laboratory experiments are essential for scientific and engineering research. Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limited wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges a novel method was developed, using polarization filter equipped camera as the main sensor and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for data processing [1,2]. The developed method training and evaluation was based on in-house made supervised dataset. Here we present this supervised dataset of polarimetric images of the water surface coupled with the water surface elevation measurements made by a linear array of resistance-type wave gauges (WG). The water waves were mechanically generated in a laboratory waves basin, and the polarimetric images were captured under an artificial light source. Meticulous camera and WGs calibration and instruments synchronization supported high spatio-temporal resolution. The data set covers several wavefield conditions, from simple monochromatic wave trains of various steepness, to irregular wavefield of JONSWAP prescribed spectral shape and several wave breaking scenarios. The dataset contains measurements repeated in several camera positions relative to the wave field propagation direction.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Measurement of Polarization and Excitation-Emission Spectrum of Suspended Particles in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of suspended single particles (SSPs) in water is a crucial element for monitoring water ecosystems. Although there are a variety of sensory methods, it is still an unrealized goal to combine multi-wavelength polarized light scattering and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix(EEM) to characterize and classify SSP in water,which can deeply characterize and classify SSPs with different properties. In this paper, we propose an efficient optical method that can simultaneously obtain the SSP's Stokes parameters of four wavelengths and the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) within 125 ns at 120 degree scattering angle in water. We use Mie scattering simulation to validate our method and obtain the optimal parameters for the experiments. We demonstrate the high performance of our method in terms of sensitivity and accuracy through experiments involving microalgae, microplastics and sediments, as well as control experiments under different illumination conditions and classification experiments of harmful microalgae by using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify underwater suspended particles and harmful microalgae based on our method, and show that our method achieves better results than using single-wavelength light. Our method paves the way for the detection of SSPs and polarization research in marine science.</description>

      <title>PACER: Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for climate emulation tasks. Here, we propose PACER, a lightweight 684K parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator. PACER emulates temperature and precipitation stably for 86 years while only being trained on greenhouse gas emissions data. We incorporate a fundamental physical law of advection-diffusion in PACER accounting for boundary conditions and empirically estimating the diffusion co-efficient and flow velocities from emissions data. PACER has been trained on 15 climate models provided by ClimateSet outperforming baselines across most of the climate models and advancing a new state of the art in a climate diagnostic task.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for AI-based Weather Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to the development of several Large Weather Models (LWMs) that rival State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems. Until now, these models have still relied on traditional NWP-generated analysis fields as input and are far from autonomous. Currently, scientists are increasingly focusing on developing data-driven data assimilation (DA) models for LWMs. To expedite advancements in this field and facilitate the operationalization of data-driven end-to-end weather forecasting systems, we propose DABench, a benchmark constructed by simulated observations, real-world observations, and ERA5 reanalysis. DABench contributes four standard features: (1) sparse and noisy observations provided for both simulated and real-world experiments; (2) a Skillful pre-trained Transformer-based weather prediction model, Sformer, designed to generate background fields while rigorously assessing the impact of assimilation outcomes on predictions; (3) standardized evaluation metrics for the model comparison; (4) a strong DA baseline, 4DVarFormerV2. Our experimental results demonstrate that the end-to-end weather forecasting system, integrating 4DVarFormerV2 and Sformer, can assimilate real-world observations, thereby facilitating a stable DA cycle lasting one year and achieving a skillful forecasting lead time of up to 7 days. The proposed DABench will significantly advance research in AI-based DA, AI-based weather forecasting, and related domains.</description>
