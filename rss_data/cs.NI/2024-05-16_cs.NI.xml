      <title>Economics of Integrated Sensing and Communication service provision in 6G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Beyond5G and 6G networks, a common theme is that sensing will play a more significant role than ever before. Over this trend, Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is focused on unifying the sensing functionalities and the communications ones and to pursue direct tradeoffs between them as well as mutual performance gains. We frame the resource tradeoff between the SAC functionalities within an economic setting. We model a service provision by one operator to the users, the utility of which is derived from both SAC functionalities. The tradeoff between the resources that the operator assigns to the SAC functionalities is analyzed from the point of view of the service prices, quantities and profits. We demonstrate that equilibrium quantities and prices exist. And we provide relevant recommendations for enforcing regulatory limits of both power and bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Low-latency Symbol-Synchronous Communication for Multi-hop Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received great interest due to their scalability, energy efficiency, and low-cost deployment. By utilizing multi-hop communication, WSNs can cover a wide area using low transmission power without the need for any communication infrastructure. Traditionally, WSNs rely on store-and-forward routing protocols and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)-based schedules that avoid interference between different wireless nodes. However, emerging challenging scenarios, such as the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and robotic swarms, impose strict latency and reliability requirements, which traditional approaches cannot fulfill. In this paper, we propose a novel symbol-synchronous transmission design that provides reliable low-latency communication with a reasonable data rate on classical sub-6GHz RF frequency bands (e.g., the 2.4GHz ISM band). Instead of avoiding overlapping transmissions, the proposed scheme benefits from concurrent transmissions. Using simulation in MATLAB, we prove that the proposed design allows achieving a wire-like delay of 5ms for a 512-bit packet over multiple hops with only a 0.3% latency increase per extra hop and a low bit error rate (BER) of 0.04%. Compared to similar state-of-the-art approaches it can achieve a significantly higher data rate of 100kbps, which is expected to increase further with future improvements of the system.</description>

      <title>On Sample Selection for Continual Learning: a Video Streaming Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool to model the complexity of communication networks. As networks evolve, we cannot only train once and deploy. Retraining models, known as continual learning, is necessary. Yet, to date, there is no established methodology to answer the key questions: With which samples to retrain? When should we retrain?
  We address these questions with the sample selection system Memento, which maintains a training set with the "most useful" samples to maximize sample space coverage. Memento particularly benefits rare patterns -- the notoriously long "tail" in networking -- and allows assessing rationally when retraining may help, i.e., when the coverage changes.
  We deployed Memento on Puffer, the live-TV streaming project, and achieved a 14% reduction of stall time, 3.5x the improvement of random sample selection. Finally, Memento does not depend on a specific model architecture; it is likely to yield benefits in other ML-based networking applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting 5G Narrowband Jammers with CNN, k-nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G cellular networks are particularly vulnerable against narrowband jammers that target specific control sub-channels in the radio signal. One mitigation approach is to detect such jamming attacks with an online observation system, based on machine learning. We propose to detect jamming at the physical layer with a pre-trained machine learning model that performs binary classification. Based on data from an experimental 5G network, we study the performance of different classification models. A convolutional neural network will be compared to support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, where the last two methods are combined with principal component analysis. The obtained results show substantial differences in terms of classification accuracy and computation time.</description>

      <title>One-Class Classification as GLRT for Jamming Detection in Private 5G Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G mobile networks are vulnerable to jamming attacks that may jeopardize valuable applications such as industry automation. In this paper, we propose to analyze radio signals with a dedicated device to detect jamming attacks. We pursue a learning approach, with the detector being a CNN implementing a GLRT. To this end, the CNN is trained as a two-class classifier using two datasets: one of real legitimate signals and another generated artificially so that the resulting classifier implements the GLRT. The artificial dataset is generated mimicking different types of jamming signals. We evaluate the performance of this detector using experimental data obtained from a private 5G network and several jamming signals, showing the technique's effectiveness in detecting the attacks.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Security Analysis of Real-World Backend Deployments Speaking IoT-Focused Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet-of-Things devices, ranging from smart home assistants to health devices, are pervasive: Forecasts estimate their number to reach 29 billion by 2030. Understanding the security of their machine-to-machine communication is crucial. Prior work focused on identifying devices' vulnerabilities or proposed protocol-specific solutions. Instead, in this paper, we investigate the security of backends speaking Internet-of-Things (IoT) protocols at scale, that is, the backbone of the entire IoT ecosystem.
  We focus on three real-world protocols used by IoT for our large-scale analysis: MQTT, CoAP, and XMPP. We gather a dataset of over 337,000 backends, augment it with geographical and provider data, and perform non-invasive active measurements to investigate three major security threats: information leakage, weak authentication, and denial of service. Our results provide quantitative evidence of a problematic immaturity in the IoT security ecosystem. Among other issues, we find that 9.44% backends expose information, 30.38% CoAP-speaking backends are vulnerable to denial of service attacks, and 99.84% of MQTT-speaking and XMPP-speaking backends use insecure transport protocols (only 0.16% adopt TLS, of which 70.93% adopt a vulnerable version).</description>

      <title>Optimal Switching Networks for Paired-Egress Bell State Analyzer Pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To scale quantum computers to useful levels, we must build networks of quantum computational nodes that can share entanglement for use in distributed forms of quantum algorithms. In one proposed architecture, node-to-node entanglement is created when nodes emit photons entangled with stationary memories, with the photons routed through a switched interconnect to a shared pool of Bell state analyzers (BSAs). Designs that optimize switching circuits will reduce loss and crosstalk, raising entanglement rates and fidelity. We present optimal designs for switched interconnects constrained to planar layouts, appropriate for silicon waveguides and Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) $2 \times 2$ switch points. The architectures for the optimal designs are scalable and algorithmically structured to pair any arbitrary inputs in a rearrangeable, non-blocking way. For pairing $N$ inputs, $N(N - 2)/4$ switches are required, which is less than half of number of switches required for full permutation switching networks. An efficient routing algorithm is also presented for each architecture. These designs can also be employed in reverse for entanglement generation using a shared pool of entangled paired photon sources.</description>

      <title>An Implementation and Analysis of a Practical Quantum Link Architecture Utilizing Entangled Photon Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum repeater networks play a crucial role in distributing entanglement. Various link architectures have been proposed to facilitate the creation of Bell pairs between distant nodes, with entangled photon sources emerging as a primary technology for building quantum networks. Our work advances the Memory-Source-Memory (MSM) link architecture, addressing the absence of practical implementation details. We conduct numerical simulations using the Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP) to analyze the performance of the MSM link and contrast it with other link architectures. We observe a saturation effect in the MSM link, where additional quantum resources do not affect the Bell pair generation rate of the link. By introducing a theoretical model, we explain the origin of this effect and characterize the parameter region where it occurs. Our work bridges theoretical insights with practical implementation, which is crucial for robust and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Performance of Quantum Networks Using Heterogeneous Link Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity of quantum link architectures is an essential theme in designing quantum networks for technological interoperability and possibly performance optimization. However, the performance of heterogeneously connected quantum links has not yet been addressed. Here, we investigate the integration of two inherently different technologies, with one link where the photons flow from the nodes toward a device in the middle of the link, and a different link where pairs of photons flow from a device in the middle towards the nodes. We utilize the quantum internet simulator QuISP to conduct simulations. We first optimize the existing photon pair protocol for a single link by taking the pulse rate into account. Here, we find that increasing the pulse rate can actually decrease the overall performance. Using our optimized links, we demonstrate that heterogeneous networks actually work. Their performance is highly dependent on link configuration, but we observe no significant decrease in generation rate compared to homogeneous networks. This work provides insights into the phenomena we likely will observe when introducing technological heterogeneity into quantum networks, which is crucial for creating a scalable and robust quantum internetwork.</description>

      <title>Engineering Challenges in All-photonic Quantum Repeaters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking, heralded as the next frontier in communication networks, envisions a realm where quantum computers and devices collaborate to unlock capabilities beyond what is possible with the Internet. A critical component for realizing a long-distance quantum network, and ultimately, the Quantum Internet, is the quantum repeater. As with the race to build a scalable quantum computer with different technologies, various schemes exist for building quantum repeaters. This article offers a gentle introduction to the two-way ``all-photonic quantum repeaters,'' a recent addition to quantum repeater technologies. In contrast to conventional approaches, these repeaters eliminate the need for quantum memories, offering the dual benefits of higher repetition rates and intrinsic tolerance to both quantum operational errors and photon losses. Using visualization and simple rules for manipulating graph states, we describe how all-photonic quantum repeaters work. We discuss the problem of the increased volume of classical communication required by this scheme, which places a huge processing requirement on the end nodes. We address this problem by presenting a solution that decreases the amount of classical communication by three orders of magnitude. We conclude by highlighting other key open challenges in translating the theoretical all-photonic framework into real-world implementation, providing insights into the practical considerations and future research directions of all-photonic quantum repeater technology.</description>

      <title>Scalable Timing Coordination of Bell State Analyzers in Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical Bell State Analyzer (BSA) plays a key role in the optical generation of entanglement in quantum networks. The optical BSA is effective in controlling the timing of arriving photons to achieve interference. It is unclear whether timing synchronization is possible even in multi-hop and complex large-scale networks, and if so, how efficient it is. We investigate the scalability of BSA synchronization mechanisms over multiple hops for quantum networks both with and without memory in each node. We first focus on the exchange of entanglement between two network nodes via a BSA, especially effective methods of optical path coordination in achieving the simultaneous arrival of photons at the BSA. In optical memoryless quantum networks, including repeater graph state networks, we see that the quantum optical path coordination works well, though some possible timing coordination mechanisms have effects that cascade to adjacent links and beyond, some of which was not going to work well of timing coordination. We also discuss the effect of quantum memory, given that end-to-end extension of entangled states through multi-node entanglement exchange is essential for the practical application of quantum networks. Finally, cycles of all-optical links in the network topology are shown to may not be to synchronize, this property should be taken into account when considering synchronization in large networks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Deep Transfer Learning Model for Accurate IoT Localization in Diverse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) is an ever-evolving technological paradigm that is reshaping industries and societies globally. Real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making facilitated by localization solutions form the foundation for location-based services, enabling them to support critical functions within diverse IoT ecosystems. However, most existing works on localization focus on single environment, resulting in the development of multiple models to support multiple environments. In the context of smart cities, these raise costs and complexity due to the dynamicity of such environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents a unified indoor-outdoor localization solution that leverages transfer learning (TL) schemes to build a single deep learning model. The model accurately predicts the localization of IoT devices in diverse environments. The performance evaluation shows that by adopting an encoder-based TL scheme, we can improve the baseline model by about 17.18% in indoor environments and 9.79% in outdoor environments.</description>

Abstract: Propagation modeling is a crucial tool for successful wireless deployments and spectrum planning with the demand for high modeling accuracy continuing to grow. Recognizing that detailed knowledge of the physical environment (terrain and clutter) is essential, we propose a novel approach that uses environmental information for predictions. Instead of relying on complex, detail-intensive models, we explore the use of simplified scalar features involving the total obstruction depth along the direct path from transmitter to receiver. Obstacle depth offers a streamlined, yet surprisingly accurate, method for predicting wireless signal propagation, providing a practical solution for efficient and effective wireless network planning.</description>

      <title>Jasper: Scalable and Fair Multicast for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09527v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial exchanges have recently shown an interest in migrating to the public cloud for scalability, elasticity, and cost savings. However, financial exchanges often have strict network requirements that can be difficult to meet on the cloud. Notably, market participants (MPs) trade based on market data about different activities in the market. Exchanges often use switch multicast to disseminate market data to MPs. However, if one MP receives market data earlier than another, that MP would have an unfair advantage. To prevent this, financial exchanges often equalize exchange-to-MP cable lengths to provide near-simultaneous reception of market data at MPs.
  As a cloud tenant, however, building a fair multicast service is challenging because of the lack of switch support for multicast, high latency variance, and the lack of native mechanisms for simultaneous data delivery in the cloud. Jasper introduces a solution that creates an overlay multicast tree within a cloud region that minimizes latency and latency variations through hedging, leverages recent advancements in clock synchronization to achieve simultaneous delivery, and addresses various sources of latency through an optimized DPDK/eBPF implementation -- while scaling to a thousand receivers. Jasper outperforms a prior system, CloudEx, and a commercial multicast solution provided by Amazon Web Services. We present different deployment models and their performance impact. A deployment model where MPs and the exchange do not have to trust each other is realized using confidential computing.</description>

      <title>Slice-aware Resource Allocation and Admission Control for Smart Factory Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) and beyond network offers substantial promise as the ideal wireless technology to replace the existing inflexible wired connections in traditional factories of today. 5G network slicing allows for tailored allocation of resources to different network services, each with unique Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a novel solution for slice-aware radio resource allocation based on a convex optimisation control framework for applications in smart factory wireless networks. The proposed framework dynamically allocates minimum power and sub-channels to downlink mixed service type industrial users categorised into three slices: Capacity Limited (CL), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Time Sensitive (TS) slices. Given that the base station (BS) has limited transmission power, we enforce admission control by effectively relaxing the target rate constraints for current connections in the CL slice. This rate readjustment occurs whenever power consumption exceeds manageable levels. Simulation results show that our approach minimises power, allocates sub-channels to users, maintains slice isolation, and delivers QoS-specific communications to users in all the slices despite time-varying number of users and changing network conditions.</description>
