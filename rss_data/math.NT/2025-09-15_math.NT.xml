      <title>Large values of Dirichlet polynomials with multiplicative coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate large values of Dirichlet polynomials with multiplicative coefficients $\sum_{n\le N}f(n)n^{it}$, where $1\ll t\le T$ for large $T$. We prove an improved Omega result in the region $\exp((\log T)^{\frac12+\varepsilon})\le N\le\sqrt T$, where $T$ is large. We also show an Omega result when $\log N$ is around $\sqrt{\log T\log_2T}$.</description>

      <title>On Dold condition and fail factor of linear recurrent sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence $\mathbf{A}$ is said to be realizable if satisfies so called sign and Dold conditions. We will say that a sequence almost satisfies the Dold condition if there exists a constant $c\in\mathbb{N}_+$ such that $(cA_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_+}$ satisfies the Dold condition. In this paper we give characterisation of sequences defined by linear recursion of any order that almost satisfy the Dold condition. We also give an upper bound on the value of $c$.</description>

      <title>Almost all binary forms of degree $\geq 3$ fail to represent a fixed integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09934v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any fixed integer \( n \geq 3 \) and nonzero integer \( m \), the proportion of integral binary forms of degree \( n \) that represent \( m \) tends to zero as the height tends to infinity. In fact, almost all such forms fail to represent \( m \). Our method uses lattice point counting and geometric methods, including Davenport's lemma and estimates for volumes of hyperplane sections of cubes, together with an analysis of the distribution of rational points on such hyperplanes. The result also holds when restricted to irreducible forms.</description>

      <title>Weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function and their positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the probability that some weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function $f$ are positive. Applying the characteristic decomposition, we obtain that if $S$ is a non-empty subset of the multiplicative residue class group $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ with $m$ being a fixed positive integer and $A=\{a+mn\mid n=0,1,2,3,\cdots\}$ with $a\in S,$ then there exists a positive number $\delta$ independent of $x$, such that \[ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}&lt;0\right)&gt;\delta \] unless the coefficients of the real characters in the expansion of the characteristic function of $S$ according to the characters of $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ are all non-negative, and the coefficients of the complex characters are all zero, in which case we have \[ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}&lt;0\right)=O\left(\exp\left(-\exp\left(\frac{\ln x}{C\ln_{2}x}\right)\right)\right) \] for a positive constant $C.$ This includes as a special case a result of Angelo and Xu. We also extend the result to the cyclotomic field $K_{n}=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n})$ with $\zeta_{n}=e^{2\pi i/n}$ and study the probability that these generalized weighted sums are positive. In addition, we deal with the positivity problem of certain partial sums related to the celebrated Ramanujan tau function $\tau(n)$ and the Ramanujan modular form $\Delta(q),$ and obtain an upper bound for the probability that these partial sums are negative in a more general situation.</description>

      <title>A lower bound for the number of Egyptian fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Egyptian fraction is a sum of the form $1/n_1 + \cdots + 1/n_r$ where $n_1, \dots, n_k$ are distinct positive integers. We prove explicit lower bounds for the cardinality of the set $E_N$ of rational numbers that can be represented by Egyptian fractions with denominators not exceeding $N$. More precisely, we show that for every integer $k \geq 4$ such that $\ln_k N \geq 3/2$ it holds $$ \frac{\ln(|E_N|)}{\ln 2} \geq \Big(2 - \frac{3}{\ln_k N}\Big)\frac{N}{\ln N}\prod_{j=3}^{k} \ln_j N , $$ where $\ln_k$ denotes the $k$-th iterate of the natural logarithm. This improves on a previous result of Bleicher and Erd\H{o}s who established a similar bound but under the more stringent condition $\ln_k N\geq k$ and with a leading constant of $1$. Furthermore, we provide some methods to compute the exact values of $|E_N|$ for large positive integers $N$, and we give a table of $|E_N|$ for $N$ up to $154$.</description>

      <title>The Elementary Type Conjecture for Maximal Pro-p Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Elementary Type Conjecture in Galois theory provides a concrete inductive description of the finitely generated maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups $G_F(p)$ of fields $F$ containing a root of unity of order $p$. We describe several variants of this conjecture, and prove various connections between these variants and other conjectures in field and Galois theory. We focus on a strong arithmetical variant of the conjecture, and its implications to the realization of pro-$p$ Demuskin groups as Galois groups.</description>

      <title>Recurrence relations for harmonic and derangement numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use elementary methods to establish three key recurrence relations: one for derangement numbers, a second for harmonic numbers, and a third for degenerate harmonic numbers. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of the underlying structure of these numbers but also highlight the effectiveness of elementary techniques in discovering new mathematical properties. The findings have potential applications in various fields where these numbers appear, including combinatorics, probability, and computer science.</description>

      <title>Three more proofs of two congruences for Merca's partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we provide three new, very short proofs of two interesting congruences for Merca's partition function $a(n)$, which enumerates integer partitions where the odd parts have multiplicity at most 2. These modulo 2 congruences were first shown elementarily by Sellers. We then frame $a(n)$ into the much broader context of eta-quotients, and suggest how to comprehensively describe its parity behavior. In particular, extensive computations suggest that $a(n)$ is odd precisely 25\% of the time.</description>

      <title>On a Restriction Problem of Hickman and Wright for the Parabola in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ for Squarefree $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hickman and Wright proved an $L^2$ restriction estimate for the parabola $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ of the form
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{6}{5}\right)^\frac{5}{6}$$
  for all functions $f:(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and any $\epsilon&gt;0$, and that this bound is sharp when $N$ has a large square factor, and especially for $N = p^2$ for $p$ a prime. In contrast, Mockenhaupt and Tao proved in the special case $N = p$ the stronger estimate
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4}.$$
  We extend the Mockenhaupt-Tao bound to the case of squarefree $N$, proving
  $$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4},$$
  and discuss applications of this result to uncertainty principles and signal recovery.</description>

      <title>The 3D index and Dehn filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>Log-Hausdorff multifractality of the absolutely continuous spectral measure of the almost Mathieu operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the fractal characteristics of the absolutely continuous spectral measure of the subcritical almost Mathieu operator (AMO) and Diophantine frequency. In particular, we give a complete description of the (classical) multifractal spectrum and a finer description in the logarithmic gauge. The proof combines continued$-$fraction$/$metric Diophantine techniques and refined covering arguments. These results rigorously substantiate (and quantify in a refined gauge) the physicists' intuition that the absolutely continuous component of the spectrum is dominated by energies with trivial scaling index, while also exhibiting nontrivial exceptional sets which are negligible for classical Hausdorff measure but large at the logarithmic scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the following problem. Define a quantum walk on a positively weighted path (linear chain). Can the weights be tuned so that perfect state transfer occurs between the first vertex and any other position? We do not fully answer this question - in fact, we show that a particular case of this problem is equivalent to a solution of a particular case of the well known Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, deeming our original task certainly harder than anticipated. In our journey, we prove new results about sequences of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recurrences. In particular, we provide a full characterization of when two polynomials belong to such a sequence, which (as far as we were able to ascertain) was known only for when their degrees differ by one.</description>

      <title>Some conjectures of Schlosser and Zhou on sign patterns of the coefficients of infinite products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Schlosser and Zhou proposed many conjectures on sign patterns of the coefficients appearing in the $q$-series expansions of the infinite Borwein product and other infinite products raised to a real power. In this paper, we will study several of these conjectures. Let \[ G(q):=\prod_{i=1}^{I}\left(\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}(1-q^{m_{i}+kn_{i}})(1-q^{-m_{i}+(k+1)n_{i}})\right)^{u_{i}} \] where $I$ is a positive integer, $1\leq m_{i}&lt;n_{i}$ and $u_{i}\neq0$ for $1\leq i\leq I$ and $|q|&lt;1.$ We will establish an asymptotic formula for the coefficients of $G(q)^{\delta}$ with $\delta$ being a positive real number by using the Hardy--Ramanujan--Rademacher circle method. As applications, we apply the asymptotic formula to confirm some of the conjectures of Schlosser and Zhou.</description>

      <title>The $(p,t,a)$-inertial groups as finite monodromy groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silverberg and Zarhin introduced the notion of a $(p,t,a)$-inertial group in the hope of having a group theoretic characterization of the finite groups that appear as finite monodromy groups -- the groups that represent the local obstruction to semi-stable reduction -- of abelian varieties in fixed dimension $t+a$. In this text, we provide a positive answer to their question, that is, every $(p,t,a)$-inertial group is the finite monodromy group of an abelian variety in dimension $t+a$. To prove this, we show a structure theorem on the rational group algebra $\mathbf{Q}[G]$ of ramification groups, refining a theorem of Serre and generalizing results on $p$-groups of Roquette and Ford.</description>

      <title>Primes in Arithmetic Progressions to Large Moduli and Siegel Zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10780v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $D$ with $L(s,\chi)$ its associated $L$-function, and let $\psi(x,q,a)$ be Chebyshev's prime-counting function for primes congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q&lt;x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q&lt;x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q&lt;x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Cohen-Style Threefield Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1988, Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed that a $q$-series $\sigma$ found in Ramanujan's lost notebook and related to partitions could be interpreted as counting ideals in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$, and found similar formulas for $\sigma$ in terms of ideals of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. Cohen followed this by showing more generally that for certain triples of quadratic fields, there is abelian extension and conductor so that the ray class character theta series for all three fields coincide. In the intervening years, several $q$-series counting ideals in quadratic fields have been explored, nearly all relating to the fields explored by Andrews et al. In this paper we give an example of a ray class character theta series which stems from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$. We use recent work of Okano to give explicit formulas via quadratic form theta series with congruence conditions stemming from each field. We isolate an analogue of $\sigma$ for this series and show that it has coefficients also given by a partition generating function.</description>

      <title>Comparing Left and Right Quotient Sets in Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite subset $A$ of a group $G$, we define the right quotient set and the left quotient set of $A$, respectively, as $AA^{-1} := \{a_1a_2^{-1}:a_1,a_2\in A\}$, $A^{-1}A := \{a_1^{-1}a_2:a_1,a_2\in A\}$. While the right and left quotient sets are equal if $G$ is abelian, subtleties arise when $G$ is a nonabelian group, where the cardinality difference $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$ may be take on arbitrarily large values. Using the results of Martin and O'Bryant on the cardinality differences of sum sets and difference sets in $\mathbb{Z}$, we prove in the infinite dihedral group, $D_\infty \cong \mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, every integer difference is achievable. Further, we prove that in $F_2$, the free group on $2$ generators, an integer difference is achievable if and only if that integer is even, and we explicitly construct subsets of $F_2$ that achieve every even integer. We further determine the minimum cardinality of $A \subset G$ so that the difference between the cardinalities of the left and right quotient sets is nonzero, depending on the existence of order $2$ elements in $G$. To prove these results, we construct difference graphs $D_A$ and $D_{A^{-1}}$ which encode equality, respectively, in the right and left quotient sets. We observe a bijection from edges in $D_A$ to edges in $D_{A^{-1}}$ and count connected components in order to obtain our results on cardinality differences $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic Higher Green's Functions for Stark-Heegner Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heegner cycles are higher weight analogues of Heegner points. Their arithmetic intersection numbers also appear as Fourier coefficients of modular forms and often belong to abelian extensions of imaginary-quadratic fields. Rotger and Seveso propose a precise recipe for the $p$-adic Abel-Jacobi images of cycle classes whose existence is predicted by conjectures of Bloch and Beilinson and which would be a real-quadratic analogue to Heegner cycles: the Stark-Heegner cycles of the title.
  In this paper, we generalize Darmon-Vonk's theory of rigid meromorphic cocycles to higher weight, producing a higher Green's pairing of real-quadratic divisors on the $p$-adic upper half-plane, which seems to be the real-quadratic analogue of the pairing of Heegner cycles. Computation of these values for "principal cycles'' gives evidence that they lie in abelian extensions of real-quadratic fields. The algebraicity of certain values of the higher Green's function is indirect evidence for the existence of algebraic Stark-Heegner cycles.</description>

      <title>Frobenius height of prismatic cohomology with coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of Frobenius operators on smooth proper pushforwards of prismatic F-crystals. In particular we show that the i-th pushforward has its Frobenius height increased by at most i. Our proof crucially uses the notion of prismatic F-gauges introduced by Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie and its relative version, and we give a self-contained treatment without using the stacky formulation.</description>
