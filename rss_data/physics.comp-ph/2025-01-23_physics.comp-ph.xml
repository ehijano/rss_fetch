      <title>Recognizing and generating knotted molecular structures by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knotted molecules occur naturally and are designed by scientists to gain special biological and material properties. Understanding and utilizing knotting require efficient methods to recognize and generate knotted structures, which are unsolved problems in mathematics and physics. Here, we solve these two problems using machine learning. First, our Transformer-based neural network (NN) can recognize the knot types of given chain conformations with an accuracy of $&gt;99\%$. We can use a single NN model to recognize knots with different chain lengths, and our computational speed is about 4500 times faster than the most popular mathematical method for knot recognition: the Alexander polynomials. Second, we for the first time design a diffusion-based NN model to generate conformations for given knot types. The generated conformations satisfy not only the desired knot types, but also the correct physical distributions of the radii of gyration and knot sizes. The results have several implications. First, the Transformer is suitable for handling knotting tasks, probably because of its strength in processing sequence information, a key component in knotting. Second, our NN can replace mathematical methods of knot recognition for faster speed on many occasions. Third, our models can facilitate the design of knotted protein structures. Lastly, analyzing how NN recognizes knot types can provide insight into the principle behind knots, an unsolved problem in mathematics. We provide an online website (http://144.214.24.236) for using our models.</description>

      <title>Is fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo reproducible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to address the titular question, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. This work lays the foundation to establish accurate and reproducible FN-DMC estimates for all future studies across applications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.</description>

      <title>Optimization of passive superconductors for shaping stellarator magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the novel problem of optimizing a large set of passive superconducting coils (PSCs) with currents induced by a background magnetic field rather than power supplies. In the nuclear fusion literature, such coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators and provide passive stabilization. We perform the first optimizations of PSC arrays with respect to the orientation, shape, and location of each coil, jointly minimized with the background fields. We conclude by generating passive coil array solutions for four stellarators.</description>

      <title>The Marginal Importance of Distortions and Alignment in CASSI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable ray-tracing based model that incorporates aberrations and distortions to render realistic coded hyperspectral acquisitions using Coded-Aperture Spectral Snapshot Imagers (CASSI). CASSI systems can now be optimized in order to fulfill simultaneously several optical design constraints as well as processing constraints. Four comparable CASSI systems with varying degree of optical aberrations have been designed and modeled. The resulting rendered hyperspectral acquisitions from each of these systems are combined with five state-of-the-art hyperspectral cube reconstruction processes. These reconstruction processes encompass a mapping function created from each system's propagation model to account for distortions and aberrations during the reconstruction process. Our analyses show that if properly modeled, the effects of geometric distortions of the system and misalignments of the dispersive elements have a marginal impact on the overall quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes. Therefore, relaxing traditional constraints on measurement conformity and fidelity to the scene enables the development of novel imaging instruments, guided by performance metrics applied to the design or the processing of acquisitions. By providing a complete framework for design, simulation and evaluation, this work contributes to the optimization and exploration of new CASSI systems, and more generally to the computational imaging community.</description>

      <title>Open questions on defining and computing the vapour-liquid surface tension by virial and test transformation approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses four problems in defining and computing the surface tension of vapour-liquid interfaces: (1) The apparent kinetic contribution to the surface tension, and what it is that makes it appear; (2) the problem of defining the local virial, which for some purposes appears to be necessary; (3) the disagreement between results for spherical interfaces when using different methods, specifically the virial and the test area method; (4) how the surface tension values obtained from these methods can be related to the definition of the surface tension from thermodynamics - since if they cannot, it is a meaningless exercise to compute them. At the end, all these problems remain unsolved: They are "open questions."</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Chiral Structures for Giant Helical Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating chiral light-matter interactions is essential for advancing applications in sensing, imaging, and pharmaceutical development. However, the chiroptical response in natural chiral molecules and subwavelength chiral structures is inherently weak, with the characterization tool limited to optical methods that utilize the light with spin angular momentum (SAM). To overcome this, orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams, characterized by helical wavefronts, have emerged as a compelling research focus. Helical dichroism (HD) describes the differential absorbance of OAM beams with opposite signs of topological charges. By using inverse design with adjoint methods for topology optimization, we design the chiral structure optimized to increase HD response under OAM beam incidence, demonstrating a giant HD response of ~107% with topological charges $|\pm\ell|$ = 3 at the wavelength of 800 nm. This study reveals distinct helicity-dependent interactions between the structure and OAM beams, highlighting the potential for custom-tuned chiroptical responses.</description>

      <title>A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.</description>

      <title>Sunny.jl: A Julia Package for Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.</description>

      <title>Influence of initial conditions on data-driven model identification and information entropy for ideal mhd problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods of model identification are able to discern governing dynamics of a system from data. Such methods are well suited to help us learn about systems with unpredictable evolution or systems with ambiguous governing dynamics given our current understanding. Many plasma problems of interest fall into these categories as there are a wide range of models that exist, however each model is only useful in a certain regime and often limited by computational complexity. To ensure data-driven methods align with theory, they must be consistent and predictable when acting on data whose governing dynamics are known. Weak Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) is a recently developed data-driven method that has shown promise in learning governing dynamics from data with high noise levels [1]. This work examines how WSINDy acts on ideal MHD test problems as the initial conditions are varied and specifies limiting requirements for successful equation identification. It is hard to recover the governing dynamics from data that emphasize a single dominant behavior. In these low information cases, Shannon information entropy is able to pick up on the redundancies in the data that affect recoverability.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-size particles in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluid-solid interaction of suspensions of Kolmogorov-size spherical particles moving in homogeneous isotropic turbulence at a microscale Reynolds number of $Re_\lambda \approx 140$. Two volume fractions are considered, $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, and the solid-to-fluid density ratio is set to $5$ and $100$. We present a comparison between interface-resolved (PR-DNS) and one-way-coupled point-particle (PP-DNS) direct numerical simulations. We find that the modulated energy spectrum shows the classical $-5/3$ Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial range of scales and a $-4$ scaling at smaller scales, with the latter resulting from a balance between the energy injected by the particles and the viscous dissipation, in an otherwise smooth flow. An analysis of the small-scale flow topology shows that the particles mainly favour events with axial strain and vortex compression. The dynamics of the particles and their collective motion studied for PR-DNS are used to assess the validity of the PP-DNS. We find that the PP-DNS predicts fairly well both the Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics of the particles motion for the low-density case, while some discrepancies are observed for the high-density case. Also, the PP-DNS is found to underpredict the level of clustering of the suspension compared to the PR-DNS, with a larger difference for the high-density case.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>
