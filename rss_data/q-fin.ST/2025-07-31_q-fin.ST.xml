      <title>Quantum generative modeling for financial time series with temporal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.</description>

      <title>Order Book Filtration and Directional Signal Extraction at High Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of electronic capital markets and algorithmic trading agents, the number of events in tick-by-tick market data has exploded. A large fraction of these orders is transient. Their ephemeral character degrades the informativeness of directional alphas derived from the limit order book (LOB) state. We investigate whether directional signals such as order book imbalance (OBI) can be improved by structurally filtering high-frequency LOB data. Three real-time, observable filtration schemes: based on order lifetime, update count, and inter-update delay. These are used to recompute OBI on structurally filtered event streams. To assess the effect of filtration, we implement a three-layer diagnostic framework: contemporaneous correlation with returns, explanatory power under discretized regime counts, and causal coherence via Hawkes excitation norms. Empirical results show that structural filtration improves directional signal clarity in correlation and regime-based metrics, but leads to only limited gains in causal excitation strength. In contrast, OBI computed using trade events exhibits stronger causal alignment with future price movements. These findings highlight the importance of differentiating between associative and causal diagnostics when designing high-frequency directional signals.</description>

      <title>Year-over-Year Developments in Financial Fraud Detection via Deep Learning: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically reviews advancements in deep learning (DL) techniques for financial fraud detection, a critical issue in the financial sector. Using the Kitchenham systematic literature review approach, 57 studies published between 2019 and 2024 were analyzed. The review highlights the effectiveness of various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, and transformers across domains such as credit card transactions, insurance claims, and financial statement audits. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were evaluated. Key themes explored include the impact of data privacy frameworks and advancements in feature engineering and data preprocessing. The study emphasizes challenges such as imbalanced datasets, model interpretability, and ethical considerations, alongside opportunities for automation and privacy-preserving techniques such as blockchain integration and Principal Component Analysis. By examining trends over the past five years, this review identifies critical gaps and promising directions for advancing DL applications in financial fraud detection, offering actionable insights for researchers and practitioners.</description>
