      <title>An affirmative answer to a question on connectivity of p-subgroup posets with irreducible characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, $e$ a nonnegative integer, and G a finite p-group with $p^{e+1}$ dividing $|G|$. Let I be the intersection of all subgroups of order $p^{e+1}$ in $G$. It is proved that $|I\cap Z(G)|\le |\pi_0(\Gamma_{p,e}(G))|\le {\rm Irr}(I)$, where $\Gamma_{p,e}(G)$, whose connected components is denoted by $\pi_0(\Gamma_{p,e}(G))$, is the poset consisting of all pairs $(H, \varphi)$ with $H \le G$, $|H|\ge p^{e+1}$, and $\varphi\in {\rm Irr}(H)$. Hence, an affirmative answer to Question 2 raised by Meng and Yang is obtained.</description>

      <title>Branch iterated Galois group with positive fixed-point proportion and positive Hausdroff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the arithmetic profinite iterated monodromy group of a post-critically infinite unicritical polynomial is regular branch (and so of positive Hausdorff dimension), and has positive fixed-point proportion when the degree is odd. The examples are instances of a bigger family of regular branch groups constructed in this article, whose fixed-point proportion can be computed explicitly and is positive in many cases. This gives the first examples outside the binary rooted tree where a level-transitive group has positive Hausdorff dimension and positive fixed-point proportion, answering in the negative a question of Jones (2008).</description>

      <title>Expanding groups with large diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the spectral gap and diameter of Cayley graphs depend strongly on the choice of generating set.
  We answer a question of Pyber and Szab\'o (2013)
  by exhibiting a sequence of finite groups $G_n$ with $|G_n| \to \infty$ admitting bounded generating sets $X_n,Y_n$ such that $\operatorname{Cay}(G_n,X_n)$ is an expander
  while $\operatorname{Cay}(G_n,Y_n)$ has super-polylogarithmic diameter.
  The construction uses the semidirect product $G_n = C_p^{n-1} \rtimes S_n$ with $p$ exponentially large in $n$,
  and the analysis reduces to bounding some exponential sums of permutational type.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension of Difference Graph of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Difference graph $\mathcal{D}(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the difference of the enhanced power graph $\mathcal{P}_{E}(G)$ and the power graph $\mathcal{P}(G)$ with all the isolated vertices removed. In this paper, we characterize the vertex set of the difference graph of finite nilpotent groups and obtain its cardinality. Consequently, we obtain the metric dimension of the difference graph of finite nilpotent groups. Moreover, this paper determines the metric dimension of the difference graphs of certain non-nilpotent groups, namely: dihedral groups, the generalized quaternion groups, and the semi-dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Classification of abelian Schur groups I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite group $G$ is called a Schur group if every $S$-ring over $G$ is schurian, i.e. associated in a natural way with a subgroup of $Sym(G)$ that contains all right translations of $G$. The list of all possible abelian Schur groups was obtained by Evdokimov, Kov\'acs, and Ponomarenko in 2016. In two papers, we finish a classification of abelian Schur groups. In the present paper, we study schurity of several groups from the list. Namely, we prove that a direct product of the elementary abelian group of order 4 and a cyclic group, whose order is an odd prime power or a product of two distinct odd primes, is a Schur group and establish nonschurity of some other groups from the list.</description>

      <title>Galois action on the principal block and generation of Sylow 3-subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove one direction of a conjecture of Navarro-Rizo-Schaeffer Fry-Vallejo positing an algorithm to determine from the character table whether a finite group has $2$-generated Sylow $3$-subgroups. This gives further evidence of the blockwise version of the Galois-McKay conjecture (also known as the Alperin-McKay-Navarro conjecture). A key step involves proving the Isaacs-Navarro Galois conjecture for principal blocks for finite groups with a certain structure.</description>

      <title>Common overlattices in trees and trees with fins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bass and Kulkarni proved that any pair of free uniform lattices in the automorphism group of a tree have conjugates that both lie inside a third uniform lattice (which is not necessarily free). We show that this does not generalise to trees with fins. The construction of our counter-example involves working with a certain generalisation of the universal groups of Burger and Mozes.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic tensor products and a Ganea-type extension of the five-term exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03951v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a symmetric bilinear, actually bi-right exact and for varieties even bi-cocontinuous product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain 2-nilpotent symmetric operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.
  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.</description>

      <title>Unitary Invariants of the Finite Heisenberg Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial invariants of a group action often appear only in high degree, and in many representations the invariant ring imposes severe degree constraints before any nontrivial invariants can occur. In contrast, the larger class of unitary invariants -- polynomials in both the variables and their conjugates -- typically exhibits very different behavior, and their separating power is comparatively unexplored.
  We highlight this contrast in the setting of the finite Heisenberg group $H_N$. Although the polynomial invariant ring $\mathbb{C}[V]^{H_N}$ contains no nontrivial elements below degree $N$, we show that degree-six unitary invariants are already sufficient to separate generic $H_N$-orbits up to a global phase factor. These invariants arise from cubic equations involving the magnitudes of a vector and its discrete Fourier transform. A single polynomial invariant in degree $N$ then resolves the remaining global phase, yielding full generic orbit separation. Our proof utilizes fundamental results from phase retrieval. Along the way we will also explore the utility of unitary invariants in obtaining improved degree bounds for representations of cyclic groups.
  This paper provides a concrete example in which the minimal separating degree for unitary invariants is dramatically lower than the minimal degree for polynomial invariants.</description>

      <title>A group structure arising from Grover walks on complete graphs with self-loops and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a group-theoretic framework to analyze the algebraic structure of the Grover walk on a complete graph with self-loops. We construct a group generated by the Grover matrix and a diagonal matrix whose entries are powers of a complex root of unity. We then characterize the resulting quotient group, which is defined using a subgroup formed by commutators involving these matrices. We show that this quotient group is isomorphic to a finite cyclic group whose structure depends on the parity of the number of vertices. This group-theoretic characterization reveals underlying symmetries in the time evolution of the Grover walk and provides an algebraic framework for understanding its periodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Similarity Algebra: A Framework for Approximate Algebraic and Lie Structures with Collapse to Classical Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical algebraic structures require exact satisfaction of their defining axioms. We propose similarity algebra, a framework extending algebraic and Lie structures to settings where operations satisfy quantitative bounds up to a tolerance $\varepsilon$. Instead of strict associativity, inverses, or distributivity, we study families of operations controlled by explicit $\varepsilon$-estimates and analyze their behavior under limit collapse.
  Under uniform error control and $C^1_{\mathrm{loc}}$ convergence of the structure maps, we prove a general collapse theorem showing that similarity structures converge to classical algebraic objects, as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. We develop a hierarchy of approximate structures, including similarity groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and Lie groups, formalized through axioms satisfied within metric distance $\varepsilon$. We further define a category of similarity algebras governing morphisms between approximate systems. Moreover, we clarify the relationship between similarity algebra and fuzzy algebra, showing that the former generalizes the latter. The proposed similarity algebra can be useful to model real-world phenomena where operations or relations are inherently approximate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we study a natural analytic property of inclusions of groups akin to co-amenability: the property of existence of a non-compactly supported invariant state for the conjugation action of a group $G$ on the von Neumann algebra generated by the characteristic functions $\{\mathbf{1}_{gHg^{-1}}\}_{g\in G}$ viewed inside $\ell^\infty(G)$. Some interesting settings and examples of this phenomena are proved. We also comment on a consideration related to proper proximality, which motivated this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that a recent condition of Lyons--Mart\'inez--Navarro--Tiep, regarding the field of values of extensions of characters in principal blocks, is satisfied for all finite simple groups, which when combined with their results gives a new characterization of finite groups with a normal $\ell$-complement for a prime $\ell$. This leads us to study the distribution of characters in unipotent blocks of disconnected reductive groups and show that this is well-behaved under a generalization of $d$-Harish-Chandra theory. We go on to study the blockwise Galois--McKay (also known as the Alperin--McKay--Navarro) conjecture for the blocks of almost (quasi-)simple groups above unipotent blocks.</description>

      <title>Rook placements and coadjoint orbits for maximal unipotent subgroups of finite symplectic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup in a symplectic group over a finite field of sufficiently large characteristic $p$. According to the Kirillov's orbit method, the coadjoint orbits of the group $U$ play the key role in the description of irreducible complex characters of $U$. Almost all important classes of orbits and characters studied to the moment can be uniformly described as the orbits and characters associated with so-called orthogonal rook placements. In the paper, we construct a semi-direct decomposition for the corresponding irreducible characters in the spirit of the Mackey little group method. As a corollary, we present an explicit formula for the character corresponding to an orbit of maximal possible dimension.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion Models with Symmetries through Canonicalization with Applications to Molecular Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce rotation groups as a common generalisation of Coxeter groups and graph products of groups (including right-angled Artin groups). We characterise algebraically these groups by presentations (periagroups) and we propose a combinatorial geometry (mediangle graphs) to study them. As an application, we give natural and unified proofs for several results that hold for both Coxeter groups and graph products of groups.</description>

      <title>Fuchs' problem for linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Which groups can occur as the group of units in a ring? Such groups are called realizable. Though the realizable members of several classes of groups have been determined (e.g., cyclic, odd order, alternating, symmetric, finite simple, indecomposable abelian, and dihedral), the question remains open. The general linear groups are realizable by definition: they are the units in the corresponding matrix rings. In this paper, we study the realizability of two closely related linear groups, the special linear groups and the affine general linear groups. We determine which special linear groups of degree 2 over a finite field are realizable by a finite ring, and we determine which affine general linear groups of degree 1 over a cyclic group are realizable by a finite ring. We also give partial results for certain linear groups of other degrees and for rings of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Bilipschitz Equivalence and the Quasiisometric Classification of Solvable Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a product theorem for sublinear bilipschitz equivalences which generalizes the classical work of Kapovich, Kleiner and Leeb on quasiisometries between product spaces. We employ our product theorem to distinguish up to quasiisometry certain families of solvable groups which share the same dimension, cone-dimension and Dehn function; actually we do this by distinguishing them up to sublinear bilipschitz equivalence, which is slightly stronger. As an application, we recover the fact, recently obtained by Bourdon and R\'emy with different groups, that there exists uncountably many quasiisometry classes of indecomposable, non-unimodular, high rank solvable Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Finite groups in which every proper characteristic subgroup is cyclic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite non-cyclic, non-characteristically simple group with the property that all proper characteristic subgroups of $G$ are cyclic. We call such a group $\mathrm{CCS}$ group, short for \emph{Characteristic Cyclic}. In this paper, we provide a complete classification of these groups. As an application of our main result, we also make some progress toward the classification of minimal non-cyclic skew braces.</description>

      <title>Groups and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are intereseted in quandles and their enveloping groups. Various results are proven. We show that a quandle $Q$ and its image in the enveloping group $G(Q)$ have isomorphic enveloping groups. The image quandle is injective. For $Q$ a finite quandle, we show that $G(Q)$ admits a faithfull representation $\rho : G(Q)\to GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for some $n$; an irreducible representation of $G(Q)$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is finite dimensional an its degree divides the order of the group $Inn(Q)$ of inner automorphism of $Q$ and is bounded by $\sqrt{\vert Inn(Q) \vert }$. We determine the Malcev Lie algebra and the rational cohomology ring of $G(Q)$ for $Q$ finite. We prove that a finite injective quandle is a subquandle (for conjugacy) of a finite group. We also prove that the only finite subquandles (for conjugacy) of uniquely divisible groups are trivial quandles and that morphisms from quandles to nilpotent groups (for conjugacy) are constant on the indecomposable components. Implication of these results are considered.</description>

      <title>Bases of Permutation Groups and Boolean Representable Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A base of a permutation group (X,G) is a subset B of X such that its pointwise stabilizer is the trivial group. A list (x1,x2, ... ,xk) of elements of X is irredundant if each element is not in the pointwise stabilizer of its predecessors. We define a Boolean representable simplicial complex B(X,G) such that a subset Y of X is independent if and only if some enumeration of its elements is irredundant. In addition Y is a base if and only if its closure is X. We give a number of examples and close with a conjecture whose solution leads to a new proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's Theorem 90, periodicity, and roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a cyclic field extension of degree $n$, and let $\sigma$ generate the group ${\rm Gal}(E/F)$. If ${\rm Tr}^E_F(y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma^i y=0$, then the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=\sigma x-x$ for some $x\in E$. When $E$ has characteristic $p&gt;0$ we prove that $x$ gives rise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where $n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. We also show, if $y$ lies in the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, then the roots of a reducible Artin-Schreier polynomial $t^p-t-y$ have the form $x+u$ where $u\in\mathbb{F}_p$ and $x=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\in\mathbb{F}_{p^e}$ with $e=n_p$. Furthermore, the sequence $\left(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}\right)_{i\ge0}$ is periodic with period $pe$.</description>

      <title>Real 3-qubit gate decompositions via triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any unimodular real 3-qubit gate can be expressed as the product of at most 14 CNOT gates plus single-qubit gates, improving on the bound of 16 CNOTs due to Wei and Di. Our method uses the exotic triality symmetry of $\operatorname{PSO}(8)$, and we explore some of the useful properties of this map in relation to the study of real 3-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</description>
