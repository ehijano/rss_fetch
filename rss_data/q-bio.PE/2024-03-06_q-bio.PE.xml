      <title>Possible and Impossible Inferences From Reconstructed Evolutionary Processes using Phylogenies as an Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of past evolutionary change is often based on reconstructions based on incomplete data, raising fundamental questions about the degree to which we can make reliable inferences about past evolutionary processes. This was demonstrated by Louca and Pennell (2020), who showed that each pure-birth process can be generated by an infinite number of birth-death processes. Here, I explore what it means to reconstruct past evolutionary change with three approaches from measure theory, group theory, and homotopy theory to better understand structural constraint and origins of (non)identifiability. As an example, the developed framework is applied to the case of birth-death processes.</description>

      <title>Informational Rescaling of PCA Maps with Application to Genetic Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the inadequacy of covariances/correlations and other measures in L2 as relative distance metrics under some conditions. We propose a computationally simple heuristic to transform a map based on standard principal component analysis (PCA) (when the variables are asymptotically Gaussian) into an entropy-based map where distances are based on mutual information (MI). Rescaling Principal Component based distances using MI allows a representation of relative statistical associations when, as in genetics, it is applied on bit measurements between individuals' genomic mutual information.
  This entropy rescaled PCA, while preserving order relationships (along a dimension), changes the relative distances to make them linear to information. We show the effect on the entire world population and some subsamples, which leads to significant differences with the results of current research.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion models of biological invasion: Open source computational tools, key concepts and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides open-access computational tools that support a range of mathematical approaches to analyse three related scalar reaction-diffusion models used to study biological invasion. Starting with the classic Fisher-Kolmogorov (Fisher-KPP) model, we illustrate how computational methods can be used to explore time-dependent partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in parallel with phase plane and regular perturbation techniques to explore invading travelling wave solutions moving with dimensionless speed $c \ge 2$. To overcome the lack of a well-defined sharp front in solutions of the Fisher-KPP model, we also review two alternative modeling approaches. The first is the Porous-Fisher model where the linear diffusion term is replaced with a degenerate nonlinear diffusion term. Using phase plane and regular perturbation methods, we explore the distinction between sharp- and smooth-fronted invading travelling waves that move with dimensionless speed $c \ge 1/\sqrt{2}$. The second alternative approach is to reformulate the Fisher-KPP model as a moving boundary problem on $0 &lt; x &lt; L(t)$, leading to the Fisher-Stefan model with sharp-fronted travelling wave solutions arising from a PDE model with a linear diffusion term. Time-dependent PDE solutions and phase plane methods show that travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-Stefan model can describe both biological invasion $(c &gt; 0)$ and biological recession $(c &lt; 0)$. Open source Julia code to replicate all computational results in this review is available on GitHub; we encourage researchers to use this code directly or to adapt the code as required for more complicated models.</description>
