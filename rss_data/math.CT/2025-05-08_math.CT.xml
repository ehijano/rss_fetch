      <title>Categorical and geometric methods in statistical, manifold, and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss applications of the category of probabilistic morphisms, initially developed in \cite{Le2023}, as well as some geometric methods to several classes of problems in statistical, machine and manifold learning which shall be, along with many other topics, considered in depth in the forthcoming book \cite{LMPT2024}.</description>

      <title>Toward Riemannian diffeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Riemannian diffeology. To this end, we use the tangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on a diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. With a technical condition for a definite Riemannian metric, we show that the psudodistance induced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of Riemannian diffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps and the mixed one are considered.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck's theory of fibred categories for monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grothendieck's theory of fibred categories establishes an equivalence between fibred categories and pseudo functors. It plays a major role in algebraic geometry and categorical logic. This paper aims to show that fibrations are also very important in monoid theory. Among other things, we generalise Grothendieck's result slightly and show that there exists an equivalence between prefibrations (also known as Schreier extension in the monoidal world) and lax functors. We also construct two exact sequences which involve various automorphism groups arising from a given fibration. This exact sequence was previously only known for group extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Groupoid cardinality is an invariant of locally finite groupoids which has many of the properties of the cardinality of finite sets, but which takes values in all non-negative real numbers, and accounts for the morphisms of a groupoid. Several results on groupoid cardinality are proved, analogous to the relationship between cardinality of finite sets and i.e. injective or surjective functions. We also generalize to a broad class of (2,1)-categories a famous theorem of Lov\'asz which characterizes the isomorphism type of relational structures by counting the number of homomorphisms into them.</description>

      <title>Functor calculus via non-cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study versions of Goodwillie's calculus of functors for indexing diagrams other than cubes. We in particular construct universal excisive approximations for a larger class of diagrams, which yields an extension of the Taylor tower. We prove that the limit of this extension agrees with the limit of the Taylor tower using criteria for the existence of maps between excisive approximations. Lastly we investigate in which cases our new notions of excision coincide with classical ones.</description>

      <title>Absolute algebras, contramodules, and duality squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absolute algebras are a new type of algebraic structures, endowed with a meaningful notion of infinite sums of operations without supposing any underlying topology. Opposite to the usual definition of operadic calculus, they are defined as algebras over cooperads. The goal of this article is to develop this new theory. First, we relate the homotopy theory of absolute algebras to the homotopy theory of usual algebras via a duality square. It intertwines bar-cobar adjunctions with linear duality adjunctions. In particular, we show that linear duality functors between types of coalgebras and types of algebras are Quillen functors and that they induce equivalences between objects with finiteness conditions on their homology. We give general comparison results between absolute types of algebras and their classical counterparts. We work out examples of this theory such as absolute associative algebras and absolute Lie algebras, and show that it includes the theory of contramodules. Campos--Petersen--Robert-Nicoud--Wierstra showed that two nilpotent Lie algebras whose universal enveloping algebras are isomorphic as associative algebras must be isomorphic. As an application of our results, we generalize their theorem to the setting of absolute Lie algebras and absolute $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-algebras.</description>
