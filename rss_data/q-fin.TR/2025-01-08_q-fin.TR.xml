      <title>Market Making with Fads, Informed, and Uninformed Traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the solutions to a continuous-time optimal liquidity provision problem in a market populated by informed and uninformed traders. In our model, the asset price exhibits fads -- these are short-term deviations from the fundamental value of the asset. Conditional on the value of the fad, we model how informed traders and uninformed traders arrive in the market. The market maker knows of the two groups of traders but only observes the anonymous order arrivals. We study both, the complete information and the partial information versions of the control problem faced by the market maker. In such frameworks, we characterise the value of information, and we find the price of liquidity as a function of the proportion of informed traders in the market. Lastly, for the partial information setup, we explore how to go beyond the Kalman-Bucy filter to extract information about the fad from the market arrivals.</description>

      <title>Improving Capital Efficiency and Impermanent Loss: Multi-Token Proactive Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current approaches to the cryptocurrency automated market makers result in poor impermanent loss and capital efficiency. We analyze the mechanics underlying DODO Exchange's proactive market maker (PMM) to probe for solutions to these issues, leading to our key insight of multi-token trading pools. We explore this paradigm primarily through the construction of a generalization of PMM, the multi-token token proactive market maker (MPMM). We show via simulations that MPMM has better impermanent loss and capital efficiency than comparable market makers under a variety of market scenarios. We also test multi-token generalizations of other common 2-token pool market makers. Overall, this work demonstrates several advantages of multi-token pools and introduces a novel multi-token pool market maker.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Automated Crypto Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency investment is inherently difficult due to its shorter history compared to traditional assets, the need to integrate vast amounts of data from various modalities, and the requirement for complex reasoning. While deep learning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their black-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due to their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable decisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive tasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in their training corpora.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses specialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks such as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making for the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training module fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional investment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs real-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique intrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by adjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and facilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data from November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework outperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset pricing, portfolio, and explainability performance.</description>
