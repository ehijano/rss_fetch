      <title>Spectral coverings without embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a weakened version of the spectral correspondence for twisted Higgs bundles. Namely, we construct twisted Higgs bundles from a finite covering map and a vector bundle on that covering but without requiring that they match the eigen-data for some fixed twisted Higgs bundle. We investigate stability for twisted Higgs bundles constructed in this way, and compare our covering data to that of the traditional spectral cover.</description>

      <title>Birational equivalence of exponential matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$ and let $\mathbb{G}_a$ denote the additive group of $k$. We give one-to-one correspondences between exponentional matrices and various objects, and in particular give a one-to-one correspondence between exponential matrices of size $n$-by-$n$ and $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions on the $(n - 1)$-dimensional projective space. We then introduce birational equivalence of exponential matrices and start to classify exponential matrices birationally. In characteristic zero, we give a birational classification of exponential matrices of size $n$-by-$n$ $(n \geq 2)$, which consists of two types. And in positive characteristic, we give birational classifications of exponential matrices of sizes two-by-two and three-by-three.</description>

Abstract: Let $H$ be a subgroup of ${\rm PGL}(2,\mathbb C)$ (respectively, ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb C)$) such that the Zariski closure in ${\rm PGL}(2,\mathbb C)$ (respectively, ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb C)$) of some compact subgroup of $H$ contains $H$. We classify the $H$--equivariant holomorphic vector bundles on $\mathbb{CP}^1$. This generalizes \cite{BM} where $H$ was assumed to be a finite abelian group.</description>

      <title>The Classification of the Stable Marked Reduction of Genus 2 Curves in Residue Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a hyperelliptic curve of genus $2$ over a field $K$ of characteristic zero. After extending $K$ we can view it as a marked curve with its $6$ Weierstrass points. We classify the structure of the stable reduction of such curves for a valuation of residue characteristic~$2$ over a finite extension of~$K$. We implement this classification into a computer algebra system and compute it for all curves defined over $\BQ$ with conductor at most $2^{20}$.</description>

      <title>Class field theory for function fields and finite abelian torsors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a smooth and connected curve over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, with smooth compactification $X$. We generalize classical Geometric Class Field theory to provide a classification of fppf $G$-torsors over $U$ in terms of isogenies of generalized Jacobians, for any finite abelian group scheme $G$. We then apply this classification to give a novel description of the abelianized Nori fundmental group scheme of $U$ in terms of the Serre--Oort fundamental groups of generalized Jacobians of $X$; when $U=X$ is projective, we recover a well known description of the abelianized fundamental group scheme of $X$ as the projective limit of all torsion subgroup schemes of its Jacobian.</description>

      <title>Non-archimedean topological mirror symmetry for $SL_n$ and $PGL_n$ Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hausel-Thaddeus conjectures concern topological mirror symmetry between moduli spaces of $SL_n$ and $PGL_n$ Higgs bundles on a curve. A non-archimedean approach was introduced by Groechenig, Wyss and Ziegler, proving the conjecture for coprime rank and degree. This article is concerned with its generalisation to the non-coprime case. We treat both the classical ($D=K$) and meromorphic ($D&gt;K$) settings. We prove an equality of $p$-adic volumes twisted by gerbes between moduli spaces of $SL_n$ and $PGL_n$ Higgs bundles of arbitrary degree. In the meromorphic case, building on results of Maulik and Shen, we show that these twisted $p$-adic volumes are related to intersection cohomology. We also conjecture a connection between these $p$-adic volumes and $BPS$ cohomology.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Likelihood Degree of Toric Models is Monotonic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle a conjecture by Coons and Sullivant stating that the maximum likelihood (ML) degree of a facial submodel of a toric model is at most the ML degree of the model itself. We discuss the impact on the ML degree from observing zeros in the data. Moreover, we connect this problem to tropical likelihood degenerations, and show how the results can be applied to discrete graphical and quasi-independence models.</description>

      <title>New components of Hilbert schemes of points and 2-step ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents new examples of elementary and non-elementary irreducible components of the Hilbert scheme of points and its nested variants. The results are achieved via a careful analysis of the deformations of a class of finite colength ideals that are introduced in this paper and referred to as 2-step ideals. The most notable reducibility results pertain to the 4-nested Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth surface, the reducibility of $\text{Hilb}^{3,7}\mathbb{A}^4$, and a method to detect a large number of generically reduced elementary components. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we provide an explicit description of 215 new generically reduced elementary components in dimensions 4, 5 and 6.</description>

      <title>Osculating Geometry and Higher-Order Distance Loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of optimizing the distance function from a given point, subject to polynomial constraints. A key algebraic invariant that governs its complexity is the Euclidean distance degree, which pertains to first-order tangency. We focus on the data locus of points possessing at least one critical point of the distance function that is normal to a higher-order osculating space. We propose a novel definition of higher-order distance degree as an intersection-theoretic invariant involving jet bundles and higher-order polar classes. Our research yields closed formulas for generic maps, Veronese embeddings, and toric embeddings. We place particular emphasis on the Bombieri-Weyl metric, revealing that the chosen metric profoundly influences both the degree and birationality of the higher-order projection maps. Additionally, we introduce a tropical framework that represents these degrees as stable intersections with Bergman fans, facilitating effective combinatorial computation in toric settings.</description>

      <title>Proof of a magnificent conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by super-Yang-Mills theory on a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, Nekrasov and Piazzalunga have assigned weights to $r$-tuples of solid partitions and conjectured a formula for their weighted generating function.
  We define $K$-theoretic virtual invariants of Quot schemes of 0-dimensional quotients of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^4}^{\oplus r}$ by realizing them as zero loci of isotropic sections of orthogonal bundles on non-commutative Quot schemes. Via the Oh-Thomas localization formula, we recover Nekrasov-Piazzalunga's weights and derive their sign rule.
  Our proof passes through refining the $K$-theoretic invariants to sheaves and describing them via Clifford modules, which lets us show that they arise from a factorizable sequence of sheaves in the sense of Okounkov. Taking limits of the equivariant parameters, we then deduce the Nekrasov-Piazzalunga conjecture from its 3-dimensional analog.</description>

      <title>Handlebodies, Outer space, and tropical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of graphs $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ is a polyhedral object that mimics the behavior of the moduli spaces $M_{g,n}$, $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ of (stable) Riemann surfaces; this relationship has been made precise in several different ways, which collectively identify $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ as the "tropicalization" of $M_{g,n}$. We describe how this relationship lifts to some objects that live over $M_{g,n}$ (like Teichm\"uller space) and that live over $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ (like the Culler-Vogtmann space $CV_{g,n}^*$). We introduce the notion of a stable complex handlebody, and show that $CV_{g,n}^*$ can be viewed as the tropicalization of a certain complex manifold $hT(V_{g,n})$ that parametrizes complex handlebodies. An important ingredient is our construction of a partial compactification $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})\supset hT(V_{g,n})$, which we prove is a complex manifold with simple normal crossings boundary. When $n=0$, $hT(V_{g,n})$ coincides with the moduli space of Schottky groups, $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})$ coincides with Gerritzen-Herrlich's extended Schottky space, and $CV_{g,0}^*$ is the simplicial completion of the original Outer space. The resulting picture fits together many familiar objects from geometric group theory and surface topology, including Harvey's curve complex, mapping class groups of surfaces and handlebodies, and augmented Teichm\"uller space. Many of the relationships between the objects that we see in this picture already exist in the literature, but we add some new ones, and generalize several existing relationships to include a number $n&gt;0$ of punctures/leaves.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $J_m$ the Jacobian variety of the hyperelliptic curve defined by the affine equation $y^2=x^m+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $m \geq 3$ is a fixed positive integer. In this paper, we compute the Sato-Tate group of $J_m$. Currently, there is no general algorithm that computes this invariant. We also describe the Sato-Tate group of an abelian variety, generalizing existing results that apply only to non-degenerate varieties, and prove an extension of a well-known formula of Gross-Koblitz that relates values of the classical and $p$-adic gamma functions at rational arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the spectrum of the quantum (or Dubrovin) connection of smooth projective surfaces under blow-ups. Our main result is that for small values of the parameters, the quantum spectrum of such a surface is asymptotically the union of the quantum spectrum of a minimal model of the surface and a finite number of additional points located "close to infinity", that correspond bijectively to the exceptional divisors. This proves a conjecture of Kontsevich in the surface case.</description>

      <title>Lattice 3-polytopes of lattice width 2 and corresponding toric hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kodaira dimension of a nondegenerate toric hypersurface can be computed from the dimension of the Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work of Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior of the Newton polytope is the subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least $1$ to all integral supporting hyperplanes. In particular, if we have a Fine interior of codimension $1$, then the hypersurface is of general type and the Newton polytope has lattice width $2$. In this article we study this situation for lattice $3$-polytopes and the corresponding surfaces of general type. In particular, we classify all $2$-dimensional Fine interiors of those lattice $3$-polytopes which have at most $40$ interior lattice points, thus obtaining many examples of surfaces of general type and genus at most $40$.</description>

Abstract: Using methods of stable homotopy theory, the category of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves associated with non-commutative graded algebras with extra symmetries is introduced and studied in this paper. It is shown to be a closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category with invertible generators. It is proven that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a projective scheme is recovered out of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves. As an application, symmetric projective schemes associated to such algebras are introduced and studied. It is shown that classical projective schemes are recovered from symmetric ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of toric Landau-Ginzburg models under extremal contraction and minimal model program. We also establish a relation between the moduli space of toric Landau-Ginzburg models and the geography of central models. We conjecture that there is a correspondence between extremal contractions and minimal model program on Fano varieties, and degenerations of their associated toric Landau-Ginzburg models written explicitly. We prove the conjectures for smooth toric varieties, as well as general smooth Fano varieties in dimensions 2 and 3. As an application, we compute the elementary syzygies for smooth Fano threefolds.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Symmetry as a Source of Algebraic Cycles: Non-Constructive Methods for the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical variational Hodge structure theory characterizes the algebraicity of Hodge classes by studying the transversality of period mappings under geometric deformations. However, when algebraic varieties lack appropriate deformation families, this method faces applicability limitations. This paper develops a non-constructive method based on exceptional Lie group constraints to handle such cases. Our main technical contribution is establishing a dimension control mechanism for Spencer cohomology theory under Lie group constraints. Specifically, we prove that when a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ is equipped with $E_7$ group constraints, the corresponding Spencer kernel $\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1}$ has complex dimension simultaneously constrained by two bounds: representation theory gives the lower bound $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} \geq 56$, while the degenerate Spencer-de Rham mapping gives the upper bound $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} \leq h^{1,1}(X)$. For 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds satisfying $h^{1,1}(X) = 56$, this dimension constraint becomes the equality $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}\mathcal{K}_\lambda^{1,1} = 56 = h^{1,1}(X)$. Combined with our established Spencer-calibration equivalence principle, this dimension matching result is sufficient to verify the $(1,1)$-type Hodge conjecture. Our proof completely avoids explicit algebraic cycle construction, instead achieving the goal through abstract dimensional arguments. This method demonstrates the application potential of Lie group representation theory in algebraic geometry, providing new theoretical tools for handling geometric objects where traditional deformation methods are not applicable.</description>

      <title>Perfectly generated $t$-structures for algebraic stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies $t$-structures for the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact quasi-separated algebraic stack. Specifically, using Thomason filtrations, we classify those $t$-structures which are generated by perfect complexes and satisfy a tensor compatibility. Interestingly, the only input required is the classification \`{a} la Hrbek for the affine scheme case.</description>

      <title>Coherent six-functor formalisms: Pro vs Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical theory for coherent sheaves, the only missing piece in the Grothendieck six-functor formalism picture is $j_!$ for an open immersion $j$. Towards fixing this gap,classically Deligne proposed a construction of $j_!$ by extending the sheaf class to pro sheaves, while Clausen-Scholze provided another solution by extending the sheaf class to solid modules. In this work, we prove that Deligne's construction coincides with the Clausen-Scholze construction via a natural functor, whose restriction to the full subcategory of Mittag-Leffler pro-systems is fully faithful.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic invariants: straightforward from the general Markov to equivariant models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, some algebraic tools have been successfully applied to phylogenetic reconstruction. These tools are mainly based on the knowledge of equations describing algebraic varieties associated to phylogenetic trees evolving under Markov processes of molecular substitution, the so called phylogenetic invariants. Although the theory involved allows to explicitly obtain these equations for all equivariant models (which include some of the most popular nucleotide substitution models), practical uses of these algebraic tools have been restricted to the case of the general Markov model. Arguably, one of the reasons for this restriction is that knowledge of linear representation theory is required before making these equations explicit.
  With the aim of enlarging the practical uses of algebraic phylogenetics, in this paper we prove that phylogenetic invariants for trees evolving under equivariant models can be derived from phylogenetic invariants for the general Markov model, without the need of representation theory. Our main result states that the algebraic variety corresponding to a phylogenetic tree evolving under an equivariant model is an irreducible component of the variety corresponding to the same tree under the general Markov model cut with the linear space defined by the model. We also prove that, for any equivariant model, those phylogenetic invariants that are relevant for practical uses (e.g. tree reconstruction) can be simply deduced from a single rank constraint on the matrices obtained by flattening the joint distribution at the leaves of the tree. This condition can be easily tested from singular values of the matrices and extends our results from trees to phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denote by $J_m$ the Jacobian variety of the hyperelliptic curve defined by the affine equation $y^2=x^m+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $m \geq 3$ is a fixed positive integer. We compute several interesting arithmetic invariants of $J_m$: its decomposition up to isogeny into simple abelian varieties, the minimal field $\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$ over which its endomorphisms are defined, and its connected monodromy field $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})$. Currently, there is no general algorithm that computes the last invariant. For large enough values of $m$, the abelian varieties $J_m$ provide non-trivial examples of high-dimensional phenomena, such as degeneracy and the non-triviality of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})/\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$.</description>

      <title>The Fine interior of dilations of a rational polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nondegenerate toric hypersurface of negative Kodaira dimension can be characterized by the empty Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work by Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior is the rational subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least 1 to all integral supporting hyperplanes of the Newton polytope. Moreover, we get more information in this situation if we can describe how the Fine interior behaves for dilations of the Newton polytope, e.g. if we can determine the smallest dilation with a non-empty Fine interior. Therefore, in this article we give a purely combinatorial description of the Fine interiors of all dilations of a rational polytope, which allows us in particular to compute this smallest dilation and to classify all lattice 3-polytopes with empty Fine interior, for which we have only one point as Fine interior of the smallest dilation with non-empty Fine interior.</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. In the 8d case, one can also derive higher $A_{\infty}$-categories, such as a novel Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-3-category that 3-categorifies the Haydys-Witten Floer homology of four-manifolds via a 4d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the theory. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], our work furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3], Doan-Rezchikov [4], and Cao [5].</description>
