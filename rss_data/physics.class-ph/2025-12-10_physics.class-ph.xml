      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on rotational phenomena of rigid body kinematics. It discusses them in a group-theoretic approach as completely as possible, using methods and notations as intuitive as possible. With a review of current literature, this article also covers some original parts that remain largely unexplored.</description>

      <title>Thermal stability originates the vanishing of the specific heats at the absolute zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05129v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}&gt;0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Normal form computation of nonlinear dispersion relationship for locally resonant metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the application of the parametrisation method for invariant manifold with a complex normal form style (CNF), for the derivation of high-order approximations of underdamped nonlinear dispersion relationships for periodic structures, more specifically by considering the case of a locally resonant metamaterial chain incorporating damping and various nonlinear stiffnesses. Two different strategies are proposed to solve the problem. In the first one, Bloch's assumption is first applied to the equations of motion, and then the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the complex normal form style in the parametrisation method is applied. This direct procedure, which applies first the wave dependency to the original physical coordinates of the problem, is referred to as CNF-BP (for CNF applied with Bloch's assumption on physical coordinates). In the second strategy, the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the parametrisation method, which relates the physical coordinates to the so-called normal coordinates, is first applied. Then the periodic assumption is used, thus imposing a Bloch wave ansatz on the normal coordinates. This method will be referred to as CNF-PN (for CNF with a periodic assumption on normal coordinates). In the conservative case, the CNF-PN strategy exhibits superior capability in capturing complex wave propagation phenomena, whereas the CNF-BP strategy encounters limitations in handling non-fundamental harmonics and the nonlinear interactions between host oscillators. For underdamped systems, the CNF-PN is rigorously validated and systematically compared against numerical techniques, a classical analytical perturbation technique (the method of multiple scales), and direct numerical time integration of annular chain structures.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a paraboloidal cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classical and quantum analysis of a particle confined in a three-dimensional paraboloidal cavity formed by two confocal paraboloids. Classically, the system is integrable and presents three independent constants of motion, namely, the energy, the $z$-component of the angular momentum, and a third dynamical constant associated with the paraboloidal geometry, which can be derived from the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schr\"odinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones.</description>

      <title>Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical model for wire rolling is developed, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations, assuming a rigid, perfectly plastic material and exploiting the thinness of the wire (in thickness and width) relative to the roller size. Results are compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using 100mm diameter rolls, demonstrating accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. Since the model requires only seconds to compute, the model's valid range is explored for varying roll diameter, wire diameter, and reduction ratio, and their effects on the resulting lateral spread characterized. The model can serve as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models. Matlab code to evaluate the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic fields from single atomic or molecular radiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework is introduced for expressing electromagnetic (EM) potentials and fields of single atomic or molecular emitters modeled as oscillating dipoles, which follows a recently proposed method for solving inhomogeneous wave equations for arbitrary, time-dependent distributions of charge. This framework is first used to evaluate the physical implications of simplifying assumptions made in the standard approach to quantization of the EM fields and the impact of such assumptions on the results of energy and momentum quantization. Then, the exact expressions for the EM potentials and fields, in relation to the oscillating (transition) dipoles properties, afforded by the present framework are used to quantize electromagnetic fields from single emitters and restore the agreement with the well-known classical dipole radiation pattern, while maintaining the quantum mechanical description of electromagnetic radiation in terms of the probability distribution of quantum modes. Contributions of the present analysis to the understanding of photon emission from excited atoms or molecules stimulated by light or vacuum field fluctuations are highlighted, and possible experimental tests and practical applications are proposed.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
