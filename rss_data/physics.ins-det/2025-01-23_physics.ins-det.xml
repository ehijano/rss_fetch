      <title>Potential of RES-NOVA as Dark Matter observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RES-NOVA project is an experimental initiative aimed at detecting neutrinos from the next galactic supernova using PbWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors, operated at low temperatures in a low-background environment. By utilizing archaeological lead (Pb) as the target material, RES-NOVA leverages its high radiopurity, large nuclear mass, and the natural abundance of $^{207}$Pb, making it well-suited for exploring both spin-independent and spin-dependent Dark Matter (DM) interactions via nuclear scattering. This work presents a background model developed for the RES-NOVA technology demonstrator and evaluates its implications for Dark Matter detection. Detailed calculations of nuclear matrix elements, combined with the unique properties of archaeological Pb, demonstrate RES-NOVA's potential as a complementary tool to existing direct detection experiments for studying Dark Matter interactions. The experiment will conduct DM searches over a broad mass range spanning 4 orders of magnitude, from sub-GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$. In the most optimistic scenario, RES-NOVA is expected to probe DM-nucleon cross-sections down to 1$\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ and 2$\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for candidates with masses of 2 GeV/$c^2$ and 20 GeV/$c^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Tagging Efficiency Study of Incoherent Diffractive Vector Meson Production at the Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is an upcoming accelerator facility aimed at exploring the properties of quarks and gluons in nucleons and nuclei, shedding light on their structure and dynamics. The inaugural experimental apparatus, ePIC (electron-Proton and Ion Collider), is designed as a general purpose detector to address the NAS/NSAC physics program at the EIC. The wider EIC community is strongly supporting a second interaction region and associated second detector to enhance the full science program. In this study, we evaluate how the second interaction region and detector can be complementary to ePIC. The pre-conceptual layout of an interaction region for the second detector offers a secondary focus that provides better forward detector acceptance at scattering angles near $\theta \sim 0$~mrad, which can specifically enhance the exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics program. This article presents an analysis of a tagging program using the second interaction region layout with incoherent diffractive vector meson production. The potential for the second interaction region to provide improved vetoing capabilities for incoherent events to elucidate the coherent diffractive cross-section is evaluated. The capability to access the coherent diffractive cross-section is of prime importance for studying the spatial imaging of nucleons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dot Based Chromatic Calorimetry: A proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic calorimetry introduces a novel approach to calorimeter design in High Energy Physics (HEP) by integrating Quantum Dot (QD) technology into traditional homogeneous calorimeters. The tunable emission spectra of QDs provide new possibilities for energy reconstruction and potentially improved particle identification in homogeneous devices. This paper presents the initial conceptual design of a chromatic calorimeter aimed at validating the feasibility of QD-based chromatic calorimetry. The study evaluates its expected performance through detailed simulations, comparing the results to the existing calorimetric technologies. By embedding QDs with distinct emission properties within scintillators, we aim to improve both timing resolution and longitudinal segmentation, thus opening new avenues for precision measurements in future HEP experiments. While further development and validation are required, QD-enhanced detectors may represent a viable option for future HEP experiments, providing an additional tool for addressing the evolving demands of particle detection.</description>

      <title>The Black Metal Tribometer: high-resolution measurement of normal load-indentation curves and partial slip hysteresis cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new instrument has been designed for measuring frictional hysteresis cycles and normal load-indentation curves. The primary purpose of the BMT is the validation of more predictive modeling approaches for damping in friction joints. An important original feature of the BMT is its ability to measure both normal and tangential contact behavior without having to separate the samples. Special attention was paid to alignment and smooth motion in order to permit testing nominally flat-on-flat contacts in the microslip regime. Examples are shown for finely resolved, undistorted hysteresis cycles with relative tangential displacement amplitudes in the sub-micrometer range at about 50 MPa nominal normal pressure, which is maintained well over the tangential load cycle.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone for acoustic neutrino detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and characterization of a fiber laser hydrophone designed for deep-sea applications, with a focus on detecting neutrino interactions via their acoustic signatures. The hydrophone design includes a static pressure compensation mechanism, ensuring reliable operation at depths exceeding 1 km. The performance of the hydrophone was evaluated through laboratory tests and experiments in an anechoic basin, where its transfer function was measured before and after a 140-bar pressure cycle. The results show that the hydrophone maintains its sensitivity, with resonance peaks identified in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The hydrophone's sensitivity to acoustic signals was also compared to ambient sea state noise levels, demonstrating compatibility with the lowest noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Performance of an instrumented baffle placed at the entrance of Virgo's end mirror vacuum tower during O5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present results on the simulated performance of an instrumented baffle installed at the entrance of the vacuum towers hosting the end mirrors of Virgo's main Fabry-P\'erot cavities. The installation of instrumented baffles is part of the Advanced Virgo Plus upgrade in time for the O5 observing run. They were originally envisaged to be suspended, mounted on new payloads and surrounding new larger end mirrors. The current Virgo upgrade plan includes the replacement of the mirrors with new ones of better quality and same dimensions, leaving the installation of new payloads and larger end mirrors to a post-O5 upgrade phase still to be defined. Here we demonstrate that placing the instrumented baffles just beyond the cryotrap gate valve and in front of the end mirrors would be equally effective for monitoring scattered light inside the cavities. This new location, more than a meter away from the mirror, further reduces the risk of contamination and any potential interference with the mirrors, preserves the full capability to monitor scattered light, and decouples the instrumented baffle timeline from the plans for installing large mirrors in the experiment. We provide an estimate of the light distribution the baffles would encounter under both nominal and non-nominal conditions, as well as an assessment of the scattered light noise introduced by these baffles in this new location, confirming that they would not compromise Virgo's sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Track reconstruction as a service for collider physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing charged-particle track reconstruction algorithms is crucial for efficient event reconstruction in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments due to their significant computational demands. Existing track reconstruction algorithms have been adapted to run on massively parallel coprocessors, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), to reduce processing time. Nevertheless, challenges remain in fully harnessing the computational capacity of coprocessors in a scalable and non-disruptive manner. This paper proposes an inference-as-a-service approach for particle tracking in high energy physics experiments. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, two distinct tracking algorithms are tested: Patatrack, a rule-based algorithm, and Exa$.$TrkX, a machine learning-based algorithm. The as-a-service implementations show enhanced GPU utilization and can process requests from multiple CPU cores concurrently without increasing per-request latency. The impact of data transfer is minimal and insignificant compared to running on local coprocessors. This approach greatly improves the computational efficiency of charged particle tracking, providing a solution to the computing challenges anticipated in the High-Luminosity LHC era.</description>
