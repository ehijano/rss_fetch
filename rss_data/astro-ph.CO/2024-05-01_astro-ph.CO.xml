      <title>Intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ haloes before reionization are detectable with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope \ (JWST)$ recently reported a large population of UV luminous galaxies at high redshifts, $ z &gt; 10$, as well as Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting (LAE) galaxies out to $z \sim 11$. We use the observed UV luminosities along with a data-driven approach at lower redshifts to place constraints on the observability of the intergalactic Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity, scattered in the form of Loeb-Rybicki haloes, during the pre-reionization and reionization epochs ($z \sim 9-16$). We forecast the sensitivity and resolution required to detect these intergalactic haloes, finding that individual haloes with LAE luminosities $&gt; 10^{43}$ ergs/s are detectable at a few sigma level at $z \lesssim 11$, while stacking of $\sim 10$ haloes is expected to result in detections out to $z \sim 16$. Finding these haloes is expected to shed light on the neutral intergalactic hydrogen during cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on spatially-flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and XCDM cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 6 LCDM models, with 4 allowing for non-flat geometry and 3 allowing for a non-unity lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We also study 6 XCDM models with a dynamical dark energy density X-fluid with equation of state $w$. For the non-flat models we use two different primordial power spectra, Planck $P(q)$ and new $P(q)$. These models are tested against: Planck 2018 CMB power spectra (P18) and lensing potential power spectrum (lensing), and an updated compilation of BAO, SNIa, $H(z)$, and $f\sigma_8$ data [non-CMB data]. P18 data favor closed geometry for the LCDM and XCDM models and $w&lt;-1$ (phantom-like dark energy) for the XCDM models while non-CMB data favor open geometry for the LCDM models and closed geometry and $w&gt;-1$ (quintessence-like dark energy) for the XCDM models. When P18 and non-CMB data are jointly analyzed there is weak evidence for open geometry and moderate evidence for quintessence-like dark energy. Regardless of data used, $A_L&gt;1$ is always favored. The XCDM model constraints obtained from CMB data and from non-CMB data are incompatible, ruling out the 3 $A_L = 1$ XCDM models at $&gt; 3\sigma$. In the 9 models not ruled out, for the P18+lensing+non-CMB data set we find little deviation from flat geometry and moderate deviation from $w=-1$. In all 6 non-flat models (not ruled out), open geometry is mildly favored, and in all 3 XCDM+$A_L$ models (not ruled out) quintessence-like dark energy is moderately favored (by at most $1.6 \sigma$). In the $A_L = 1$ non-flat LCDM cases, we find for P18+lensing+non-CMB data $\Omega_k = 0.0009 \pm 0.0017$ [$0.0008 \pm 0.0017$] for the Planck [new] $P(q)$ model, favoring open geometry. The flat LCDM model remains the simplest (largely) observationally-consistent cosmological model. Our cosmological parameter constraints obtained for the flat LCDM model (and other models) are the most restrictive results to date (Abridged).</description>

      <title>Neutrinos in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos are the least known particle in the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. They play a crucial role in cosmology, governing the universe's evolution and shaping the large-scale structures we observe today. In this chapter, we review crucial topics in neutrino cosmology, such as the neutrino decoupling process in the very early universe. We shall also revisit the current constraints on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom and the departures from its standard expectation of 3. Neutrino masses represent the very first departure from the Standard Model of elementary particle physics and may imply the existence of new unexplored mass generation mechanisms. Cosmology provides the tightest bound on the sum of neutrino masses, and we shall carefully present the nature of these constraints, both on the total mass of the neutrinos and on their precise spectrum. The ordering of the neutrino masses plays a major role in the design of future neutrino mass searches from laboratory experiments, such as neutrinoless double beta decay probes. Finally, we shall also present the futuristic perspectives for an eventual direct detection of cosmic, relic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Quintom cosmology and modified gravity after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) \cite{DESI:2024mwx} combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

      <title>Prospects for weighing neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations to constrain the total neutrino mass in some typical interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We examine the combined potential of the third-generation ground-based GW detector network and a short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector similar to the THESEUS telescope for cosmological analysis. Our findings suggest that future GW standard siren observations could modestly refine the upper limit on the total neutrino mass, enhancing it by $5\%$ to $10\%$ over the existing limit given by the CMB+BAO+SN data. Additionally, the future observations are expected to significantly improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$. Moreover, the measurements could enhance the precision of the coupling strength $\beta$ by $23\%$ to $42\%$.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations from inflation in the presence of gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how Abelian-gauge-field production during inflation affects scalar perturbations in the case when the gauge field interacts with the inflaton directly (by means of generic kinetic and axial couplings) and via gravity. The homogeneous background solution is defined by self-consistently taking into account the backreaction of the gauge field on the evolution of the inflaton and the scale factor. For the perturbations on top of this background, all possible scalar contributions coming from the inflaton, the metric, and the gauge field are considered. We derive a second-order differential equation for the curvature perturbation, $\zeta$, capturing the impact of the gauge field, both on the background dynamics and on the evolution of scalar perturbations. The latter is described by a source term in the $\zeta$-equation, which is quadratic in the gauge-field operators and leads to non-Gaussianities in the curvature perturbations. We derive general expressions for the induced scalar power spectrum and bispectrum. Finally, we apply our formalism to the well-known case of axion inflation without backreaction. Numerical results show that, in this example, the effect of including metric perturbations is small for values of the gauge-field production parameter $\xi&gt; 3$. This is in agreement with the results of previous studies in the literature. However, in the region of smaller values, $\xi\lesssim 2$, our new results exhibit order-of-unity deviations when compared to previous results.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities in Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the earlier linear studies of cosmological peculiar velocities to Friedmann universes with nonzero spatial curvature. In the process, we also compare our results with those obtained in cosmologies with Euclidean spatial sections. Employing relativistic cosmological perturbation theory, we first provide the differential formulae governing the evolution of peculiar velocities on all Friedmann backgrounds. The technical complexities of the curved models, however, mean that analytic solutions are possible only in special, though characteristic, moments in the lifetime of these universes. Nevertheless, our solutions exhibit persistent patterns that make us confident enough to generalise them. Thus, we confirm earlier claims that, compared to the Newtonian studies, the relativistic analysis supports considerably stronger linear growth-rates for peculiar-velocity perturbations. This result holds irrespective of the background curvature. Moreover, for positive curvature, the peculiar growth-rate is found to be faster than that obtained in a spatially flat Friedman universe. In contrast, linear peculiar velocities appear to grow at a slower pace when their Friedmann host is spatially open. Extrapolating them to the present, our results seem to suggest faster bulk peculiar motions in overdense, rather than in underdense, regions of the universe.</description>

      <title>Into the MAG-verse or: Cosmology of the Complete Quadratic Metric-Affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of the complete quadratic (in torsion and nonmetricity) metric-affine gravity. Namely, we add to the scalar-curvature gravitational Lagrangian, the 17 independent quadratic (parity-even and parity-odd) torsion and nonmetricity invariants. Sticking to a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and assuming a perfect hyperfluid source, we explore the new effects that torsion and nonmetricity bring into play. It is shown that the inclusion of these invariants offers rich phenomenology. In particular, some well-known examples of exotic matter like cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff matter, etc., emerge quite naturally as manifestations of the fluid's intrinsic structure (hypermomentum). By studying the extended Friedmann equations in the complete quadratic theory and isolating the various parts of the hypermomentum, we find a plethora of solutions with interesting features.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. How these two contributions are distributed has not been seriously investigated. Meanwhile, a dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields, whose application to cosmology is not straightforward. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral gravitational waves around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that resembles the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis scenario. This approach allows us to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we conjecture that level-crossing does not seem to be efficient while the charge accumulation in the vacuum likely takes place. Phenomenological implication is also discussed in the context of gravitational leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Inference of cosmological models with principal component analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination of cosmological parameters is a major goal in cosmology at present. The availability of improved data sets necessitates the development of novel statistical tools to interpret the inference from a cosmological model. In this paper, we combine the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to infer the parameters of cosmological models. We use the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) to run the MCMC chains in the model parameter space. After determining the observable by PCA, we replace the observational and error parts of the likelihood analysis with the PCA reconstructed observable and find the most preferred model parameter set. As a demonstration of our methodology, we assume a polynomial expansion as the parametrization of the dark energy equation of state and plug it in the reconstruction algorithm as our model. After testing our methodology with simulated data, we apply the same to the observed data sets, the Hubble parameter data, Supernova Type Ia data, and the Baryon Acoustic oscillation data. This method effectively constrains cosmological parameters from data, including sparse data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider black hole formation due to the gravitational collapse produced by large density fluctuations during an epoch of reheating with a stiff equation of state and calculate the induced gravitational wave spectrum. By considering the existing bounds on the total energy density of gravitational waves today, we find constraints on the parameter space of this scenario. We also calculate the lepton asymmetry generated by metric perturbations via the chiral gravitational anomaly present in the Standard Model and find that, once the electroweak sphaleron processes have taken place, the large spectrum of scalar perturbations responsible for black hole formation induces a peak in the baryon asymmetry fluctuations on small scales.</description>

      <title>First upper limits on the 21 cm signal power spectrum from cosmic dawn from one night of observations with NenuFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The redshifted 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen is a direct probe of the physics of the early universe and has been an important science driver of many present and upcoming radio interferometers. In this study we use a single night of observations with the New Extension in Nan\c{c}ay Upgrading LOFAR (NenuFAR) to place upper limits on the 21 cm power spectrum from cosmic dawn at a redshift of $z$ = 20.3. NenuFAR is a new low-frequency radio interferometer, operating in the 10-85 MHz frequency range, currently under construction at the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Observatory in France. It is a phased array instrument with a very dense uv coverage at short baselines, making it one of the most sensitive instruments for 21 cm cosmology analyses at these frequencies. Our analysis adopts the foreground subtraction approach, in which sky sources are modeled and subtracted through calibration and residual foregrounds are subsequently removed using Gaussian process regression. The final power spectra are constructed from the gridded residual data cubes in the uv plane. Signal injection tests are performed at each step of the analysis pipeline, the relevant pipeline settings are optimized to ensure minimal signal loss, and any signal suppression is accounted for through a bias correction on our final upper limits. We obtain a best 2$\sigma$ upper limit of $2.4\times 10^7$ $\text{mK}^{2}$ at $z$ = 20.3 and $k$ = 0.041 $h\,\text{cMpc}^{-1}$. We see a strong excess power in the data, making our upper limits two orders of magnitude higher than the thermal noise limit. We investigate the origin and nature of this excess power and discuss further improvements to the analysis pipeline that can potentially mitigate it and consequently allow us to reach thermal noise sensitivity when multiple nights of observations are processed in the future.</description>

      <title>Finding origins of CMB anomalies in the inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present compelling evidence for the parity asymmetry (a discrete symmetry that is separate from isotropy) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map, measured through two-point temperature correlations. This parity asymmetric CMB challenges our understanding of the quantum physics of the early Universe rather than LCDM ($\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter). We commence by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Planck CMB, focusing on the distribution of power in low-multipoles and temperature anticorrelations at parity conjugate points in position space. We find tension with the near scale-invariant power-law power spectrum of Standard Inflation (SI), with p-values of the order $\mathcal{O}\left( 10^{-4}-10^{-3} \right)$. Alternatively, we explore the framework of direct-sum inflation (DSI), where a quantum fluctuation arises as a direct-sum of two components evolving forward and backward in time at parity conjugate points in physical space. We found that DSI is consistent with data on parity asymmetry, the absence of power at $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, and power suppression at low-even-multipoles, which are major data anomalies in the SI. Furthermore, we discover that the parameters characterizing the hemispherical power asymmetry anomaly become statistically insignificant when the large SI quadrupole amplitude is reduced to align with the data. DSI explains this low quadrupole with a p-value of $3.5\%$, 39 times higher than SI. Combining statistics from parameters measuring parity and low-$\ell$ angular power spectrum, we find that DSI is 50-650 times more probable than SI. In summary, our investigation suggests that CMB temperature fluctuations exhibit homogeneity and isotropy but parity-asymmetric consistent with predictions of DSI. This observation provides tantalizing evidence for the quantum mechanical nature of gravity.</description>

This is because baryon number violating (BNV) operators containing only the zero mode of bulk fermions must satisfy the selection rule $\frac{3}{2} \Delta B \pm \frac{1}{2}\Delta L = 0 \ mod \ 4$. In this article, we show that the above relation does not prohibit mass dimension-6 BNV operators containing Kaluza Klein (KK) partners of the bulk fermions. Together with `spinless' adjoint scalar partner of hypercharge gauge boson (the Dark Matter candidate), these novel operators generate Dark Matter assisted proton decay at mass dimension-8. Here, with explicit examples of scalar and vector baryon number violating interactions, we discuss the importance of such $\Delta B=1 =\Delta L$ and $\Delta B=2=\Delta L$ operators and derive the limit on New Physics.</description>

      <title>The viability of low-mass subhaloes as targets for gamma-ray dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the discovery potential of low-mass Galactic dark matter (DM) subhaloes for indirect searches of DM. We use data from the Via Lactea II (VL-II) N-body cosmological simulation, which resolves subhaloes down to $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ solar masses and it is thus ideal for this purpose. First, we characterize the abundance, distribution and structural properties of the VL-II subhalo population in terms of both subhalo masses and maximum circular velocities. Then, we repopulate the original simulation with millions of subhaloes of masses down to about five orders of magnitude below the minimum VL-II subhalo mass (more than one order of magnitude in velocities). We compute subhalo DM annihilation astrophysical "J-factors" and angular sizes for the entire subhalo population, by placing the Earth at a random position but at the right galactocentric distance in the simulation. Thousands of these realizations are generated in order to obtain statistically meaningful results. We find that some nearby low-mass Galactic subhaloes, not massive enough to retain stars or gas, may indeed yield DM annihilation fluxes comparable to those expected from other, more massive and acknowledgeable DM targets like dwarf satellite galaxies. Typical angular sizes are of the order of the degree, thus subhaloes potentially appearing as extended sources in gamma-ray telescopes, depending on instrument angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work shows that low-mass Galactic subhaloes with no visible counterparts are expected to play a relevant role in current and future indirect DM search searches and should indeed be considered as excellent DM targets.</description>

      <title>Image of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by equatorial thin accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16944v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore the influence of the cosmological constant on black hole images, we have developed a comprehensive analytical method for simulating images of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by equatorial thin accretion disks. Through the application of explicit equations, we simulate images of Kerr-de Sitter black holes illuminated by both prograde and retrograde accretion disks, examining the impact of the cosmological constant on their characteristic curves, relative sizes, and observed intensities. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to Kerr black holes, the cosmological constant not only diminishes the relative size of a black hole but also amplifies its luminosity. Moreover, an observer's relative position in the universe ($r_0/r_C$) can influence both the relative size and luminosity of a black hole, where $r_0$ is the distance from the observer to the black hole, $r_C$ is the cosmological horizon determined by the value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in gravitational waves and observational bounds from third-generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze parity-violating effects in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs). For this purpose, we adopt a newly proposed parametrized post-Einstenian (PPE) formalism, which encodes modified gravity corrections to the phase and amplitude of GW waveforms. In particular, we focus our study on three well-known examples of parity-violating theories, namely Chern-Simons, Symmetric Teleparallel and Hor\v ava-Lishitz gravity. For each model, we identify the PPE parameters emerging from the inclusion of parity-violating terms in the gravitational Lagrangian. Thus, we use the simulated sensitivities of third-generation GW interferometers, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, to obtain numerical bounds on the PPE coefficients and the physical parameters of binary systems. In so doing, we find that deviations from General Relativity cannot be excluded within given confidence limits. Moreover, our results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in the relative accuracy of the GW parameters compared to the values inferred from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. In this respect, the present work demonstrates the power of next-generation GW detectors to probe fundamental physics with unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Final Results of Search for New Milky Way Satellites in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Survey: Discovery of Two More Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the final results of our search for new Milky Way (MW) satellites using the data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) survey over $\sim 1,140$ deg$^2$. In addition to three candidates that we already reported, we have identified two new MW satellite candidates in the constellation of Sextans at a heliocentric distance of $D_{\odot} \simeq 126$kpc, and Virgo at $D_{\odot} \simeq 151$kpc, named Sextans II and Virgo III, respectively. Their luminosities (Sext II:$M_V\simeq-3.9$mag; Vir III:$M_V\simeq-2.7$mag) and half-light radii (Sext II:$r_h\simeq154$ pc; Vir III:$r_h\simeq 44$ pc) place them in the region of size-luminosity space of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). Including four previously known satellites, there are a total of nine satellites in the HSC-SSP footprint. This discovery rate of UFDs is much higher than that predicted from the recent models for the expected population of MW satellites in the framework of cold dark matter models, thereby suggesting that we encounter a too many satellites problem. Possible solutions to settle this tension are also discussed.</description>

      <title>SKA Sensitivity to Sub-GeV Dark Matter Decay: Synchrotron Radio Emissions in White Dwarf Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in detecting synchrotron radiation emitted from the decay of sub-GeV dark matter (dark matter with masses below the GeV scale) in the presence of strong magnetic fields. As a concrete setup, we consider scenarios where the magnetosphere of a magnetic white dwarf overlaps with dense dark matter environments, such as those surrounding a primordial black hole. Our study reveals that the encounters of compact objects such as white dwarfs and black holes offer a promising avenue for upcoming radio telescopes to probe the properties of light dark matter, which has been less explored compared with more conventional heavier (masses above the GeV scale) dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Rise and Fall of the Standard-Model Higgs: Electroweak Vacuum Stability during Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum stability of the non-minimally coupled Standard-Model Higgs during a phase of kinetic domination following the end of inflation. The non-minimal coupling to curvature stabilises the Higgs fluctuations during inflation while driving them towards the instability scale during kination, when they can classically overcome the potential barrier separating the false electroweak vacuum from the true one at super-Planckian field values. Avoiding the instability of the Standard-Model vacuum sets an upper bound on the inflationary scale that depends both on the strength of the non-minimal interaction and on the top quark Yukawa coupling. Classical vacuum stability is guaranteed if the gravitationally-produced energy density is smaller than the height of barrier in the effective potential. Interestingly enough, thanks to the explosive particle production in the tachyonic phase, the Higgs itself can be also appointed to the role of reheaton field responsible for the onset of the hot Big Bang era, setting an additional lower bound on the inflationary scale $\mathcal{H}_{\rm inf} \gtrsim 10^{5.5} \text{ GeV}$. Overall, these constraints favour lower masses for the top quark, in agreement with the current measurements of the top quark pole mass. We perform our analysis semi-analytically in terms of the one-loop and three-loop running of the Standard-Model Higgs self-coupling and make use of lattice-based parametric formulas for studying the (re)heating phase derived in arXiv:2307.03774. For a specific choice of $m_t=171.3 \text{ GeV}$ we perform also an extensive numerical scanning of the parameter space via classical lattice simulations, identifying stable/unstable regions and supporting the previous analytical arguments. For this fiducial value, the heating of the Universe is achieved at temperatures in the range $10^{-2} - 10^9 \text{ GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic variance of the Hellings and Downs correlation for ensembles of universes having non-zero angular power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induce correlated perturbations to the arrival times of pulses from an array of galactic millisecond pulsars. The expected correlations, obtained by averaging over many pairs of pulsars having the same angular separation (pulsar averaging) and over an ensemble of model universes (ensemble averaging), are described by the Hellings and Downs curve. As shown by Allen [1], the pulsar-averaged correlation will not agree exactly with the expected Hellings and Downs prediction if the gravitational-wave sources interfere with one another, differing instead by a "cosmic variance" contribution. The precise shape and size of the cosmic variance depends on the statistical properties of the ensemble of universes used to model the background. Here, we extend the calculations of the cosmic variance for the standard Gaussian ensemble to an ensemble of model universes which collectively has rotationally-invariant correlations in the GW power on different angular scales (described by an angular power spectrum, $C_\ell$ for $\ell=0,1,\cdots$.). We obtain an analytic form for the cosmic variance in terms of the $C_\ell$'s and show that for realistic values $C_{\ell}/C_0\lesssim 10^{-3}$, there is virtually no difference in the cosmic variance compared to that for the standard Gaussian ensemble (which has zero angular power spectra).</description>
