      <title>Vector bosons in the rotating frame of negative curvature wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the relativistic dynamics of vector bosons within the context of rotating frames of negative curvature wormholes. We seek exact solutions for the fully-covariant vector boson equation, derived as an excited state of zitterbewegung. This equation encompasses a symmetric rank-two spinor, enabling the derivation of a non-perturbative second-order wave equation for the system under consideration. Our findings present exact results in two distinct scenarios. Notably, we demonstrate the adaptability of our results to massless vector bosons without compromising generality. The evolution of this system is shown to correlate with the angular frequency of the uniformly rotating reference frame and the curvature radius of the wormholes. Moreover, our results highlight that the interplay between the spin of the vector boson and the angular frequency of the rotating frame can give rise to real oscillation modes, particularly evident in excited states for massless vector bosons. Intriguingly, we note that the energy spectra obtained remain the same whether the wormhole is of hyperbolic or elliptic nature.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos: dynamics and distinguishability of halo models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a key target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be affected in the presence of dark matter (DM) halos. In this paper we explore whether the effects of DM are detectable by LISA within a fully relativistic framework. We model the massive EMRI component as a nonrotating black hole (BH) surrounded by a DM halo. We compute axial and polar GW fluxes for circular orbits at linear order in the mass ratio for DM density profiles with varying mass and compactness. By comparing the phase evolution with vacuum systems, we find that DM halos can induce dephasings of tens to hundreds of radians over a one-year observation period. We demonstrate that even highly diluted DM distributions can significantly affect the emitted waveforms, and that the resulting GW signals can usually be distinguished from each other. While it is important to generalize these findings to more generic orbits and to spinning BHs, our results suggest that LISA could not only reveal the presence of DM halos, but also discriminate between different halo models.</description>

      <title>Charged Black Holes in the Kalb-Ramond Background with Lorentz Violation: Null Geodesics and Optical Appearance of a Thin Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical appearance of a charged black hole in the Kalb-Ramond background, incorporating a Lorentz-violating parameter $l=0.01$. By analyzing the null geodesics, we derive the photon sphere, event horizon, effective potential, and critical impact parameters. We then employ a ray-tracing technique to study the trajectories of photons surrounding a thin accretion disk. Three different emission models are considered to explore the observed intensity profiles of direct rings, lensing rings, and photon sphere. By comparing these results with those of the standard Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole ($l=0$) and the Kalb-Ramond black hole with different values of Lorentz-violating parameter (specifically, $l=0.05$ and $l=0.1$ respectively), we find that the Lorentz symmetry breaking will lead to a decrease in the radii of the photon sphere, the event horizon, and the innermost stable circular orbit. Consequently, this makes the detection of these black holes more challenging.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic systems approach for the good-bad-ugly model with application to general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ an adapted version of H\"ormander's asymptotic systems method to show heuristically that the standard good-bad-ugly model admits formal polyhomogeneous asymptotic solutions near null infinity. In a related earlier approach, our heuristics were unable to capture potential leading order logarithmic terms appearing in the asymptotic solution of the good equation (the standard wave equation). Presently, we work with an improved method which overcomes this shortcoming, allowing the faithful treatment of a larger class of initial data in which such logarithmic terms are manifest. We then generalize this method to encompass models that include stratified null forms as sources and whose wave operators are built from an asymptotically flat metric. We then apply this result to the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge and compute the leading decay in~$R^{-1}$ of the Weyl scalars, where~$R$ is a suitably defined radial coordinate. We detect an obstruction to peeling, a decay statement on the Weyl scalars~$\Psi_n$ that is ensured by smoothness of null infinity. The leading order obstruction appears in~$\Psi_2$ and, in agreement with the literature, can only be suppressed by a careful choice of initial</description>

      <title>GraFIT: A toolbox for fast and accurate frequency response identification in Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency response function (FRF) measurements are widely used in Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors, e.g., for the design of controllers, calibrating signals and diagnostic problems with system dynamics. The aim of this paper is to present GraFIT: a toolbox that enables fast, inexpensive, and accurate identification of FRF measurements for GW detectors compared to the commonly used approaches, including common spectral analysis techniques. The toolbox consists of a single function to estimate the frequency response function for both open-loop and closed-loop systems and for arbitrary input and output dimensions. The toolbox is validated on two experimental case studies of the Virgo detector, illustrating more than a factor 3 reduction in standard deviation of the estimate for the same measurement times, and comparable standard deviations with up to 10 times less data for the new method with respect to the currently implemented Spectral Analysis method.</description>

      <title>Leading-order deflection of particles by a moving Schwarzschild lens with a two-dimensional velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational deflection effect of relativistic massive and massless particles up to the first post-Minkowskian order caused by a moving Schwarzschild black hole with a two-dimensional equatorial velocity, which contains the radial and transversal components, is studied analytically, and a new unified formula for the deflection angle is achieved. The expression of the angle matches well with the results of the weak deflection of relativistic particles induced by a radially moving Schwarzschild source given in the literature, when the transversal component of the lens velocity vanishes. The joint velocity effect, which consists of the influences of the transversal and radial motions of the lens on the leading-order Schwarzschild deflection of the massive particles and light, is then discussed in the context of general relativity. We analyze the order of magnitude of this kinematical effect and evaluate the possibility of its astronomical detection subsequently.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Shadows Modelling in Extended gravity: Rotation Accounting and coupled effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an improved version of the Newman-Janis algorithm, we obtain metrics of rotating black holes for a set of extended gravity theories that extend general relativity in different ways: the Horndeski model, the bumblebee model, the Gauss-Bonnet scalar gravity, the loop quantum gravity, the conformal gravity, and $f(Q)$ (symmetric teleparallel gravity STEGR). The obtained metrics are used to model black hole shadows. It is shown that for some models the critical values of the angular momentum $a_{crit}$ emerge. The previous conclusion that the extended gravity theory corrects by itself the effects of rotation in both directions is confirmed. This appears to be important for further modelling of shadow profiles taking into account the constantly increasing accuracy of black hole images. Thus, when rotation is taken into account black hole shadow images, as the GW170817 test or the post-Newtonian formalism, can serve as a meaningful way to test and constrain extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Black holes and other exact solutions in six-derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exact static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions in generic six-derivative gravity (i.e., without assuming specific relations between the coupling constants). Using modified Schwarzschild coordinates, we systematically classify solutions through Frobenius expansions, determining their number of free parameters and confirming previously known cases, such as the regular solutions at the origin. Importantly, we identify novel solutions absent in four-derivative gravity, including those with (double-degenerate) extreme horizons (and their near-horizon limits) that exist without matter sources, which may indicate the existence of regular black holes. We also find asymptotically (anti-)de Sitter spacetimes, giving rise to an effective cosmological constant. The solutions can be classified into six main classes, and, when possible, we provide the description in standard Schwarzschild coordinates, in which they split into thirteen main solution classes.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes: Efficient and Highly Accurate Calculations with Recurrence-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss new recurrence-based methods for calculating the complex frequencies of the quasinormal modes of black holes. These methods are based on the Frobenius series solutions of the differential equation describing the linearized radial perturbations. Within the general method, we propose two approaches: the first involves calculating the series coefficients, while the second employs generalized continued fractions. Moreover, as a consequence of this analysis, we present a computationally efficient and convenient method that uses double convergence acceleration, consisting of the application of the Wynn algorithm to the approximants obtained from the Hill determinants, with the Leaver-Nollert-Zhidenko-like tail approximations taken into account. The latter is particularly important for stabilizing and enabling the calculations of modes with small real parts as well as higher overtones. The method demonstrates exceptionally high accuracy. We emphasize that Gaussian elimination is unnecessary in all of these calculations. We consider $D$-dimensional ($3&lt;D&lt;10$) Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes as concrete examples. Specifically, we calculate the quasinormal modes of the $(2+1)$-dimensional acoustic black hole (which is closely related to the five-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes), the electromagnetic-vector modes of the six-dimensional black holes and the scalar (gravitational tensor) modes in the seven-dimensional case. We believe that the methods presented here are applicable beyond the examples shown, also outside the domain of the black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamically induced spin-2 mass in a Weyl-invariant framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the ghost-free bimetric theory of gravity with the concept of local Weyl invariance, realized in the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. The gravitational sector, characterized by two independent metrics and two independent connections, is coupled to a scalar field that can in principle develop a non-vanishing expectation value through radiative corrections. The spectrum of the model, apart from the massless standard graviton and a pair of axion-like pseudoscalars, associated with the presence of the Holst invariants in the action, includes an additional spin-$2$ state of a non-vanishing Fierz-Pauli mass proportional to the scalar field vacuum expectation value. We analyze the phenomenology of the model and specify the conditions under which the massive spin-$2$ state could be a primary dark matter candidate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that wormholes must be entangled regardless of asymptotic boundary conditions. Assuming black hole complementarity, we argue that traversable wormholes instantiate entanglement-assisted quantum channels and that this entanglement must be present between the stretched horizons as an initial condition prior to traversability. This result demonstrates the forward direction of the ER/EPR conjectures.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of ultralight complex scalar field dark matter and its impact on the growth of structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass window of ultralight axion dark matter motivated by suppressing the growth of structure on subgalactic scales, $m\sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, is now severely constrained by various observation data (e.g. Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). As an attempt to reopen this mass window, we investigate an alternative ultralight dark matter candidate, the complex scalar field dark matter (SFDM). We derive the relativistic hydrodynamics of the complex SFDM in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Our formalism contains two novel ingredients uniquely associated with the complex SFDM model: the Eckart frame defined by the conserved Noether current, and the stiff gauge condition, $c_s^2\equiv (\delta P/\delta\rho)|_s=1$. In the Eckart frame, the complex SFDM is effectively an imperfect fluid with a dissipative energy flux, distinguishing itself from axion dark matter. The energy flux can affect the growth of density fluctuations dynamically. Meanwhile, we apply the stiff gauge condition to find new constitutive equations for the complex SFDM. We revisit the homogeneous evolution of the complex SFDM and present illustrative early-stage solutions for perturbations of the complex SFDM in a simplified setting. We demonstrate the effects of varying the model parameters on the evolution of the perturbation variables.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from slowly spinning neutron stars with DECIGO, Big Bang Observer, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stably rotating highly magnetised neutron stars and glitching pulsars. We discuss the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves from these sources below 20 Hz with next-generation ground-based facilities such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and space-based observatories such as DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We demonstrate that these constitute interesting science targets. We use a robust sensitivity estimation method for future searches based on demonstrated performance. We show that the spin-down upper limit on the gravitational wave amplitude of more than 90% of all highly magnetised pulsars and magnetars suitable for a years-long fully coherent search, exceeds the smallest gravitational wave amplitude estimated detectable with DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We find that the hidden magnetar candidate PSR J1852+0040 can be detected by Cosmic Explorer if it is emitting at least at 20% of its spin-down luminosity. Finally, post-glitch transient continuous gravitational waves from magnetars are an interesting target for deci-Hz detectors, with all but one of the recorded glitches giving rise to a spin-down limit signal above the smallest detectable level.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensors from sub-bundle geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on an arbitrary connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by a generalization of the Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor, which contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the secondary peaks of autocorrelation in black hole flare movies</title>

Abstract: The strong gravitational field of a black hole bends light, forming multi-level images, yet extracting precise spacetime information from them remains challenging. In this study, we investigate how gravitational lensing leaves unique and detectable signatures in black hole movies using autocorrelation analysis. By examining the two-dimensional autocorrelation of a movie depicting a hotspot orbiting a Kerr black hole, as viewed by a near-axis observer, we identify a persistent secondary peak structure induced by gravitational lensing. Notably, these secondary peaks converge to a fixed point in the time-lag domain, largely independent of the hotspot's orbital radius. This key property suggests that combining future black hole flare observations with advanced autocorrelation analysis could effectively disentangle lensing effects from orbital dynamics, enabling direct measurement of black hole parameters. Our findings establish autocorrelation as a powerful tool for probing spacetime geometry, offering new insights into gravitational physics through time-resolved black hole images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that if one solves self-consistently the semiclassical Einstein equations in the presence of a quantum scalar field, with a cutoff on the number of modes, spacetime become flatter when the cutoff increases. Here we extend the result to include the effect of fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1 and 2. With minor adjustments, the main result persists. Remarkably, one can have positive curvature even if the cosmological constant in the bare action is negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole quasinormal modes using the exact WKB method. We perform an analytic continuation from the horizon to infinity along the positive real axis of the radial coordinate and impose appropriate boundary conditions at these asymptotic positions. We clarify the role of previously overlooked logarithmic spirals of Stokes curves and branch cuts emerging from the horizon. We carefully reformulate the derivation of the quasinormal mode conditions using the exact WKB analysis, incorporating the contributions from these features into the calculation. We successfully derive correct results for both solvable model examples and the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our formulation enjoys straightforward extensions to other background geometries as well as a wide range of other physical systems.</description>

      <title>Rapid detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using sparse dictionary learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines for compact binary coalescence based on matched-filtering have reported over 90 confident detections during the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network. Decreasing the latency of detection, in particular for future detectors anticipated to have high detection rates, remains an ongoing effort. In this paper, we develop and test a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm for the rapid detection of GWs. We evaluate the algorithms biases and estimate its GW detection rate for an astrophysical population of binary black holes. The SDL algorithm is assessed using both, simulated data injected into the proposed A+ detector sensitivity and real data containing confident detections from the third LVK observing run. We find that our SDL algorithm can reconstruct a single binary black hole signal in less than 1 s. This suggests that SDL could be regarded as a promising approach for rapid, efficient GW detection in future observing runs of ground-based detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general linear gauge theory, with independent solder form and connection. These spaces have both torsion and nonmetricity. We show that the Cartan structure equations together with the defining equation for nonmetricity allow the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity to be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor. Field redefinitions reduce the structure equations to those of Poincare gauge theory, with local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility. In order to allow recovery the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation and demand integrability of the extended system. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. From this Lorentzian conformal geometry, we establish that the difference between the field strength of special conformal transformations and the torsion and is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

      <title>Particle production rate for a dynamical system using the path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the particle creation rate in a dynamical (Vaidya) spacetime using Feynman's path integral formalism within the framework of the effective action approach. We examine three distinct cases involving the following mass functions, each representing dynamical geometries: (i) $m(v,r)=\mu v$, (ii) $m(v,r)=\mu v +\nu r$, and (iii) $m(v,r)=\mu v -\frac{\mu^2 v^2}{2r}$, where $\mu$ and $\nu$ are positive constants that satisfy all known energy conditions. We analyze particle production rates in the region of dynamical horizons, revealing an initial high rate followed by a rapid decline in all cases. Additionally, we explore the thermodynamic properties by calculating the surface gravity and corresponding Hayward-Kodama temperatures for each scenario. Graphical representations show the variation of surface gravity over time for the three cases, offering insights into the system's thermodynamic evolution. Our research investigates the connection between background geometry and the particle creation process, placing it within the broader context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The non-stationary nature of Vaidya geometry is highlighted as a valuable framework for examining the dynamic aspects of particle creation. This in-depth analysis enhances our understanding of quantum processes in curved spacetime and may offer insights relevant to thermodynamics and studies of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent multidimensional Penrose process driven by magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical observations and numerical simulations are providing increasing evidence that resistive effects in plasmas around black holes play an important role in determining the phenomenology observed from these objects. In this spirit, we present a general approach to the study of a Penrose process driven by plasmoids that are produced at reconnection sites along current sheets. Our formalism is meant to determine the physical conditions that make a plasmoid-driven Penrose process energetically viable and can be applied to scenarios that are matter- or magnetic-field-dominated, that is, in magnetohydrodynamical or force-free descriptions. By exploring reconnection from an axisymmetric but curved surface, our approach can be considered genuinely multidimensional and allows us to explore conditions that are beyond the ones explored so far and that have been restricted to the equatorial plane. Furthermore, it provides a direct contact with numerical simulations of accretion onto black holes, which exhibit an intense reconnection activity outside the equatorial plane. Finally, to describe the kinematics of the plasma self-consistently, we use the well-known configuration of an equilibrium torus with a purely toroidal magnetic field. For such a torus, we discuss the existence of an ``ergobelt'', \ie a nontrivial surface penetrating the ergosphere and acting as a natural a site for the occurrence of reconnection, and from where we estimate the energetics of a plasmoid-driven Penrose process.</description>

Abstract: The conformally invariant scalar equation permits the Robin boundary condition at infinity of asymptotically-AdS spacetimes. We show how the dynamics of conformal cubic scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-anti-de Sitter background depend on the black hole size, charge, and choice of the boundary condition. We study the whole range of admissible charges, including the extremal case. In particular, we observe the transition in stability of the field for large black holes at the specific critical value of the charge. Similarities between Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr black hole let us suspect that a similar effect may also occur in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons, subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical thermodynamics of two-dimensional de Sitter space ($\text{dS}_{2}$) in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled to conformal matter. We extend the quasi-local formalism of Brown and York to $\text{dS}_{2}$, where a timelike boundary is introduced in the static patch to uniquely define conserved charges, including quasi-local energy. The boundary divides the static patch into two systems, a cosmological system and a black hole system, the former being unstable under thermal fluctuations while the latter is stable. A semi-classical quasi-local first law is derived, where the Gibbons--Hawking entropy is replaced by the generalized entropy. In the microcanonical ensemble the generalized entropy is stationary. Further, we show the on-shell Euclidean microcanonical action of a causal diamond in semi-classical JT gravity equals minus the generalized entropy of the diamond, hence extremization of the entropy follows from minimizing the action. Thus, we provide a first principles derivation of the island rule for $U(1)$ symmetric $\text{dS}_{2}$ backgrounds, without invoking the replica trick. We discuss the implications of our findings for static patch de Sitter holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entropy dynamics of de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. The cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime, which limits the causally accessible region for an observer, exhibits thermal properties similar to a black hole event horizon. According to holographic principles, the entropy within a causally connected region is bounded by its surface area. However, this entropy bound is violated during the eternal phase of inflation. To address these violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopt a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. Specifically, we analyze the Shannon entropy of the inflaton field's probability distribution, which mirrors the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-sized region in stochastic inflation. Using the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we demonstrate a significant entropy behavior in de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <title>Signature of hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of the hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers by numerical-relativity simulations with various mass configurations. We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and it collapses into a black hole only in the crossover scenario due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. Identifying these features in a variety of future events with the next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors will enable us to clarify details of hadron-quark transition. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the tree-level single-exchange correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>

      <title>T-duality on Almost Hermitian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to an almost bi-hermitian space with isometry and investigate integrability on its T-dualized one. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized space still admits integrability of the almost complex structures. We also observe that the form of H-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmological expansion on spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium and once more about Olbers' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the impact of the expansion of the Universe on the formation of the total spectral energy density of radiation in the intergalactic medium. Assuming the same proper thermal spectrum of sources, we show how the expansion of the Universe changes the nature of the energy distribution of the thermal spectrum: a decrease of the energy density in the Wien range and an increase in the Rayleigh--Jeans range with increasing the redshift of the bulk filled by sources. This is due to the cosmological redshift and the growing contribution of large number of distant sources. The numerical estimations also illustrate the main factors that resolve the Olbers' paradox in the expanding Universe: i) the particle horizon, ii) the finiteness of the volume filled by luminous objects, and iii) the cosmological redshift. Applying the obtained expressions to the epoch of reionization made it possible to estimate the concentration of objects of various classes (stars, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies) necessary for complete reionization of hydrogen at $z=6$. It is shown that even a small part of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies with a thermal spectrum of moderate temperature, from those predicted by Press-Schechter formalism and its improvements, is able to completely reionize hydrogen in the intergalactic medium at $z=6$.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: Infrared causality and detectability of GW observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-tensor effective field theories of gravity. The scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, being corrections of the lowest orders, can give rise to hairy black holes. By requiring infrared causality, we impose lower bounds on the cutoff scales of the theories. With these bounds, we further discuss the detectability of sGB gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Compared with the gravitational effective field theories that contain only the two tensor modes, adding extra degrees of freedom, such as adding a scalar, opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum chaos from geometric complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that there is a strong interplay between quantum complexity and quantum chaos. In this work, we consider a new method to study geometric complexity for interacting non-Gaussian quantum mechanical systems to benchmark the quantum chaos in a well-known oscillator model. In particular, we study the circuit complexity for the unitary time-evolution operator of a non-Gaussian bosonic quantum mechanical system. Our results indicate that, within some limitations, geometric complexity can indeed be a good indicator of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Dark Photons as a Solution to the GRB 221009A Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of exceptionally high-energy {\gamma}-photons (up to 18 TeV) from GRB 221009A by the LHAASO Collaboration challenges conventional physics. Photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations have been proposed to explain this anomaly, but they rely on specific parameter tuning. We present an alternative explanation involving superluminal dark photons. Building on the frameworks of Markoulakis and Valamontes, we propose that dark photons facilitated faster-than-light (FTL) propagation of information, allowing {\gamma}-photons to bypass extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation. This hypothesis aligns with cosmological observations and experimental results, including those from the LHC, providing a robust framework for addressing the GRB 221009A anomaly.</description>
