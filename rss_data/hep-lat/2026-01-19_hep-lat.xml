      <title>The Spectrum and Scale Setting on 2+1-flavor NME Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the thirteen ensembles, named NME, generated with 2+1-flavor Wilson-clover fermions by the JLab/W\&amp;M/LANL/MIT/Marseille collaborations, and presents an analysis of the meson and baryon spectrum, decay constants $f_\pi$ and $f_K$, flow scales $t_0$ and $w_0$, and time histories of the $\Theta$ and Weinberg operators under gradient flow. Using these quantities, the physical point values of the two flow scales, ${t_0^{\rm Phy}}$ and ${w_0^{\rm Phy}}$, and the ratio $\mathop{f_K / f_\pi}^{\rm Phy}$ are determined. The masses of the octet and decuplet baryons are analyzed using both the next-to-leading order (NLO) and the next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) ansatz from heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HB$\chi$PT). The NNLO fit to the octet baryons, $M_N$, $M_\Sigma$, $M_\Lambda$ and $M_\Xi$, is preferred while the corresponding fits to the decuplet Omega mass, $M_\Omega$, are not distinguished. We also present a study of the autocorrelations in the data and show that there is no evidence, even at large flow time, of the freezing of the topological charge or the Weinberg three-gluon operator.</description>

      <title>Fine-tunings and renormalization of gluino bilinear operators in lattice SYM with Stout-Smeared links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the renormalization factors for the gluino and gluon fields, the gauge parameter, the coupling constant, as well as the scalar, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector gluino bilinear operators in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, using improved lattice actions. Our lattice formulation employs clover fermions, a Symanzik-improved gauge action, and stout-smeared links, which suppress ultraviolet fluctuations and thus enable more accurate determinations of renormalization factors. Our methodology involves computing gauge-variant two-point and three-point Green's functions at one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory, in order to extract the multiplicative renormalization factors and the critical gluino mass. By analyzing lattice discretization effects on the axial current and their dependence on the stout-smearing and clover parameters, we identify a value of the smearing parameter that ensures axial-current conservation at one loop. The results presented in this work provide practical guidance for the fine-tuning procedures required to set up and calibrate lattice simulations of SYM.</description>

      <title>Analytic Bijections for Smooth and Interpretable Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $\phi^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.</description>

      <title>First Nucleon Gluon PDF from Large Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). We focus on the gluon operator which was demonstrated to have the best signal-to-noise in the previous attempt [1] in computing gluon PDFs using LaMET. We compute the corresponding Wilson coefficients needed for the hybrid-renormalized matrix elements and the matching kernel to convert the quasi-PDF to the lightcone one at the one-loop level. We demonstrate that with the proper Wilson coefficients in place, the counterterms for the renormalization are independent of the hadron and mass within statistical error. Using the resulting renormalization, we then compute the nucleon PDF using a HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration with $N_f=2+1+1$, $a \approx 0.12$ fm, with valence pion masses of 310 and 690 MeV and two gauge link smearing techniques. Despite the physics effects of the heavier than physical pion masses and gauge link smearing, this calculation provides excellent proof of principle and compares reasonably with selected global fit results.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity Contribution to the Proton Spin from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, $\Delta G$. The calculation is done on ensembles with three different lattice spacings $a=\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\}$ fm. By employing distillation and momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^\mu$ using 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented by the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^\mu$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $\Delta G$ is found to be $\Delta G = 0.231(17)^{\mathrm{sta.}}(44)^{\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scale ${\mu}^2=10\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(9)\%$ of the proton spin.</description>

      <title>Optimized quantum algorithms for simulating the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model, which describes lattice quantum electrodynamics in $1+1$ space-time dimensions, provides a valuable framework to investigate fundamental aspects of quantum field theory, and a stepping stone towards non-Abelian gauge theories. Specifically, it enables the study of physically relevant dynamical processes, such as the nonperturbative particle-antiparticle pair production, known as the Schwinger effect. In this work, we analyze the quantum computational resource requirements associated with simulating the Schwinger effect under two distinct scenarios: (1) a quench process, where the initial state is a simple product state of a non-interacting theory and then interactions are turned on at time $t=0$, and (2) a splitting (or scattering) process where two Gaussian states, peaked at given initial momenta, are shot away from (or towards) each other. We explore different physical regimes in which the Schwinger effect is expected to be observable. These regimes are characterized by initial momenta and coupling strengths, as well as simulation parameters such as lattice size and electric-field cutoffs. Leveraging known rigorous bounds for electric-field cutoffs, we find that a reliable simulation of the Schwinger effect is provably possible at high cutoff scales. Furthermore, we provide optimized circuit implementations of both the second-order Trotter formula and an interaction-picture algorithm based on the Dyson series to implement the time evolution. Our detailed resource estimates show the regimes in which the interaction-picture approach outperforms the Trotter approach, and vice versa. The improved theoretical error bounds, optimized quantum circuit designs, and explicitly compiled subroutines developed in this study are broadly applicable to simulations of other lattice models in high-energy physics and beyond.</description>
