      <title>New look at Milnor Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S. Donaldson disproved the smooth $\mathrm{h}$-cobordism conjecture in dimension $4$ by studying invariants coming from the moduli space of connections on $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-bundles over smooth $4$-dimension manifolds $X$. In this paper, we reverse his point of view in dimension $8$. Namely, we consider fibrations coming from diffeomorphisms classes of homotopy Hopf manifolds $\Sigma^7\times\mathrm{S}^1$, i.e., $\Sigma^7$ is a homotopy sphere, seeing the bases as moduli spaces for additional structures.
  Our overarching objective is to establish a correspondence between the smooth invariants of Kervaire--Milnor and categorical invariants. One interprets pairwise non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on $\Sigma^7\times\mathrm{S}^1$ in terms of non-rationality. This paper's contributions are diverse, each carrying its significance. We believe profound connections exist between the themes addressed, which connect hypersurface singularity theory, Homological Mirror Symmetry, Topological Modular forms ($\mathrm{tmf}$), and Spherical T-duality.</description>

      <title>On the Schwartz estimate for Hodge Laplacians on semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Schwartz estimates for Hodge Laplacian and Dirac operators on semisimple Lie groups. Alongside, we gives a version of Kuga lemma for its Lie algebra cohomology. This is a generalization of similar results on symmetric spaces. The main purpose of such estimates is to study the heat problem not only in the scalar case, but also for sections of vector bundles on homogeneous spaces using Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of left-invariant metrics on six-dimensional characteristically solvable nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real Lie algebra is said to be characteristically solvable if its derivation algebra is solvable. We explicitly determine the moduli space of left-invariant metrics, up to isometric automorphism, for $6$-dimensional nilmanifolds whose associated Lie algebra is characteristically solvable. We also compute the corresponding full isometry groups. For each left-invariant metric on these nilmanifolds we compute the index and distribution of symmetry. In particular, we find the first known examples of Lie groups which do not admit a left-invariant metric with positive index of symmetry. As an application we study the index of symmetry of nilsoliton metrics on characteristically solvable Lie algebras. We prove that nilsoliton metrics detect the existence of left-invariant metrics with positive index of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss Curvature to the Orlicz Minkowski Problem for q-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem for torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu, Liu and Ma \cite{HJ00} also studied this problem by method of curvature flow and obtain the existence of smooth solution. In addition, the Minkowski problem for $2$-torsional rigidity was also extended to $L_p$ version and Orlicz version.
  Recently, Hu and Zhang \cite{HJ2} introduced the concept of Orlicz mixed $q$-torsional rigidity and obtained Orlicz $q$-torsional measure through the variational method for $q&gt;1$. Specially, they established the functional Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski inequality and the functional Orlicz Minkowski inequality.
  Motivated by the remarkable work by Hu and Zhang in \cite{HJ2}, we can propose the Orlicz Minkowksi problem for $q$-torsional rigidity, and then confirm the existence of smooth even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$ by method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the equatorial concentration of measure phenomenon in the sphere, a result which is deduced from the general, (and intrinsic), concentration of measure in $\mathbb{S}^n(1)$, we describe in this paper an equatorial concentration of measure satisfied by the closed, (compact without boundary), isometric and minimal immersions $x:\Sigma^m \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^n(1)$, ($m \leq n$), and by the minimal Riemannian submersions $\pi: \Sigma^m \rightarrow \mathbb{S}^n(1)$, ($m \geq n$).</description>

      <title>Invariant divisors and equivariant line bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar relative invariants play an important role in the theory of group actions on a manifold as their zero sets are invariant hypersurfaces. Relative invariants are central in many applications, where they often are treated locally since an invariant hypersurface may not be a locus of a single function. Our aim is to establish a global theory of relative invariants.
  For a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of holomorphic vector fields on a complex manifold $M$, any holomorphic $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant hypersurface is given in terms of a $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant divisor. This generalizes the classical notion of scalar relative $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant. Any $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant divisor gives rise to a $\mathfrak{g}$-equivariant line bundle, and a large part of this paper is therefore devoted to the investigation of the group $\mathrm{Pic}_{\mathfrak{g}}(M)$ of $\mathfrak{g}$-equivariant line bundles. We give a cohomological description of $\mathrm{Pic}_{\mathfrak{g}}(M)$ in terms of a double complex interpolating the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for $\mathfrak{g}$ with the \v{C}ech complex of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on $M$.
  We also obtain results about polynomial divisors on affine bundles and jet bundles. This has applications to the theory of differential invariants. Those were actively studied in relation to invariant differential equations, but the description of multipliers (or weights) of relative differential invariants was an open problem. We derive a characterization of them with our general theory. Examples, including projective geometry of curves and second-order ODEs, not only illustrate the developed machinery, but also give another approach and rigorously justify some classical computations. At the end, we briefly discuss generalizations of this theory.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic 3-manifolds with uniform spectral gap for coclosed 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two quantifications of being a homology sphere for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, one geometric and one topological: the spectral gap for the Laplacian on coclosed 1-forms and the size of the first torsion homology group. We first construct a sequence of closed hyperbolic integer homology spheres with volume tending to infinity and a uniform coclosed 1-form spectral gap. This answers a question asked by Lin--Lipnowski. We also find sequences of hyperbolic rational homology spheres with the same properties that geometrically converge to a tame limit manifold. Moreover, we show that any such sequence must have unbounded torsion homology growth. Finally we show that a sequence of closed hyperbolic rational homology 3-spheres with uniformly bounded rank and a uniform coclosed 1-form spectral gap must have torsion homology that grows exponentially in volume.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one)in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>

      <title>Computing distances on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Riemann surfaces are among the simplest and most basic geometric objects. They appear as key players in many branches of physics, mathematics, and other sciences. Despite their widespread significance, how to compute distances between pairs of points on compact Riemann surfaces is surprisingly unknown, unless the surface is a sphere or a torus. This is because on higher-genus surfaces, the distance formula involves an infimum over infinitely many terms, so it cannot be evaluated in practice. Here we derive a computable distance formula for a broad class of Riemann surfaces. The formula reduces the infimum to a minimum over an explicit set consisting of finitely many terms. We also develop a distance computation algorithm, which cannot be expressed as a formula, but which is more computationally efficient on surfaces with high genuses. We illustrate both the formula and the algorithm in application to generalized Bolza surfaces, which are a particular class of highly symmetric compact Riemann surfaces of any genus greater than 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we study Majorana fermions in terms of a modified Chandrasekhar's separation for the Dirac equation in Kerr-Newman-type spacetimes. If the electric charge or magnetic charge is nonzero, we show that nontrivial differentiable time-periodic Majorana fermions do not exist outside the event horizon in Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetimes, and between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Length and torsion dependence of thermal conductivity in twisted graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the physical properties of materials at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of breakthrough nanotechnologies. One of the key properties to consider is the ability to conduct heat, i.e., its thermal conductivity. Graphene is a remarkable nanostructure with exceptional physical properties, including one of the highest thermal conductivities (TC) ever measured. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) share most fundamental properties with graphene, with the added benefit of having a controllable electronic bandgap. One method to achieve such control is by twisting the GNR, which can tailor its electronic properties, as well as change their TC. Here, we revisit the dependence of the TC of twisted GNRs (TGNRs) on the number of applied turns to the GNR by calculating more precise and mathematically well defined geometric parameters related to the TGNR shape, namely, its twist and writhe. We show that the dependence of the TC on twist is not a simple function of the number of turns initially applied to a straight GNR. In fact, we show that the TC of TGNRs requires at least two parameters to be properly described. Our conclusions are supported by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the TC of suspended TGNRs prepared under different values of initially applied turns and different sizes of their suspended part. Among possible choices of parameter pairs, we show that TC can be appropriately described by the initial number of turns and the initial twist density of the TGNRs.</description>

      <title>Exponential localization for eigensections of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic spectral properties of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac 1p\Delta^{L^p\otimes E}+V$ on high tensor powers of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ twisted by a Hermitian vector bundle $E$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ of bounded geometry under assumption that the curvature form of $L$ is non-degenerate. At an arbitrary point $x_0$ of $X$ the operator $H_p$ can be approximated by a model operator $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$, which is a Schr\"odinger operator with constant magnetic field. For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically coincides, up to order $p^{-1/4}$, with the union of the spectra of the model operators $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$ over $X$. We show that, if the union of the spectra of $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$ over the complement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$ in the gap is discrete and the corresponding eigensections decay exponentially away the compact subset.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Quantisation view on the AJ-conjecture for the Teichm\"uller TQFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.11522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a Geometric Quantisation formulation of the AJ-conjecture for the Teichm\"{u}ller TQFT, and we prove it in detail in the case of the knot complements of $4_{1}$ and $5_2$. The conjecture states that the level-$N$ Andersen-Kashaev invariant, $J^{(\mathrm{b},N)}_{M,K}$, is annihilated by the non-homogeneous $\hat{A}$-polynomial, evaluated at appropriate $q$-commutative operators. We obtained the latter via Geometric Quantisation on the moduli space of flat $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-connections on a genus-$1$ surface, by considering the holonomy functions associated to a meridian and longitude. The construction depends on a parameter $\sigma$ in the Teichm\"{u}ller space in a way measured by the Hitchin-Witten connection, but we show that the resulting quantum operators are covariantly constant. Their action on $J^{(\mathrm{b},N)}_{M,K}$ is then defined via a trivialisation of the Hitchin-Witten connection and the Weil-Gel'Fand-Zak transform.</description>

      <title>On clusters and the multi-isoperimetric profile in Riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.14929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a complete Riemannian manifold with bounded geometry, we prove the existence of isoperimetric clusters and also the compactness theorem for sequence of clusters in a larger space obtained by adding finitely many limit manifolds at infinity. Moreover, we show that isoperimetric clusters are bounded. We introduce and prove the Holder continuity of the multi-isoperimetric profile which has been explored by Emanuel Milman and Joe Neeman with a Gaussian-weighted notion of perimeter. We yield a proof of classical existence theorem, e.g. in space forms, for isoperimetric cluster using the results presented here. The results in this work generalize previous works of Stefano Nardulli, Andrea Mondino, Frank Morgan, Matteo Galli and Manuel Ritor\'e from the classical Riemannian and sub-Riemannian isoperimetric problem to the context of Riemannian isoperimetric clusters and also Frank Morgan and Francesco Maggi works on the clusters theory in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript we consider non-degenerate surfaces $\Sigma^2$ immersed in a 3-dimensional homogeneous space $\mathbb{L}^3(\kappa,\tau)$ endowed with two different metrics, the one induced by the Riemannian metric of $\mathbb{E}^3(\kappa,\tau)$ and the non-degenerate metric inherited by the Lorentzian one of $\mathbb{L}^3(\kappa,\tau)$. Therefore, we have two different geometries on $\Sigma^2$ and we can compare them. In particular, we can consider the Gaussian curvature functions which respect to both metrics and study the geometry of the surfaces satisfying that both Gaussian curvature functions are opposite. We will call these surfaces anisocurved surfaces. In order to obtain our main results we also need to impose some extra assumptions regarding the extrinsic curvatures with respect to both metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the 2-category of action Lie groupoids localised in the following three different ways yield equivalent bicategories: localising at equivariant weak equivalences \`a la Pronk, localising using surjective submersive equivariant weak equivalences and anafunctors \`a la Roberts, and localising at all weak equivalences. These constructions generalise the known case of representable orbifold groupoids. We also show that any weak equivalence between action Lie groupoids is isomorphic to the composition of two particularly nice forms of equivariant weak equivalences.</description>

Abstract: For the moduli space of the punctured spheres, we find a new equality between two symplectic forms defined on it. Namely, by treating the elements of this moduli space as the singular Euclidean metrics on a sphere, we give an interpretation of the complex hyperbolic form, i.e. the K\"ahler form of the complex hyperbolic structure on the moduli space, as a kind of Weil-Petersson form.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss Curvature to the orlicz Chord Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $L_p$ chord Minkowski problem based on Chord measures and $L_p$ chord measures introduced firstly by Lutwak, Xi, Yang and Zhang [38] is a very important and meaningful geometric measure problem in the $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski theory. Xi, Yang, Zhang and Zhao [45] using variational methods gave a measure solution when $p &gt; 1$ and $0&lt;p&lt;1$ in the symmetric case. Recently, Guo, Xi and Zhao [18] also obtained a measure solution for $0\leq p&lt;1$ by similar methods without the symmetric assumption.
  In the present paper, we investigate and confirm the orlicz chord Minkowski problem, which generalizes the $L_p$ chord Minkowski problem by replacing $p$ with a fixed continuous function $\varphi:(0,\infty)\rightarrow(0,\infty)$, and achieve the existence of smooth solutions to the orlicz chord Minkowski problem by using methods of Gauss curvature flows.</description>

      <title>On the Multiplicity One Conjecture for Mean Curvature Flows of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Multiplicity One Conjecture for mean curvature flows of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Specifically, we show that any blow-up limit of such mean curvature flows has multiplicity one. This has several applications. First, combining our work with results of Brendle and Choi-Haslhofer-Hershkovits-White, we show that any level set flow starting from an embedded surface diffeomorphic to a 2-spheres does not fatten. In fact, we obtain that the problem of evolving embedded 2-spheres via the mean curvature flow equation is well-posed within a natural class of singular solutions. Second, we use our result to remove an additional condition in recent work of Chodosh-Choi-Mantoulidis-Schulze. This shows that mean curvature flows starting from any generic embedded surface only incur cylindrical or spherical singularities. Third, our approach offers a new regularity theory for solutions of mean curvature flows that flow through singularities. Among other things, this theory also applies to the innermost and outermost flow of any embedded surface and shows that all singularity models of such flows must have multiplicity one. It also establishes equality of the fattening time with the discrepancy time. Lastly, we obtain a number of further results characterizing a separation phenomenon of mean curvature flows of surfaces.</description>

Abstract: The higher order contact of a quadric with a surface in $3$-space at a non-degenerate point is obtained by the Moutard quadric in the Darboux direction. In this paper, we discuss the extension of this result to hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Metrizability of SO(3)-invariant connections: Riemann versus Finsler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a torsion-free affine connection on a given manifold, which does not necessarily arise as the Levi-Civita connection of any pseudo-Riemannian metric, it is still possible that it corresponds in a canonical way to a Finsler structure; this property is known as Finsler (or Berwald-Finsler) metrizability. In the present paper, we clarify, for 4-dimensional SO(3)-invariant, Berwald-Finsler metrizable connections, the issue of the existence of an affinely equivalent pseudo-Riemannian structure. In particular, we find all classes of SO(3)-invariant connections which are not Levi-Civita connections for any pseudo-Riemannian metric - hence, are non-metric in a conventional way - but can still be metrized by SO(3)-invariant Finsler functions. The implications for physics, together with some examples are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Wall crossing for K-moduli spaces of plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct proper good moduli spaces parametrizing K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothable log Fano pairs $(X, cD)$, where $X$ is a Fano variety and $D$ is a rational multiple of the anti-canonical divisor. We then establish a wall-crossing framework of these K-moduli spaces as $c$ varies. The main application in this paper is the case of plane curves of degree $d \geq 4$ as boundary divisors of $\mathbb{P}^2$. In this case, we show that when the coefficient $c$ is small, the K-moduli space of these pairs is isomorphic to the GIT moduli space. We then show that the first wall crossing of these K-moduli spaces are weighted blow-ups of Kirwan type. We also describe all wall crossings for degree 4,5,6, and relate the final K-moduli spaces to Hacking's compactification and the moduli of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Carrollian and celestial spaces at infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the geometry of the asymptotic infinities of Minkowski spacetime (in $d+1$ dimensions) is captured by homogeneous spaces of the Poincar\'e group: the blow-ups of spatial (Spi) and timelike (Ti) infinities in the sense of Ashtekar--Hansen and a novel space Ni fibering over $\mathscr{I}$. We embed these spaces \`a la Penrose--Rindler into a pseudo-euclidean space of signature $(d+1,2)$ as orbits of the same Poincar\'e subgroup of O$(d+1,2)$. We describe the corresponding Klein pairs and determine their Poincar\'e-invariant structures: a carrollian structure on Ti, a pseudo-carrollian structure on Spi and a "doubly-carrollian" structure on Ni. We give additional geometric characterisations of these spaces as grassmannians of affine hyperplanes in Minkowski spacetime: Spi is the (double cover of the) grassmannian of affine lorentzian hyperplanes; Ti is the grassmannian of affine spacelike hyperplanes and Ni fibers over the grassmannian of affine null planes, which is $\mathscr{I}$. We exhibit Ni as the fibred product of $\mathscr{I}$ and the lightcone over the celestial sphere. We also show that Ni is the total space of the bundle of scales of the conformal carrollian structure on $\mathscr{I}$ and show that the symmetry algebra of its doubly-carrollian structure is isomorphic to the symmetry algebra of the conformal carrollian structure on $\mathscr{I}$; that is, the BMS algebra. We show how to reconstruct Minkowski spacetime from any of its asymptotic geometries, by establishing that points in Minkowski spacetime parametrise certain lightcone cuts in the asymptotic geometries. We include an appendix comparing with (A)dS and observe that the de Sitter groups have no homogeneous spaces which could play the r\^ole that the celestial sphere plays in flat space holography.</description>
