      <title>Gaps between Singular Values of Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gaps between consecutive singular values of random rectangular matrices. Specifically, if $M$ is an $n \times p$ random matrix with independent and identically distributed entries and $\Sigma$ is a $n \times n$ deterministic positive definite matrix, then under some technical assumptions we give lower bounds for the gaps between consecutive singular values of $\Sigma^{1/2} M$. As a consequence, we show that sample covariance matrices have simple spectrum with high probability. Our results resolve a conjecture of Vu [{\em Probab. Surv.}, 18:179--200, 2021]. We also discuss some applications, including a bound on the spacings of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of random bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Uniform mean estimation via generic chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an empirical functional $\Psi$ that is an optimal uniform mean estimator: Let $F\subset L_2(\mu)$ be a class of mean zero functions, $u$ is a real valued function, and $X_1,\dots,X_N$ are independent, distributed according to $\mu$. We show that under minimal assumptions, with $\mu^{\otimes N}$ exponentially high probability, \[ \sup_{f\in F} |\Psi(X_1,\dots,X_N,f) - \mathbb{E} u(f(X))| \leq c R(F) \frac{ \mathbb{E} \sup_{f\in F } |G_f| }{\sqrt N}, \] where $(G_f)_{f\in F}$ is the gaussian processes indexed by $F$ and $R(F)$ is an appropriate notion of `diameter' of the class $\{u(f(X)) : f\in F\}$.
  The fact that such a bound is possible is surprising, and it leads to the solution of various key problems in high dimensional probability and high dimensional statistics. The construction is based on combining Talagrand's generic chaining mechanism with optimal mean estimation procedures for a single real-valued random variable.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent on the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.</description>

      <title>Temporal connectivity of Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A temporal random geometric graph is a random geometric graph in which all edges are endowed with a uniformly random time-stamp, representing the time of interaction between vertices. In such graphs, paths with increasing time stamps indicate the propagation of information. We determine a threshold for the existence of monotone increasing paths between all pairs of vertices in temporal random geometric graphs. The results reveal that temporal connectivity appears at a significantly larger edge density than simple connectivity of the underlying random geometric graph. This is in contrast with Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs in which the thresholds for temporal connectivity and simple connectivity are of the same order of magnitude. Our results hold for a family of "soft" random geometric graphs as well as the standard random geometric graph.</description>

      <title>Perimeter length of the convex hull of Brownian motion in the hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the expected hyperbolic length of the perimeter of the convex hull of the trajectory of Brownian motion in the hyperbolic plane to an expectation of a certain exponential functional of a one-dimensional real-valued Brownian motion, and hence derive small- and large-time asymptotics for the expected hyperbolic perimeter. In contrast to the case of Euclidean Brownian motion with non-zero drift, the large-time asymptotics are a factor of two greater than the lower bound implied by the fact that the convex hull includes the hyperbolic line segment from the origin to the endpoint of the hyperbolic Brownian motion. We also obtain an exact expression for the expected perimeter length after an independent exponential random time.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Galton--Watson processes III: Empirical offspring distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforced Galton--Watson processes describe the dynamics of a population where reproduction events are reinforced, in the sense that offspring numbers of forebears can be repeated randomly by descendants. More specifically, the evolution depends on the empirical offspring distribution of each individual along its ancestral lineage. We are interested here in asymptotic properties of the empirical distributions observed in the population, such as concentration, evanescence and persistence. For this, we incorporate tools from the theory of large deviations to our preceding analysis [arXiv:2306.02476,arXiv:2310.19030].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider infinite-dimensional random diffusion dynamics for the Asakura--Oosawa model of interacting hard spheres of two different sizes. We construct a solution to the corresponding SDE with collision local times, analyse its reversible measures, and observe the emergence of an attractive short-range depletion interaction between the large spheres. We study the Gibbs measures associated to this new interaction, exploring connections to percolation and optimal packing.</description>

      <title>Quasi-invariance for SLE welding measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large class of Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere can be encoded by circle homeomorphisms via conformal welding, among which we consider the welding homeomorphism of the random SLE loops and the Weil-Petersson class of quasicircles. It is known from the work of Carfagnini and Wang (arXiv:2311.00209) that the Onsager-Machlup action functional of SLE loop measures - the Loewner energy - coincides with the K\"ahler potential of the unique right-invariant K\"ahler metric on the group of Weil-Petersson circle homeomorphisms. This identity suggests that the group structure given by the composition shall play a prominent role in the law of SLE welding, which is so far little understood.
  In this paper, we show a Cameron-Martin type result for random weldings arising from Gaussian multiplicative chaos, especially the SLE welding measures, with respect to the natural group action by Weil-Petersson circle homeomorphisms. More precisely, we show that these welding measures are quasi-invariant when pre- or post-composing the random welding by a fixed Weil-Petersson circle homeomorphism. Our proof is based on the characterization of the composition action in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on the Cameron-Martin space of the log-correlated Gaussian field and the description of the SLE welding as the welding of two independent Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disks.</description>

      <title>Applications of Random Matrix Theory in Machine Learning and Brain Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain mapping analyzes the wavelengths of brain signals and outputs them in a map, which is then analyzed by a radiologist. Introducing Machine Learning (ML) into the brain mapping process reduces the variable of human error in reading such maps and increases efficiency. A key area of interest is determining the correlation between the functional areas of the brain on a voxel (3-dimensional pixel) wise basis. This leads to determining how a brain is functioning and can be used to detect diseases, disabilities, and sicknesses. As such, random noise presents a challenge in consistently determining the actual signals from the scan. This paper discusses how an algorithm created by Random Matrix Theory (RMT) can be used as a tool for ML, as it detects the correlation of the functional areas of the brain. Random matrices are simulated to represent the voxel signal intensity strength for each time interval where a stimulus is presented in an fMRI scan. Using the Marchenko-Pastur law for Wishart Matrices, a result of RMT, it was found that no matter what type of noise was added to the random matrices, the observed eigenvalue distribution of the Wishart Matrices would converge to the theoretical distribution. This means that RMT is robust and has a high test-re-test reliability. These results further indicate that a strong correlation exists between the eigenvalues, and hence the functional regions of the brain. Any eigenvalue that differs significantly from those predicted from RMT may indicate the discovery of a new discrete brain network.</description>

      <title>Categorical algebra of conditional probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of categorical probability, one uses concepts and techniques from category theory, such as monads and monoidal categories, to study the structures of probability and statistics. In this paper, we connect some ideas from categorical algebra, namely weakly cartesian functors and natural transformations, to the idea of conditioning in probability theory, using Markov categories and probability monads. First of all, we show that under some conditions, the monad associated to a Markov category with conditionals has a weakly cartesian functor and weakly cartesian multiplication (a condition known as Beck-Chevalley, or BC). In particular, we show that this is the case for the Giry monad on standard Borel spaces. We then connect this theory to existing results on statistical experiments. We show that for deterministic statistical experiments, the so-called standard measure construction (which can be seen as a generalization of the "hyper-normalizations" introduced by Jacobs) satisfies a universal property, allowing an equivalent definition which does not rely on the existence of conditionals.</description>

      <title>Stochastic interpretations of the oceanic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how weakening the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis impacts the well-posedness of the stochastic LU primitive equations. The models we consider are intermediate between the incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and the LU primitive equations with standard hydrostatic balance. As such, they are expected to be numerically tractable, while accounting well for phenomena within the grey zone between hydrostatic balance and non-hydrostatic processes. Our main result is the well-posedness of a low-pass filtering-based stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations, with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, in the limit of ``quasi-barotropic'' flow. This assumption is linked to the structure assumption proposed in the work of Agresti et al., which can be related to the dynamical regime where the primitive equations remain valid. Furthermore, we present and study two eddy-(hyper)viscosity-based models.</description>

      <title>Partial and Exact Recovery of a Random Hypergraph from its Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included iid so that the average degree is $n^\delta$. The projection of a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to some hyperedge. The goal is to reconstruct the hypergraph given its projection. An earlier work of Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024) showed that exact recovery for $d=3$ is possible if and only if $\delta &lt; 2/5$. This work completely resolves the question for all values of $d$ for both exact and partial recovery and for both cases of whether multiplicity information about each edge is available or not. In addition, we show that the reconstruction fidelity undergoes an all-or-nothing transition at a threshold. In particular, this resolves all conjectures from Bresler, Guo, and Polyanskiy (COLT 2024).</description>

      <title>Local geometry of high-dimensional mixture models: Effective spectral theory and dynamical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local geometry of empirical risks in high dimensions via the spectral theory of their Hessian and information matrices. We focus on settings where the data, $(Y_\ell)_{\ell =1}^n\in \mathbb R^d$, are i.i.d. draws of a $k$-component Gaussian mixture model, and the loss depends on the projection of the data into a fixed number of vectors, namely $\mathbf{x}^\top Y$, where $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times C}$ are the parameters, and $C$ need not equal $k$. This setting captures a broad class of problems such as classification by one and two-layer networks and regression on multi-index models. We prove exact formulas for the limits of the empirical spectral distribution and outlier eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices in the proportional asymptotics limit, where the number of samples and dimension $n,d\to\infty$ and $n/d=\phi \in (0,\infty)$. These limits depend on the parameters $\mathbf{x}$ only through the summary statistic of the $(C+k)\times (C+k)$ Gram matrix of the parameters and class means, $\mathbf{G} = (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})^\top(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\mu})$. It is known that under general conditions, when $\mathbf{x}$ is trained by stochastic gradient descent, the evolution of these same summary statistics along training converges to the solution of an autonomous system of ODEs, called the effective dynamics. This enables us to connect the spectral theory to the training dynamics. We demonstrate our general results by analyzing the effective spectrum along the effective dynamics in the case of multi-class logistic regression. In this setting, the empirical Hessian and information matrices have substantially different spectra, each with their own static and even dynamical spectral transitions.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Optimal Transport (OTIKIN) -- Part 1: Second-Order Discrepancies Between Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers aimed at constructing a general theory of optimal transport to describe the time evolution of complex systems of interacting particles at the kinetic level. We argue that this theory may have applications also to biology (RNA sequencing and cell development), computer vision (continuous interpolation of images), and engineering (optimal steering).
  Firstly, we define our main object: a new second-order discrepancy between probability measures, analogous to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but based on the minimisation of the squared acceleration.
  Secondly, we prove existence for the associated Kantorovich problem, and, under suitable conditions, of an optimal transport map. We also provide an equivalent time-continuous characterisation (Benamou--Brenier formula), where the admissible curves of measures are solutions to an adapted class of Vlasov's continuity equations.
  Thirdly, we define a class of absolutely continuous curves of measures and prove that they coincide exactly with time reparametrisations of solutions to Vlasov's equations.</description>

      <title>Small Ball Probabilities for the Fractional Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by a Colored Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fractional stochastic heat equation on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d:=\left[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right]^d$, $d\geq 1$, with periodic boundary conditions: \[ \partial_t u(t,\textbf{x})= -(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u(t,\textbf{x})+\sigma(t,\textbf{x},u)\dot{F}(t,\textbf{x})\quad \textbf{x}\in \mathbb{T}^d,t\in\mathbb{R}_+ ,\] where $\alpha\in(1,2]$ and $\dot{F}(t,\textbf{x})$ is a generalized Gaussian noise which is white in time and colored in space. Assuming that $\sigma$ is Lipschitz in $u$ and uniformly bounded, we estimate small ball probabilities for the solution $u$ when $u(0,\textbf{x})\equiv 0$.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for boundary traces of reflected diffusions on uniform domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary trace processes of reflected diffusions on uniform domains. We obtain stable-like heat kernel estimates for such a boundary trace process when the diffusion on the underlying ambient space satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates. Our arguments rely on new results of independent interest such as sharp two-sided estimates and the volume doubling property of the harmonic measure, the existence of a continuous extension of the Na\"im kernel to the topological boundary, and the Doob--Na\"im formula identifying the Dirichlet form of the boundary trace process as the pure-jump Dirichlet form whose jump kernel with respect to the harmonic measure is exactly (the continuous extension of) the Na\"im kernel.</description>

      <title>The Slepian model based independent interval approximation of persistency and zero-level excursion distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physics and engineering literature, the distribution of the excursion time of a stationary Gaussian process has been approximated through a method based on a stationary switch process with independently distributed switching times. The approach matches the covariance of the clipped Gaussian process with that of the stationary switch process. By expressing the switching time distribution as a function of the covariance, the so-called independent interval approximation (IIA) is obtained for the excursions of Gaussian processes. This approach has successfully approximated the persistency coefficient for many vital processes in physics but left an unanswered question about when such an approach leads to a mathematically meaningful and proper excursion distribution. Here, we propose an alternative approximation: the Slepian-based IIA. This approach matches the expected values of the clipped Slepian process and the corresponding switch process initiated at the origin. It is shown that these two approaches are equivalent, and thus, the original question of the mathematical validity of the IIA method can be rephrased using the Slepian model setup. We show that this approach leads to valid approximations of the excursion distribution for a large subclass of the Gaussian processes with monotonic covariance. Within this class, the approximated excursion time distribution has a stochastic representation that connects directly to the covariance of the underlying Gaussian process. This representation is then used to approximate the persistency coefficient for several important processes to illustrate the Slepian-based IIA approach. Lastly, we argue that the ordinary IIA is ill-suited in certain situations, such as for Gaussian processes with a non-monotonic covariance.</description>

Abstract: A Bayesian game is said to have nested information if the players are ordered, and each player knows the types of all players that follow her in that order. We prove that all multiplayer Bayesian games with finite actions spaces, bounded payoffs,Polish type spaces, and nested information admit a Bayesian equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Simulating conditioned diffusions on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To date, most methods for simulating conditioned diffusions are limited to the Euclidean setting. The conditioned process can be constructed using a change of measure known as Doob's $h$-transform. The specific type of conditioning depends on a function $h$ which is typically unknown in closed form. To resolve this, we extend the notion of guided processes to a manifold $M$, where one replaces $h$ by a function based on the heat kernel on $M$. We consider the case of a Brownian motion with drift, constructed using the frame bundle of $M$, conditioned to hit a point $x_T$ at time $T$. We prove equivalence of the laws of the conditioned process and the guided process with a tractable Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequently, we show how one can obtain guided processes on any manifold $N$ that is diffeomorphic to $M$ without assuming knowledge of the heat kernel on $N$. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations of guided processes and Bayesian parameter estimation based on discrete-time observations. For this, we consider both the torus and the Poincar\'e disk.</description>

      <title>Convergence of persistence diagrams for discrete time stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we establish two fundamental results for the sublevel set persistent homology for stationary processes indexed by the positive integers. The first is a strong law of large numbers for the persistence diagram (treated as a measure "above the diagonal" in the extended plane) evaluated on a large class of sets and functions, beyond continuous functions with compact support. We prove this result subject to only minor conditions that the sequence is ergodic and the tails of the marginals are not too heavy. The second result is a central limit theorem for the persistence diagram evaluated on the class of all step functions; this result holds as long as a $\rho$-mixing criterion is satisfied and the distributions of the partial maxima do not decay too slowly. Our results greatly expand those extant in the literature to allow for more fruitful use in statistical applications, beyond idealized settings. Examples of distributions and functions for which the limit theory holds are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the maximum of a reducible two-type branching Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-type reducible branching Brownian motion, defined as a particle system on the real line in which particles of two types move according to independent Brownian motions and create offspring at a constant rate. Particles of type $1$ can give birth to particles of types $1$ and $2$, but particles of type $2$ only give birth to descendants of type $2$. Under some specific conditions, Belloum and Mallein in \cite{BeMa21} showed that the maximum position $M_t$ of all particles alive at time $t$, suitably centered by a deterministic function $m_t$, converge weakly. In this work, we are interested in the decay rate of the following upper large deviation probability, as $t\rightarrow\infty$, \[ {\mathbb P}(M_t\geq \theta m_t),\quad \theta&gt;1. \] We shall show that the decay rate function exhibits phase transitions depending on certain relations between $\theta$, the variance of the underlying Brownian motion and the branching rate.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of asymmetric switch processes with independent switching times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymmetric switch process is a binary stochastic process that alternates between the values one and minus one, where the distributions of the time in these states may differ. Two versions of the process are considered: a non-stationary version that starts with a switch at time zero and a stationary one constructed from the non-stationary one. Characteristics of these two processes, such as the expected values and covariance, are investigated. The main results show an equivalence between the monotonicity of the expected value functions and the distribution of the intervals having a stochastic representation in the form of a sum of random variables, where the number of terms follows a geometric distribution. This representation has a natural interpretation as a model in which switching attempts may fail at random. From these results, conditions are derived when these characteristics lead to valid interval distributions, which is vital in applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The independent interval approximation of the excursion time distributions for Gaussian processes has been used in physics and engineering. A new but related approach matches the expected value of the clipped Slepian to the expected value of a non-stationary binary stochastic process. This approach is extended to non-zero crossings and provides a probabilistic foundation for the validity of the approximations for a large class of processes. Both the above and below distributions are approximated. While the Slepian-based method was shown to be equivalent to the classical IIA for the zero-level, this is not the case for non-zero excursions.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for Statistical Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives a review of concentration inequalities which are widely employed in non-asymptotical analyses of mathematical statistics in a wide range of settings, from distribution-free to distribution-dependent, from sub-Gaussian to sub-exponential, sub-Gamma, and sub-Weibull random variables, and from the mean to the maximum concentration. This review provides results in these settings with some fresh new results. Given the increasing popularity of high-dimensional data and inference, results in the context of high-dimensional linear and Poisson regressions are also provided. We aim to illustrate the concentration inequalities with known constants and to improve existing bounds with sharper constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In R\'enyi's representation for exponential order statistics, we replace the iid exponential sequence with any iid sequence, and call the resulting order statistic generalized R\'enyi statistic. We prove that by randomly reordering the variables in the generalized R\'enyi statistic, we obtain in the limit a sequence of iid exponentials. This result allows us to propose a new model for heavy-tailed data. Although the new model is very close to the classical iid framework, we establish that the Hill estimator is weakly consistent and asymptotically normal without any further assumptions on the underlying distribution or on the number of upper order statistics used in the estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been a go-to algorithm for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems arising in machine learning. Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties. We hereby present a full scope convergence study of biased nonconvex SGD, including weak convergence, function-value convergence and global convergence, and also provide subsequent convergence rates and complexities, all under relatively mild conditions in comparison with literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the horizontal component of the Peano curve has quadratic variation equal the limit of quadratic variations along the Lebesgue partitions for grids of the form $3^{-n}p\Z+3^{-n}r$, $n=1,2,\ldots$, where $p$ is a rational number, while $r$ is irrational number, but the value of such quadratic variation depends on $p$. This also yields that the horizontal component of the Peano curve is an example of a deterministic function possessing local time (density of the occupation measure) with respect to the Lebesgue measure, whose local time can be expressed as the limit of normalized numbers of interval crossings by this function but the normalization is not a smooth function of the width of the interval.</description>
