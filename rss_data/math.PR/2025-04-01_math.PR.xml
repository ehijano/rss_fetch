      <title>Distributional equations and the ruin problem for the Sparre Andersen model with investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is an addendum to the work initiated by Eberlein, Kabanov, and Schmidt and developed further by Kabanov and Promyslov on the asymptotics of the ruin probabilities in the Sparre Andersen model with investments in a risky asset. Using more advanced methods of the implicit renewal theory, we provide complements to some results of the mentioned works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of full replica symmetry breaking (FRSB) for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model at low temperature. More specifically, we verify that the support of the Parisi measure of the SK model contains an interval slightly beyond the high temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Triadic structures in multislice networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks provide a popular representation of complex data. Often, different types of relational measurements are taken on the same subjects. Such data can be represented as a \textit{multislice network}, a collection of networks on the same set of nodes, with connections between the different layers to be determined.
  For the analysis of multislice networks, we take inspiration from the analysis of simple networks, for which small subgraphs (motifs) have proven to be useful; motifs are even seen as building blocks of complex networks. A particular instance of a motif is a triangle, and while triangle counts are well understood for simple network models such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, with i.i.d. distributed edges, even for simple multislice network models little is known about triangle counts.
  Here we address this issue by extending the analysis of triadic structures to multislice Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. Again taking inspiration from the analysis of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, we show that the distribution of triangles across multiple layers in a multislice Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network can be well approximated by an appropriate Poisson distribution. This theoretical result opens the door to statistical goodness of fit tests for multislice networks.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition for a random block matrix model at the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random block matrix model consisting of $D$ random systems arranged along a circle, where each system is modeled by an independent $N\times N$ complex Hermitian Wigner matrix. The neighboring systems interact through an arbitrary deterministic $N\times N$ matrix $A$. In this paper, we extend the localization-delocalization transition of this model, established in arxiv:2312.07297 for the bulk eigenvalue spectrum, to the entire spectrum, including spectral edges. More precisely, let $[E^-,E^+]$ denote the support of the limiting spectrum, and define $\kappa_E:=|E-E^+|\wedge |E-E^-|$ as the distance of an energy $E\in[E^-,E^+]$ from the spectral edges. We prove that for eigenvalues near $E$, a localization-delocalization transition of the corresponding eigenvectors occurs when $\|A\|_{\mathrm{HS}}$ crosses the critical threshold $(\kappa_E+N^{-2/3})^{-1/2}$. Moreover, in the delocalized phase, we show that the extreme eigenvalues asymptotically follow the Tracy-Widom law, while in the localized phase, the edge eigenvalue statistics asymptotically behave like $D$ independent copies of GUE statistics, up to a deterministic shift. Our result recovers the findings of arxiv:2312.07297 in the bulk with $\kappa_E\asymp 1$, and also implies the existence of mobility edges at $E^{\pm}$ when $1\ll \|A\|_{\mathrm{HS}} \ll N^{1/3}$: bulk eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues within $[E^{-}+\varepsilon,E^{+}-\varepsilon]$ are delocalized, whereas edge eigenvectors near $E^{\pm}$ are localized.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for a unidirectional elephant random walk with a power law memory II: Some sharper estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of the unidirectional elephant random walk (uERW) initiated in {\it {Electron. Commun. Probab.}} ({\bf 29} 2024, article no. 78). In this paper we obtain definitive results when the memory exponent $\beta\in (-1, p/(1-p))$. In particular using a coupling argument we obtain the exact asymptotic rate of growth of $S_n$, the location of the uERW at time $n$, for the case $\beta\in (-1, 0] $. Also, for the case $\beta\in (0, p/(1-p))$ we show that $P(S_n \to \infty) \in (0,1)$ and conditional on $\{S_n \to \infty\}$ we obtain the exact asymptotic rate of growth of $S_n$. In addition we obtain the central limit theorem for $S_n$ when $\beta \in (-1, p/(1-p))$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative approximation to density dependent SDEs driven by $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a class of moderately interacting particle systems, we establish a quantitative approximation for density-dependent McKean-Vlasov SDEs and the corresponding nonlinear, nonlocal PDEs. The SDE is driven by both Brownian motion and pure-jump L\'evy processes. By employing Duhamel's formula, density estimates, and appropriate martingale functional inequalities, we derive precise convergence rates for the empirical measure of particle systems toward the law of the McKean-Vlasov SDE solution. Additionally, we quantify both weak and pathwise convergence between the one-marginal particle and the solution to the McKean-Vlasov SDE. Notably, all convergence rates remain independent of the noise type.</description>

      <title>A remark on elephant random walks via the classical law of the iterated logarithm for self-similar Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main concern of this paper is to investigate the problem whether two Elephant Random Walks (ERWs) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with different memory parameters can meet each other infinitely often, extending the result by Roy, Takei, and Tanemura. We also study the asymptotic behavior of the distance between them by providing an elementary and accessible proof of the classical Law of Iterated Logarithm (LIL) for centered continuous self-similar Gaussian processes under a certain decay condition on the covariance kernel.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we provide sufficient conditions for sequences of stochastic processes of the form $\int_{[0,t]} f_n(u) \theta_n(u) du$, to weakly converge, in the space of continuous functions over a closed interval, to integrals with respect to the Brownian motion, $\int_{[0,t]} f(u)W(du)$, where $\{f_n\}_n$ is a sequence satisfying some integrability conditions converging to $f$ and $\{\theta_n\}_n$ is a sequence of stochastic processes whose integrals $\int_{[0,t]}\theta_n(u)du$ converge in law to the Brownian motion (in the sense of the finite dimensional distribution convergence), in the multidimensional parameter set case.</description>

      <title>Decoupling and decay of two-point functions in a two-species TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a translation-invariant stationary measure as the initial condition. We establish the asymptotic decoupling of the marginal height profiles along characteristic lines and prove the decay of the two-point functions in the large-time limit, thus confirming predictions of the nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics theory. Our approach builds on the queueing construction of the stationary measure introduced in [Angel'06, Ferrari-Martin'07] and extends the theory of backwards paths for height functions developed in [Bufetov-Ferrari'22, Ferrari-Nejjar'24]. The arguments for asymptotic decoupling also apply to further homogeneous initial data.</description>

      <title>Universal KPZ Fluctuations for Moderate Deviations of Random Walks in Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of diffusion seeks to describe the motion of particles in a chaotic environment. Classical theory models individual particles as independent random walkers, effectively forgetting that particles evolve together in the same environment. Random Walks in a Random Environment (RWRE) models treat the environment as a random space-time field that biases the motion of particles based on where they are in the environment. We provide a universality result for the moderate deviations of the transition probability of this model over a wide class of choices of random environments. In particular, we show the convergence of moments to those of the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation (SHE), whose logarithm is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The environment only filters into the scaling limit through one parameter, which depends explicitly on the statistical description of the environment. This forms the basis for our introduction, in arXiv:2406.17733, of the extreme diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Wall-crossing phenomenon for the liquid bin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the liquid bin model as a continuous-time deterministic dynamics, arising as the hydrodynamic limit of a discrete-time stochastic interacting particle system called the infinite bin model. For the liquid bin model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary evolution, to which the dynamics converges exponentially fast. The speed of the front of the system is explicitly computed as a continuous piecewise rational function of the parameters of the model, revealing an underlying wall-crossing phenomenon. We show that the regions on which the speed is rational are of non-empty interior and are naturally indexed by Dyck paths. We provide a complete description of the adjacency structure of these regions, which generalizes the Stanley lattice for Dyck paths. Finally we point out an intriguing connection to the topic of extensions of partial cyclic orders to total cyclic orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of local and global in time weak martingale solutions for a stochastic version of the Othmer-Dunbar-Alt kinetic model of chemotaxis under suitable assumptions on the turning kernel and stochastic drift coefficients, using dispersion and stochastic Strichartz estimates. The analysis is based on new Strichartz estimates for stochastic kinetic transport. The derivation of these estimates involves a local in time dispersion analysis using properties of stochastic flows, and a time-splitting argument to extend the local in time results to arbitrary time intervals.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Assortativity on Mpox Spreading with Two Core Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of infectious diseases often concentrates within specific subgroups of a broader population. For instance, during recent mpox outbreaks in non-endemic countries, transmission primarily affected men who have sex with men (MSM). However, the internal structure of these subpopulations plays a crucial role in disease dynamics and should be accurately represented in mathematical models. In this study, we highlight the importance of modeling interactions between distinct subgroups and their impact on transmission patterns. We consider a stochastic SEIR-based model with two core groups embedded into the general population, and investigate the outcome of the outbreak with different levels of symmetry between these groups and assortativity in their contacts. Our results indicate that the efficiency of commonly used non-pharmaceutical interventions is greatly influenced by these factors, hence they should be considered in the design of intervention strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the so-called weak Pinsker dynamical filtrations, whose existence in any ergodic system follows from the universality of the weak Pinsker property, recently proved by Austin. These dynamical filtrations appear as a potential tool to describe and classify positive entropy systems. We explore the links between the asymptotic structure of weak Pinsker filtrations and the properties of the underlying dynamical system. A central question is whether, on a given system, the structure of weak Pinsker filtrations is unique up to isomorphism. We give a partial answer, in the case where the underlying system is Bernoulli. We conclude our work by giving two explicit examples of weak Pinsker filtrations.</description>

      <title>Almost sure asymptotics for the number variance of dilations of integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of integers. We study the number variance of dilations $(\alpha x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ modulo 1 in intervals of length $S$, and establish pseudorandom (Poissonian) behavior for Lebesgue-almost all $\alpha$ throughout a large range of $S$, subject to certain regularity assumptions imposed upon $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$. For the important special case $x_n = p(n)$, where $p$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree at least 2, we prove that the number variance is Poissonian for almost all $\alpha$ throughout the range $0 \leq S \leq (\log N)^{-c}$, for a suitable absolute constant $c&gt;0$. For more general sequences $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$, we give a criterion for Poissonian behavior for generic $\alpha$ which is formulated in terms of the additive energy of the finite truncations $(x_n)_{n=1}^N$.</description>

      <title>Bounding Escape Rates and Approximating Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Brownian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout physics Brownian dynamics are used to describe the behaviour of molecular systems. When the Brownian particle is confined to a bounded domain, a particularly important question arises around determining how long it takes the particle to encounter certain regions of the boundary from which it can escape. Termed the first passage time, it sets the natural timescale of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that are described by the stochastic differential equation. Probabilistic information about the first passage time can be studied using spectral properties of the deterministic generator of the stochastic process. In this work we introduce a framework for bounding the leading eigenvalue of the generator which determines the exponential rate of escape of the particle from the domain. The method employs sum-of-squares programming to produce nearly sharp numerical upper and lower bounds on the leading eigenvalue, while also giving good numerical approximations of the associated leading eigenfunction, the quasi-stationary distribution of the process. To demonstrate utility, the method is applied to prototypical low-dimensional problems from the literature.</description>

Our main results capture the 'leading term' in the difference between this distribution and the 'independent hypergraph model', where (in the case $H = K_r$) each copy is present independently with probability $\pi = p^{\binom{r}{2}}$. As a concrete application, we derive a new upper bound on the number of $K_r$-factors in $G(n,p)$ above the threshold for such factors to appear.
  We will prove our main results in a much more general setting, so that they also apply to random hypergraphs, and also (for example) to the case when $p$ is constant and $r = r(n) \sim 2\log_{1/p}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Dense networks of integrate-and-fire neurons: Spatially-extended mean-field limit of the empirical measure</title>

Abstract: The dynamics of spatially-structured networks of $N$ interacting stochastic neurons can be described by deterministic population equations in the mean-field limit. While this is known, a general question has remained unanswered: does synaptic weight scaling suffices, by itself, to guarantee the convergence of network dynamics to a deterministic population equation, even when networks are not assumed to be homogeneous or spatially structured? In this work, we consider networks of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons with arbitrary synaptic weights satisfying a $O(1/N)$ scaling condition. Borrowing results from the theory of dense graph limits, or graphons, we prove that, as $N\to\infty$, and up to the extraction of a subsequence, the empirical measure of the neurons' membrane potentials converges to the solution of a spatially-extended mean-field partial differential equation (PDE). Our proof requires analytical techniques that go beyond standard propagation of chaos methods. In particular, we introduce a weak metric that depends on the dense graph limit kernel and we show how the weak convergence of the initial data can be obtained by propagating the regularity of the limit kernel along the dual-backward equation associated with the spatially-extended mean-field PDE. Overall, this result invites us to reinterpret spatially-extended population equations as universal mean-field limits of networks of neurons with $O(1/N)$ synaptic weight scaling.</description>

      <title>Optimizing over iid distributions and the Beat the Average game</title>

Abstract: A casino offers the following game. There are three cups each containing a die. You are being told that the dice in the cups are all the same, but possibly nonstandard. For a bet of \$1, the game master shakes all three cups and lets you choose one of them. You win \$2 if the die in your cup displays at least the average of the other two, and you lose otherwise. Is this game in your favor? If not, how should the casino design the dice to maximize their profit?
  This problem is a special case of the following more general question: given a measurable space $X$ and a bounded measurable function $f : X^n \to \R$, how large can the expectation of $f$ under probability measures of the form $\mu^{\otimes n}$ be? We develop a general method to answer this kind of question. As an example application that is harder than the casino problem, we show that the maximal probability of the event $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 &lt; 2 X_4$ for nonnegative iid random variables lies between $0.400695$ and $0.417$, where the upper bound is obtained by mixed integer linear programming. We conjecture the lower bound to be the exact value.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chaos Inequalities and Chaos of Combinatorial Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix concentration inequalities and their recently discovered sharp counterparts provide powerful tools to bound the spectrum of random matrices whose entries are linear functions of independent random variables. However, in many applications in theoretical computer science and in other areas one encounters more general random matrix models, called matrix chaoses, whose entries are polynomials of independent random variables. Such models have often been studied on a case-by-case basis using ad-hoc methods that can yield suboptimal dimensional factors.
  In this paper we provide general matrix concentration inequalities for matrix chaoses, which enable the treatment of such models in a systematic manner. These inequalities are expressed in terms of flattenings of the coefficients of the matrix chaos. We further identify a special family of matrix chaoses of combinatorial type for which the flattening parameters can be computed mechanically by a simple rule. This allows us to provide a unified treatment of and improved bounds for matrix chaoses that arise in a variety of applications, including graph matrices, Khatri-Rao matrices, and matrices that arise in average case analysis of the sum-of-squares hierarchy.</description>

      <title>CLT for LES of correlated Non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices such that the $ij$th entry of one matrix is correlated with the $ij$th entry of the other matrix. However, the entries of any particular matrix are i.i.d. random variables. We study the asymptotic behavior of the combined spectrum, and the limit of the linear eigenvalue statistic defined on the combined spectrum. We show that if the random variables are centered with variance $1/n$ and having finite moments, then the centered \textit{Linear Eigenvalue Statistics} (LESs) converge jointly to a bivariate Gaussian distribution. We assumed that the test function used in the LES belongs to Sobolev $H^{2+\delta}$ space. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution depends on correlation structure of the matrix entries and the fourth order mixed cumulants of the matrix entries. This generalizes the previous results by Rider, Silverstein (2006), Cipolloni, Erd\H{o}s, Schr\"oder (2023). In particular, we obtain the limiting LES of random centrosymmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-potential game framework for $N$-player dynamic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16962v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic $N$-player non-cooperative games called $\alpha$-potential games, where the change of a player's value function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an $\alpha$-potential function up to an error $\alpha$. Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$), the $\alpha$-potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding $\alpha$-Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the $\alpha$-potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of $\alpha$-potential functions is established, with $\alpha$ represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of value functions' second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, $\alpha$ is characterized in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions and the level of heterogeneity among players. Two classes of stochastic differential games, namely distributed games and games with mean field interactions, are analyzed to highlight the dependence of $\alpha$ on general game characteristics that are beyond the mean-field paradigm, which focuses on the limit of $N$ with homogeneous players. To analyze the $\alpha$-NE, the associated optimization problem is embedded into a conditional McKean-Vlasov control problem. A verification theorem is established to construct $\alpha$-NE based on solutions to an infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations for linear-quadratic games.</description>

      <title>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the BPHZ renormalisation via multi-indices, a combinatorial structure extremely succesful for describing scalar valued singular SPDEs. We propose the multi-indices counterpart of the Hopf algebraic program initiated by Connes and Kreimer on the renormalisation of Feynman diagrams. The construction relies on a well-chosen extraction-contraction coproduct of multi-indices equipped with a correct symmetry factor. We illustrate our construction on the renormalisation of the $ \Phi^4 $ measure.</description>

      <title>A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with random search directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic coordinate descent algorithms are efficient methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most coordinates at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining coordinates. However, this approach is usually restricted to canonical basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we develop a new class of stochastic gradient descent algorithms with random search directions which uses the directional derivative of the gradient estimate following more general random vectors. We establish the almost sure convergence of these algorithms with decreasing step. We further investigate their central limit theorem and pay particular attention to analyze the impact of the search distributions on the asymptotic covariance matrix. We also provide non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>
