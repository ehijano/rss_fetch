      <title>Bottomonium Properties in QGP from a Lattice-QCD Informed T-Matrix Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) computations of bottomonium correlation functions with extended sources provide new insights into heavy-quark dynamics at distance scales which are of the order of the inverse temperature. We analyze these results employing the thermodynamic T-matrix approach, in a continued effort to interpret lQCD data for quarkonium correlation functions in a non-perturbative framework suitable for strongly coupled systems. Its key inputs are the in-medium driving kernel (potential) of the scattering equation and an interference function which implements 3-body effects in the quarkonium coupling to the thermal medium. A simultaneous description of lQCD results for the bottomonium correlators with extended operators and the previously analyzed Wilson line correlators only requires minor refinements of the potential but calls for stronger interference effects at larger separation of the bottom quark and antiquark. We then analyze the poles of the self-consistent T-matrices on the real axis to assess the survival of the various bound states. We estimate the pertinent temperatures where the poles disappear for the various bottomonium states and discuss the relation to the corresponding peaks in the bottomonium spectral functions. We also recalculate the spatial diffusion coefficient of the QGP and find it to be similar to that in our previous study.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave asteroseismology of neutron stars with unified EOS: on the role of high-order nuclear empirical parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the sensitivity of non-radial fluid oscillation modes and tidal deformations in neutron stars to high-order nuclear empirical parameters (NEP). In particular, we study the impact of the curvature and skewness of the symmetry energy $K_{\rm sym}$, $Q_{\rm sym}$, and the skewness of the binding energy in symmetric nuclear matter $Q_{\rm sat}$. As we are interested in the possibility of gravitational wave detection by future interferometers, we consider that the tidal interaction is the driving force for the quadrupolar non-radial fluid oscillations. We have also studied the correlations between those quantities, which will be useful to understand the strong physics of gravitational wave phenomena. Our main results show that $K_{\rm sym}$ impacts the frequencies of the fundamental mode mainly for low-mass neutron stars. The NEP $Q_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$ affect the fundamental modes of intermediate and heavy neutron stars, respectively. In the case of the first pressure mode, $K_{\rm sym}$ shows a small effect, while $Q_{\rm sat}$ shows a considerable decrease in this oscillation mode independent of the neutron star mass. Similarly, for tidal deformability, the NEP $Q_{\rm sat}$ and $Q_{\rm sym}$ show a bigger impact than $K_{\rm sym}$. Given the impact of the NEP on gravitational wave phenomena and the currently large uncertainties of these parameters, the prospect of higher sensitivity in future gravitational wave detectors promise a possible new tool to constrain high-order NEP.</description>

      <title>Fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. We then engineer a fermionic color code which corrects for both phase and loss errors. We show how to realize a universal fermionic gate set in this code, including transversal Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we realize qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for simulating fermions. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates by introducing a neutral-atom braiding gate using photodissociation of bosonic molecules. As an application, we consider the fermionic fast Fourier transform, an important subroutine for simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ and a linear improvement from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ in Clifford gate complexity compared to state-of-the-art qubit-only approaches. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Nuclear correlation functions using first-principle calculations of lattice quantum chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring nuclear physics through the fundamental constituents of the strong force -- quarks and gluons -- is a formidable challenge. While numerical calculations using lattice quantum chromodynamics offer the most promising approach for this pursuit, practical implementation is arduous, especially due to the uncontrollable growth of quark-combinatorics, the so-called Wick-contraction problem of nuclei. We present here two novel methods providing a state-of-the-art solution to this problem. In the first, we exploit randomized algorithms inspired from computational number theory to detect and eliminate redundancies that arise in Wick contraction computations. Our second method explores facilities for automation of tensor computations -- in terms of efficient utilization of specialized hardware, algorithmic optimizations, as well as ease of programming and the potential for automatic code generation -- that are offered by new programming models inspired by applications in machine learning (e.g., TensorFlow). We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by computing two-point correlation functions for Deuteron, Helium-3, Helium-4 and Lithium-7, achieving at least an order of magnitude improvement over existing algorithms with efficient implementation on GPU-accelerators. Additionally, we discover an intriguing characteristic shared by all the nuclei we study: specific spin-color combinations dominate the correlation functions, hinting at a potential connection to an as-yet-unidentified symmetry in nuclei. Moreover finding them beforehand can reduce the computing time further and substantially. Our results, with the efficiency that we achieved, suggest the possibility of extending the applicability of our methods for calculating properties of light nuclei, potentially up to A ~12 and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quark Star Mergers: The Equation of State of Decompressed Quark Matter and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark stars are challenging to confirm or exclude observationally because they can have similar masses and radii as neutron stars. By performing the first calculation of the non-equilibrium equation of state of decompressed quark matter at finite temperature, we determine the properties of the ejecta from binary quark-star or quark star-black hole mergers. We account for all relevant physical processes during the ejecta evolution, including quark nugget evaporation and cooling, and weak interactions. We find that these merger ejecta can differ significantly from those in neutron star mergers, depending on the binding energy of quark matter. For relatively high binding energies, quark star mergers are unlikely to produce r-process elements and kilonova signals. We propose that future observations of binary mergers and kilonovae could impose stringent constraints on the binding energy of quark matter and the existence of quark stars.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD Critical End Point with Finite-Size Scaling of Net-Baryon Cumulant Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) critical end point (CEP) is a central focus in heavy-ion physics, as it provides insights into the phase structure of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. Finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis is applied to explore the critical behavior of cumulant ratios \( C_2/C_1 \), \( C_3/C_2 \), \( C_4/C_2 \), \( C_3/C_1 \), and \( C_4/C_1 \), measured in Au+Au collisions across the Beam Energy Scan (BES) range of 7.7 to 200 GeV. The scaling functions for these ratios reveal non-monotonic patterns near the CEP, where critical fluctuations appear in distinct scaling behavior. A consistent scaling pattern emerges at \(\sqrt{s}_{\text{CEP}} = 31.0 \, \text{GeV}\), corresponding to \( \mu_{B,\text{CEP}} \approx 134.3 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( T_{\text{CEP}} \approx 155 \, \text{MeV}\), derived from the freeze-out curve. The FSS analysis shows upward divergence of \( C_2/C_1 \) and \( C_4/C_1 \), and downward divergence of \( C_3/C_2 \) and \( C_4/C_2 \), consistent with theoretical expectations for critical dynamics. These findings validate the robustness of these cumulant ratios as probes for the CEP, offering structured evidence for critical behavior in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Observation of partonic flow in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics predicts a phase transition from ordinary hadronic matter to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at high temperatures and energy densities, where quarks and gluons (partons) are not confined within hadrons. The QGP is generated in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Anisotropic flow coefficients, quantifying the anisotropic azimuthal expansion of the produced matter, provide a unique tool to unravel QGP properties. Flow measurements in high-energy heavy-ion collisions show a distinctive grouping of anisotropic flow for baryons and mesons at intermediate transverse momentum, a feature associated with flow being imparted at the quark level, confirming the existence of the QGP. The observation of QGP-like features in relativistic proton-proton and proton-ion collisions has sparked debate about possible QGP formation in smaller collision systems, which remains unresolved. In this article, we demonstrate for the first time the distinctive grouping of anisotropic flow for baryons and mesons in high-multiplicity proton-lead and proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These results are described by a model that includes hydrodynamic flow followed by hadron formation via quark coalescence, replicating features observed in heavy-ion collisions. This observation is consistent with the formation of a partonic flowing system in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>The Three-Point Energy Correlator in the Coplanar Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators are a type of observables that measure how energy is distributed across multiple detectors as a function of the angles between pairs of detectors. In this paper, we study the three-point energy correlator (EEEC) at lepton colliders in the three-particle near-to-plane (coplanar) limit. The leading-power contribution in this limit is governed by the three-jet (trijet) configuration. We introduce a new approach by projecting the EEEC onto the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the unit vectors aligned with three detected final-state particles. Analogous to the back-to-back limit of the two-point energy correlator probing the dijet configuration, the small-volume limit of the EEEC probes the trijet configuration. We derive a transverse momentum dependent (TMD) based factorization theorem that captures the soft and collinear logarithms in the coplanar limit, which enables us to achieve the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithm (N$^3$LL) resummation. To our knowledge, this is the first N$^3$LL result for a trijet event shape. Additionally, we demonstrate that a similar factorization theorem can be applied to the fully differential EEEC in the three-particle coplanar limit, which provides a clean environment for studying different coplanar trijet shapes.</description>

      <title>The lowest-radiation environments in the Solar System: new opportunities for underground rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino, muon, and gamma-ray fluxes in extraterrestrial environments in our Solar System via semi-analytical estimates and Monte Carlo simulations. In sites with negligible atmosphere, we find a strong reduction in the cosmic-ray-induced neutrino and muon fluxes relative to their intensities on Earth. Neutrinos with energies between 50 MeV and 100 TeV show particularly strong suppression, by as much as 10$^3$, even at shallow depths. The solar neutrino suppression increases as the square of the site's distance from the Sun. Natural radiation due to nuclear decay is also expected to be lower in many of these locations and may be reduced to effectively negligible levels in the liquid water environments. The sites satisfying these characteristics represent an opportunity for greatly extending the physics reach of underground searches in fundamental physics, such as searches for WIMP Dark Matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, the diffuse supernova neutrinos, and neutrinos from nearby supernova. As a potential near-term target, we propose a measurement of muon and gamma-ray fluxes in an accessible underground lunar site such as the Mare Tranquillitatis Pit to perform a first measurement of the prompt component in cosmic-ray-induced particle production, and to constrain lunar evolution models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present quantitative predictions for the nuclear modification factor in both small and peripheral systems from an energy loss model that is constrained by light- and heavy-flavor suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions. We find nearly identical suppression for central $p / d + A$ collisions as for peripheral $A + A$ collisions, quantitatively consistent with the measured 20% suppression of neutral pions produced in $d + \mathrm{Au}$ collisions by PHENIX but dramatically inconsistent with the measured 20% enhancement of charged hadrons produced in $p + \mathrm{Pb}$ collisions by ATLAS. We demonstrate that this equivalence of central small system suppression and peripheral large system suppression is insensitive to the underlying energy loss model.</description>

      <title>Effect of invisible neutrino decay on the neutrino oscillation at long-baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effect of invisible neutrino decay of the third neutrino state for accelerator neutrino experiments at two different baselines, 1300 km with a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector (similar to DUNE) and 2588 km with a water Cherenkov detector (similar to P2O). For such baselines, the matter effect starts to become important. Our aim is to ascertain the sensitivity to mass hierarchy and octant of $\theta_{23}$ in these two experiments in the presence of a decaying neutrino state. We compare and contrast the results of the two experimental setups. We find that, in general, hierarchy sensitivity decreases in the presence of decay. However, if we consider decay only in the opposite hierarchy (test scenario), in the 2588 km setup, the hierarchy sensitivity with the true hierarchy as IH is larger than the no decay case. We also study the dependence of hierarchy sensitivity with true $\theta_{23}$. We find that the dominant muon background in P2O plays an important role in how the hierarchy sensitivity depends on $\theta_{23}$. The octant sensitivity for both setups increases in the presence of decay except for the LArTPC setup in case true $\theta_{23}=49^\circ$. To understand the octant sensitivity results in the two setups, we check the synergy in sensitivity between electron and muon channels as a function of test $\theta_{23}$. We also study the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane and find that combined analysis of the two setups removes all the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane at $5\sigma$ significance.</description>

      <title>Reggeization in Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the high energy limit, $s\gg -t$, amplitudes in planar gauge theories Reggeize, with power law behavior $\big( \frac{s}{-t} \big)^{\alpha(t)}$ governed by the Regge trajectory $\alpha(t)$. Beyond the planar limit this simplicity is violated by "Regge cuts", for which practical organizational principles are still being developed. We use a top-down effective field theory organization based on color projection in the $t$ channel and rapidity evolution equations for collinear impact factors, to sum large $s\gg -t$ logarithms for Regge cut contributions. The results are matrix equations which are closed within a given color channel. To illustrate the method we derive in QCD with $SU(N_c)$ for the first time a closed 6$\times$6 evolution equation for the "decupletons" in the $\text{10}\oplus\overline{\text{10}}$ Regge color channel, a 2$\times$2 evolution equation for the "triantapentons" in the $\text{35}\oplus\overline{\text{35}}$ color channel, and a scalar evolution equation for the "tetrahexaconton" in the 64 color channel. More broadly, our approach allows us to describe generic Reggeization phenomena in non-planar gauge theories, providing valuable data for the all loop structure of amplitudes beyond the planar limit.</description>

      <title>Gapless non-hydrodynamic modes in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide rigorous criteria to determine whether the non-hydrodynamic sector of a relativistic kinetic theory is gapless. These general criteria apply to both Boltzmann's equation and approximate models thereof, provided that the latter are consistent with thermodynamic principles. As an application of these criteria, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapless whenever the scattering cross-section decays to zero at large energies. Physically, this happens because, if particles with very high energy (compared to the temperature) are free streaming, we can use them to build hot non-hydrodynamic waves, which live longer than any hydrodynamic wave. Since many standard cross-sections in quantum field theory vanish at high energies, the existence of these non-thermal long-lived waves is a rather general feature of relativistic systems.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Level Density and $\gamma$-ray Strength Function of $^{67}\mathrm{Ni}$ and the impact on the i-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton-$\gamma$ coincidences from $(\mathrm{d},\mathrm{p})$ reactions between a $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}$ beam and a deuterated polyethylene target have been analyzed with the inverse-Oslo method to find the nuclear level density (NLD) and $\gamma$-ray strength function ($\gamma$SF) of $^{67}\mathrm{Ni}$. The $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(n,\gamma)$ capture cross section has been calculated using the Hauser-Feshbach model in TALYS using the measured NLD and $\gamma$SF as constraints. The results confirm that the $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(n,\gamma)$ reaction acts as a bottleneck when relying on one-zone nucleosynthesis calculations. However, the impact of this reaction is strongly dampened in multi-zone models of low-metallicity AGB stars experiencing i-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark mass near the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Effective theory tower for $\mu\rightarrow e$ conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions for $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion rates using a tower of effective field theories connecting the UV to nuclear physics scales. The interactions in nuclei are described using a recently developed nonrelativistic effective theory (NRET) that organizes contributions according to bound nucleon and muon velocities, $\vec{v}_N$ and $\vec{v}_\mu$, with $|\vec{v}_N| &gt; |\vec{v}_\mu|$. To facilitate the top-down matching, we enlarge the set of Lorentz covariant nucleon-level interactions mapped onto the NRET operators to include those mediated by tensor interactions, in addition to the scalar and vector interactions already considered previously, and then match NRET nonperturbatively onto the Weak Effective Theory (WET). At the scale $\mu \approx 2$ GeV WET is formulated in terms of $u$, $d$, $s$ quarks, gluons and photons as the light degrees of freedom, along with the flavor-violating leptonic current. We retain contributions from WET operators up to dimension 7, which requires the full set of 26 NRET operators. The results are encoded in the open-source Python- and Mathematica-based software suite MuonBridge, which we make available to the theoretical and experimental communities interested in $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion.</description>

      <title>On the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.</description>

      <title>New Tool to Detect Inhomogeneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we discuss a novel method to search for inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in theories with fermions. The prime application we have in mind is QCD, but the method is also applicable for other theories including solid state applications. It is based on an extension of the chiral susceptibility to inhomogeneous phases and it works as a stability analysis. Our method allows us to determine when homogeneous solutions have the tendency to create spatially modulated condensates. As proof of principle, we apply this technique to a rainbow-ladder QCD model and confirm the conjectured shape of the instability region published in Ref. [1].</description>

      <title>The time evolution of light nuclei cumulants and ratios with a first-order phase transition in the UrQMD transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UrQMD model with a density dependent equation of state, including a first-order phase transition, is used to study the time dependence of baryon number and proton number susceptibilities up to third order in heavy ion reactions of $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=2-3 A$ GeV. A significant deviation from the Gaussian fluctuations of the baryon number fluctuation in coordinate space is observed. The proton number fluctuations are always suppressed as they constitute only a small fraction of the total baryon number during the dense phase of the collision. It is found that the only measurable, but small, signal would be an enhancement of the third order (or higher) proton cumulant in a finite rapidity window $\Delta y$ that is larger than one unit of rapidity. In addition, it is found that the coordinate fluctuations will lead to an enhancement of cluster production due to the correlations in coordinate space. However, this enhancement is small and mainly occurs during the dense part of the collision before the system actually freezes out.</description>
