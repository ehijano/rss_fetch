      <title>Nano-size fragmentation of Tantalum in Copper composite using additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biggest challenge in manufacturing an immiscible system is phase segregation and non-uniformity inside the composite matrix. Additive manufacturing has the potential to overcome these difficulties due to the high cooling rate achieved during the process. Here we have developed immiscible Copper-based composites reinforced with Tantalum, which were fabricated using the powder bed fusion melting (PBF-M) technique. The distinct advantage of utilizing Tantalum in this process resides in its high melting point, allowing it to remain in particle form within the composite and contribute to its mechanical and surface/wear properties. The PBF-M results in the in situ fragmentation of micron-size Tantalum particles into nanoparticle form through a surface roughening process during laser interaction, enhancing its mechanical and wear properties. The microstructural evolution of Cu-Ta composites is explained through multiscale numerical modeling. The enhanced yield strength and the dynamics of the Ta particles were corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. The maximum yield strength is exhibited by Cu-5wt%Ta of 80 MPa. Addition of Ta also have significant improvement in wear properties of composites. The current results can be exploited to develop complex shape, high energy efficient copper-based composites.</description>

      <title>On the extension of the concept of rheological connections to a finite deformation framework using multiple natural configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constitutive behaviors of materials are often modeled using a network of different rheological elements. These rheological models are mostly developed within a one-dimensional small strain framework. One of the key impediments of extending these models to a three-dimensional finite deformation setting is to determine how the different types of connections, i.e., a series and a parallel connection, are incorporated into the material models. The primary objective of this article is to develop an appropriate strategy to address this issue. We show that both the series and the parallel connection between two rheological elements can be modeled within a multiple natural configurations framework without changing or introducing new configurations. The difference in a series and a parallel connection is manifested in the ratio of the stress powers expended during the deformations of the associated rheological elements. Finite deformation version of some well-known rheological models have been used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>A comparison of phase field models of brittle fracture incorporating strength: I -- Mixed-mode loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical variational phase-field model for brittle fracture effectively predicts the growth of large pre-existing cracks. However, the modeling of crack nucleation continues to be a significant challenge. Crack nucleation under uniform stress depends on the material's strength surface whose description is fundamentally incompatible with the energy-based Griffith propagation criterion. To address this, three main phase-field approaches have emerged, each attempting to reconcile material strength and toughness. The first, known as the classical variational approach, preserves the variational structure but fails to accurately incorporate the strength surface. In contrast, the other two approaches -- the complete nucleation and hybrid cohesive zone models -- sacrifice variational consistency. Among these, only the complete nucleation approach precisely accounts for the strength surface. All three approaches, especially the second one, deviate from the sharp variational theory of brittle fracture, raising concerns about their reliability in predicting the growth of cracks under non-mode-I loading. This paper evaluates precisely this issue. It is the first in a series of studies comparing the three approaches, systematically investigating crack growth under mode II, mode III, and mixed-mode loadings. The results confirm that the complete nucleation approach effectively predicts crack growth across all investigated problems, and its predictions agree well with those from other two approaches for tension-dominated cases. Additionally, the findings highlight that inaccurate accounting of the strength surface in the classical variational approach can influence crack path predictions. Lastly, they reveal that modifying the crack driving force to incorporate the strength surface in the hybrid cohesive zone approach causes crack propagation at an incorrect fracture toughness.</description>

      <title>Enhanced chemical vapour deposition of monolayer MoS2 films via a clean promoter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), exemplified by molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have shown exceptional potential for data-centred, energy-efficient electronic applications due to their unique electrical, optoelectronic, and mechanical properties. However, challenges such as the controllable synthesis of high-quality, large-area 2D MoS2 films and the mitigation of contamination during growth remain significant barriers to their integration into advanced technologies. Here, we developed a novel contamination-free growth promoter, enabling the clean and scalable synthesis of high quality 2D MoS2 with desirable grain structures via chemical vapour deposition (CVD). By optimising the reactant concentration and S/Mo ratio, we achieved promoter-dominated enhanced growth with enhanced quality, as evidenced by the increased MoS2 flake size and coverage, alongside a strong PL A exciton peak at 1.84 eV, matching that of the mechanically exfoliated sample. This approach facilitates the clean and site-specific growth of high-quality 2D MoS2, establishing a robust pathway for the practical implementation of 2D MoS2 in next-generation electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Athermal Metastable Phase in a Halide Perovskite: Optically Tracked Thermal-Breach Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskite materials have been extensively studied in the last decade because of their impressive optoelectronic properties. However, their one characteristic that is uncommon for semiconductors is that many undergo thermally induced structural phase transitions. The transition is hysteretic, with the hysteresis window marking the boundary of the metastable phase. We have discovered that in methylammonium lead iodide, this hysteretic metastable phase is athermal, meaning it shows almost no temporal phase evolution under isothermal conditions. We also show that a large number of distinguishable metastable states can be prepared following different thermal pathways. Furthermore, under a reversible thermal perturbation, the states in the metastable phase either show return-point memory or undergo a systematic nonrecoverable phase evolution, depending on the thermal history and the sign of the temperature perturbation. Since the phase fraction can be probed with extreme sensitivity via luminescence, we have an optically retrievable memory that reliably records any breach in temperature stability. Such thermal-breach memory in athermal martensites, of which there are numerous examples, may be useful for tagging packages requiring strict temperature control during transportation or preservation.</description>

      <title>Strongly dispersive dielectric properties of high-ScN-fraction ScAlN deposited by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of dielectric properties including complex permittivity, loss, and leakage of high-ScN-fraction ScAlN thin films grown using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Dielectric spectroscopy is carried out on high-ScN-fraction (30%-40% ScN fraction) samples from 20 Hz to 10 GHz. We find that real permittivity {\epsilon}' increases significantly with increasing ScN fraction; a trend confirmed by density functional theory. Further, {\epsilon}' is strongly dispersive with frequency and increasing ScN fraction, with values for Sc0.4Al0.6N varying from 150 down to 60 with increasing frequency. Loss, dispersion, and DC leakage current correspondingly increase with ScN fraction. The high {\epsilon}' and strongly dispersive behavior in MBE ScAlN are not observed in a sputter-deposited ScAlN control with a similar ScN fraction, highlighting fundamental differences between films produced by the two deposition methods. Microscopy and spectroscopy analyses are carried out on MBE- and sputter-deposited samples to compare microstructure, alloy, and dopant concentration.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of Temperature-Induced Phase Separation of Completely Miscible Au-Pd Alloy by In-Situ TEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies reveal key insights into the structural and chemical evolution of nanoparticles (NPs) under external stimuli like heating and biasing, which is critical for evaluating their suitability in chemical reactions and their tendency towards forming novel NP systems. In this study, starting from a core@shell Au nanotriangle (AuNT)@Pd nanostructure, the formation of a phase-separated bi-metallic Au-Pd NP system at high temperature is reported, despite the fact that Au and Pd are miscible in the entire composition and temperature range. In-situ TEM heating of bare AuNT@Pd core@shell structures up to 1000{\deg}C has been performed. Between 400{\deg}C and 800{\deg}C, an initial alloy formation has been observed. It is also noted that higher initial loading of Pd increases the melting temperature of the bi-metallic system. However, the most important observation is the separation of the nanostructure into Au and Pd phases at temperatures higher than 850{\deg} C for high Pd doping. The extent of Pd separation depends on the amount of initial Pd loading. A Janus Au-Pd nanostructure is formed at the end of the thermal treatments at 1000{\deg} C. The phase-separated NP is observed to be highly stable and could be clearly beneficial for various applications, particularly in catalytic processes.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Factors Governing Stabilization of Janus 2D-Bulk Heterostructures with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The more-than-6000 2D materials predicted thus far provide a huge combinatorial space for forming functional heterostructures with bulk materials, with potential applications in nanoelectronics, sensing, and energy conversion. In this work, we investigate nearly 1000 heterostructures, the largest number of heterostructures thus far, of 2D Janus and bulk materials' surfaces using ab initio simulations and machine learning (ML) to deduce the structure-property relationships of the complex interfaces in such heterostructures. We first perform van der Waals-corrected density functional theory simulations using a high-throughput computational framework on 51 Janus 2D materials and 19 metallic, cubic phase, elemental bulk materials that exhibit low lattice mismatches and low coincident site lattices. The formation energy of the resultant 1147 Janus 2D-bulk heterostructures were analyzed and 828 were found to be thermodynamically stable. ML models were trained on the computed data, and we found that they could predict the binding energy and $z$-separation of 2D-bulk heterostructures with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.05 eV/atom and 0.14 angstroms, respectively. The feature importance of the models reveals that the properties of the bulk materials dominate the heterostructures' energies and interfacial structures heavily. These findings are in-line with experimentally observed behavior of several well-known 2D materials-bulk systems. The data used within this paper is freely available in the Ab Initio 2D-Bulk Heterostructure Database (aiHD). The fundamental insights on 2D-bulk heterostructures and the predictive ML models developed in this work could accelerate the application of thousands of 2D-bulk heterostructures, thus stimulating research within a wide range of electronic, quantum computing, sensing, and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Pure momentum-shift bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric flat-band Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift current photovoltaic effect is conventionally understood as the real-space displacement of a wave packet induced by photoexcitation. However, this interpretation becomes insufficient in flat-band systems, where quasiparticles are too massive to accelerate in real space under the optical electric field. Here, we developed a gauge-invariant method to decompose the shift current into real-space and momentum-space components. A surprising pure momentum-space shift current is found theoretically in flat-band Mott insulator Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br, I) monolayers. This work underscores that significant shift current responses can emerge even in systems with minimal interband polarization differences, highlighting the potential for exploring novel bulk photovoltaic effects in flat-band Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a large magnetic nonlinear Hall effect in an altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Edwin Halls groundbreaking discovery of the Hall effect in 1879, magnetism, spin, and quantization have been expanding the scope of Hall effects, continuously driving transformative progress in science and technology. Among them, the latest nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), where longitudinal electric field tunes quantum geometry to generate nonlinear Hall voltage, attracts wide attention as a sensitive probe of topological phases across a wide range of materials. Here, we report a new Hall effect member: the magnetic nonlinear Hall effect (MNLHE), characterized by a quadratic Hall conductivity dependence on magnetic field, rather than electric field as in NLHE. This finding relies on an altermagnet, Mn5Si3 thin film, whose alternating-sign Berry curvatures ensure higher-order MNLHE clearly distinguishable from the first-order anomalous Hall effect. The observed quadratic dependence originates from chiral next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes that acquire magnetic-exchange-driven Zeeman energies and Haldane-like chiral flux phases. Remarkably, this MNLHE is non-analytic, as reversing the magnetic field flips the alternating spin-splitting bands and reverses the hopping chirality, which is absent in traditional NLHE. Beyond offering a distinctive transport fingerprint for altermagnet Mn5Si3 thin film, this MNLHE is large and unsaturated up to 60 T, providing opportunities for pulsed high-field sensing technologies in both fundamental researches and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>FF7: A Code Package for High-throughput Calculations and Constructing Materials Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades accumulation of theory simulations lead to boom in material database, which combined with machine learning methods has been a valuable driver for the data-intensive material discovery, i.e., the fourth research paradigm. However, construction of segmented databases and data reuse in generic databases with uniform parameters still lack easy-to-use code tools. We herein develop a code package named FF7 (Fast Funnel with 7 modules) to provide command-line based interactive interface for performing customized high-throughput calculations and building your own handy databases. Data correlation studies and material property prediction can progress by built-in installation-free artificial neural network module and various post processing functions are also supported by auxiliary module. This paper shows the usage of FF7 code package and demonstrates its usefulness by example of database driven thermodynamic stability high-throughput calculation and machine learning model for predicting the superconducting critical temperature of clathrate hydrides.</description>

      <title>Unraveling effects of competing interactions and frustration in vdW ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 nanoflake devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets and devices have garnered significant attention owing to the stabilization of long range magnetic order down to atomic limit, and the prospect for novel quantum devices with unique functionalities. To achieve this objective, clarification of magnetotransport properties and understanding of the relevant interactions with lowering of dimensions are of extreme importance. Here, the magnetotransport properties of few atomic layer Fe3GeTe2 and (Co0.25Fe0.75)3GeTe2 nanoflake devices have been investigated. Magnetotransport investigations with applied magnetic field along the easy-axis shows anomalous Hall effect, while that for applied magnetic field along the hard-axis reveals an unusual behaviour. Atomistic calculations considering the presence of antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic and local symmetry-breaking interactions reveal critical role of magnetic frustration effect assisted by thermal fluctuations, leading to a non-zero scalar spin chirality manifesting in an unconventional Hall effect. The present result clarifies the underlying interactions in few-layer 2D vdW ferromagnetic material system, important for the understanding of non-collinear spin configurations in vdW magnets for 2D spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio techniques for studying the optical and vibrational properties of materials are well-established, but only a few recent studies have focused on the interaction between excitons and atomic vibrations. In this paper, we revisit the excited state forces method, which integrates results from GW/BSE and DFPT calculations to determine the gradient of the excited state energy. We explore its technical aspects, including convergence and the quality of approximations used. We successfully apply this method to investigate self-trapped excitons in LiF. The excited state forces method provides valuable insights into ionic dynamics in the excited state and the microscopic mechanism of exciton self-trapping.</description>

      <title>Paper-based colorimetric sensor for detection of chloride anions in water using an epoxy-silver nanocomposite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An epoxy-silver nanocomposite printed on paper was prepared for colorimetric detection of chloride anions (Cl$^-$) in aqueous solution. This paper-based sensor provides a promising platform with attractive advantages such as simple fabrication, intense colors, fast naked-eye response, and high specificity toward Cl$^-$ detection. The sensor undergoes a color change from yellow-orange to chestnut-brown in the presence of water and turns to green-brown in the presence of Cl$^-$. A good linear relationship ($R^2$=0.9754) between logarithmic Cl$^-$ concentration and the extinction intensity difference at 515 nm was observed at concentrations in the 20-400 mM range with a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 mM, far beyond the usual concentrations at which most of the Cl$^-$ colorimetric sensors are limited. It was also proposed a sensing mechanism based on the oxidative etching of anisotropic silver nanoparticles (from 20 to 250 nm) by Cl$^-$ and subsequent formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in strong interparticle plasmonic coupling. This paper-based sensor can distinguish Cl$^-$ from other ions such as F$^{-}$, OH$^{-}$, NO$_{3}^{-}$, SO$_{4}^{2-}$, HPO$_{4}^{2-}$, H$_{2}$PO$_{4}^{-}$, H$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, NH$_{4}^{+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, and Co$^{2+}$ and from mixtures of these ions. The nanosensor was also tested to recognize Cl$^{-}$ in seawater and a commercial electrolyte solution, even using volumes as small as 4 $\mu$L, suggesting its easy inclusion in portable devices. This novel colorimetric platform is undoubtedly useful for recognizing Cl$^-$ in environmental and physiological systems.</description>

      <title>Self-limiting states of polar misfits: Frustrated assembly of warped-jigsaw particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground state thermodynamics of a model class of geometrically frustrated assemblies, known as {\it warped-jigsaw} particles. While it is known that frustration in soft matter assemblies has the ability to propagate up to mesoscopic, multi-particle size scales, notably through the selection of self-limiting domain, little is understood about how the symmetry of shape-misfit at the particle scale influences emergent morphologies at the mesoscale. Here we show that polarity in the shape-misfit of warped-jigsaw puzzles manifests at a larger scale in the morphology and thermodynamics of the ground-state assembly of self-limiting domains. We use a combination of continuum theory and discrete particle simulations to show that the polar misfit gives rise to two mesoscopically distinct polar, self-limiting ribbon domains. Thermodynamic selection between the two ribbon morphologies is controlled by a combination of the binding anisotropy along distinct neighbor directions and the orientation of polar shape-misfit. These predictions are valuable as design features for ongoing efforts to program self-limiting assemblies through the synthesis of intentionally frustrated particles, and further suggests a generic classification of frustrated assembly behavior in terms of the relative symmetries of shape-misfit and the underlying long-range inter-particle order it frustrates.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian topological disclination states and charge fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been significant interest in exploring topological disclination states, which effectively probe the band topology of the host material beyond the conventional bulk-edge correspondence. While most studies in this area have primarily focused on Hermitian systems, recent theoretical work predicts that non-Hermiticity can drive topological phase transitions and host topological disclination states associated with fractional charge. However, no experimental observations have been reported to date. Here, we report the first experimental observation of topological disclination states in electric circuits, induced solely by gain and loss. Through admittance matrix measurements and eigenstate analysis, we confirm their emergence and compute the corresponding fractional charge. Moreover, the disclination mode profile and localization effect can be directly visualized via monochromatic field excitation. Additionally, we demonstrate the emergence of degenerate zero-energy topological disclination states, devoid of fractional charge, in distinct non-Hermitian geometries. Our findings open the possibility of non-Hermiticity-induced fractional charges in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices, which may pave the way for advancements in active topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Lattice-Gas Model for Methane Clathrate Hydrates: Comparative Analysis with Experiments and Three-Dimensional Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methane clathrate hydrates, particularly those with an sI structure, are significant due to their potential as energy resources and their impact on gas pipelines. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) lattice-gas model is employed to investigate the main thermodynamic properties of methane clathrate hydrates. The proposed framework is validated through comparison with experimental data and more advanced three-dimensional (3D) simulations. Adsorption isotherms, dissociation enthalpy and phase stability of the sI structure are evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The 2D adsorption isotherms closely align with both experimental data and 3D simulations, demonstrating the 2D model's ability to precisely represent both rigid and flexible sI structures. The dissociation enthalpy calculated using our approach (76.4 kJ/mol) excellently matches the experimental value (78 kJ/mol), confirming the model's accuracy. Furthermore, the phase diagram obtained from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation shows very good agreement with experimental data between 260 and 290 K, though deviations are observed above 290 K. These findings underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the 2D model in studying methane clathrate hydrates and suggest its potential applicability for investigating other guest species and hydrate structures.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Effects of Curvature and Misorientation on the Shrinkage Behavior of Loop-Shaped Grain Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The material properties of polycrystals are strongly affected by the evolution and coarsening of their internal grain structures. Yet, studying this process is challenging due to the complex interactions within grain boundary networks. Here, we systematically investigate the shrinkage of isolated loop-shaped grain boundaries in 2D colloidal crystals. Unexpectedly, we find that shear coupling decreases with increasing grain misorientation, contrary to geometric predictions. This counterintuitive result is attributed to enhanced concurrent sliding driven by the annihilation of dislocations. Furthermore, by focusing on the evolution of the grain size, we reveal a transition in shrinkage kinetics between small and large loop sizes, offering an explanation for previously observed discrepancies in grain boundary mobility. These findings reveal a more intricate dependence of grain boundary behavior on curvature and misorientation than previously reported, offering new insights into polycrystal coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic properties of Fe-Co-C alloys with tetragonal deformation: a first-principle study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fe-Co alloys with induced tetragonal strain are promising materials for rare-earth-free permanent magnets. However, as ultrathin-film studies have shown, tetragonal Fe-Co structures tend to a rapid relaxation toward a cubic structure as the thickness of the deposited film increases. One of the main methods of inducing the stable strain in the bulk material is interstitial doping with small atoms, like B, C, or N. In this work, we present a full configuration space analysis in density functional theory approach for (Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_{16}$C supercells with a single C impurity in one of the octahedral interstitial positions and for the full range of Co concentrations $x$. We discuss all assumptions and considerations leading to calculated lattice parameters, mixing enthalpies, magnetic moments, and averaged magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE). We present a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the structural and magnetic properties' dependence on short- and long-range ordering parameters. We analyzed all unique Fe/Co atoms occupancies at all stoichiometric concentrations possible in 2x2x2 supercell based on 2-atom tetragonal representation. We rely on the thermodynamic averaging method and large sample count to obtain accurate MAE values. We reevaluate several chemical disorder approximation methods, including effective medium methods (virtual crystal approximation and coherent potential approximation) and special quasirandom structures method applied to Fe-Co-based alloys. We observe a structural phase transition from the body-centered tetragonal structure above 70% Co concentration and confirm the structural stability of Fe-Co-C alloys in the tetragonal range. We show the presence of a broad MAE maximum of around 50% Co concentration and notably high MAE values for Co content $x$ as low as 25%. In addition, we show a positive correlation between MAE and mixing enthalpy.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Muffin Tin Orbitals (EWMTO) and Energy Window Linear Muffin Tin orbitals (EWLMTO) within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose two new, closely related, efficient basis sets for the electronic structure problem. The basis sets are based on the Muffin Tin Orbital (MTO) idea that the eigenstates of the Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian may we be expanded in terms of eigenstates of the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the so called Muffin Tin (MT) spheres and Bessel functions in the interstitial multiplied by appropriate spherical Harmonics. Here we use the fact that the solution to the finding the ground state electron density is most often found through an iterative process: where generically on the order of over twenty iterations are taken till the ground state electron density and energy converges to the lowest values allowed by the correlation and exchange functional. We use eigenstate information from the previous iteration loop to choose the energies of the basis set elements used to study the KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore within the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA) the energies of the Bessel functions do not matter, as they are cancelled out other than for boundary conditions, and are chosen at zero energy. This is an efficient method aimed at studying the electronic structure of materials with large unit cells especially if they are of close packed form where ASA is particularly accurate.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld-Bethe analysis of ZT in inhomogeneous thermoelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of good thermoelectric materials exhibiting high $ZT$ (=$\frac{PF}{\kappa} T$) requires maximizing power factor, $PF$, mainly governed by electrons, and minimizing thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, associated not only with electrons but also with phonons. In the present work, we focus on the GeTe and Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ as high $ZT$ materials with inhomogeneous structures and analyze both electrical conductivity, $L_{11}$, and Seebeck coefficient, $S$, with help of Sommerfeld-Bethe formula, resulting in understanding the temperature dependence of $PF$ and the identification of electrons contribution to thermal conductivity, $\kappa_{\rm el}$. Comparing the obtained $\kappa_{\rm el}$ and experimentally measured $\kappa$, the temperature dependence of phonons contribution to thermal conductivity, $\kappa_{\rm ph}=\kappa-\kappa_{\rm el}$, is inferred and analyzed based on the formula by Holland. Comparison of the GeTe and Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ with different types of crystal structures, i.e., GeTe being of a semiordered zigzag nanostructure like a disrupted herringbone structure while Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ of rather uniform amorphous structure, discloses that size effects on temperature dependence of $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ is large in the former, while very small in the latter. Hence, it is concluded that not only the size of the grain but also its shape has an important influence on $\kappa_{\rm ph}$ and then $ZT$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use first-principles scattering calculations based upon wave-function matching and implemented with a tight-binding MTO basis to evaluate the orbital Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ for Ti, V, Cr, Cu and Pt metals with temperature-induced lattice disorder. Only interatomic fluxes of orbital angular momentum are included in these estimates; intraatomic fluxes which do not contribute to the transfer of angular momentum are explicitly excluded. The resistivity and orbital Hall angle are both found to be linear in temperature so $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ is at most weakly temperature dependent. The value of $\sigma_{\rm oH}$ we obtain for bulk Cr is $ \approx 2 \times 10^3 (\hbar/e) \, (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$ which is substantially lower than previously obtained theoretical results but agrees well with experiment. In units of $10^3 (\hbar/e) (\Omega \, {\rm cm})^{-1}$, the values obtained for Ti, V and Pt are $5$, $6$ and $7$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of the electronic structure of metal alloys is hampered by the in-applicability of conventional quantum oscillation measurements owing to electron scattering by thermal or alloy disorder. Recent advancements in the study of the electronic contribution to the entropy suggest a path to ground transport properties in alloy equilibrium thermodynamics. Fe-Ni represents an interesting test-case because it exhibits an intricate electronic structure, order-disorder transformations, and a large solid-solution region where equilibrium data can be obtained. Using cluster modeling, the electronic contribution to the entropy can be inferred from high-temperature thermodynamic data. Electronic transport property measurements can be used to independently evaluate the electronic contribution to the entropy. Reconciling these two approaches at high temperature supports this method to study electronic structure for metal alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites are lead-free materials for potential photovoltaic or thermoelectric applications. BaZrS$_3$ is the most studied member of this family due to its superior thermal and chemical stability, desirable optoelectronic properties, and low thermal conductivity. Phase transitions of BaZrS$_3$ remain underexplored in the literature, as most experimental characterizations of this material have been performed at ambient conditions where the orthorhombic Pnma phase is reported to be stable. In this work, we study the dynamics of BaZrS$_3$ across a range of temperatures and pressures using an accurate machine-learning interatomic potential trained with data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. At 0 Pa, we find a first-order phase transition from the orthorhombic to tetragonal I4/mcm phase at 610 K, and a second-order transition from the tetragonal to the cubic Pm-3m phase at 880 K. The tetragonal phase is stable over a larger temperature range at higher pressures. To confirm the validity of our model we compare our results with a range of published experimental data and report a prediction for the X-ray diffraction pattern as a function of temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain-regulated ferroelectric (FE) materials have long attracted significant attention due to their diverse applications. While soft-phonon theory and the (pseudo) Jahn-Teller effect have achieved considerable success in providing phenomenological descriptions and general understanding, the detailed connection between these perspectives and their microscopic dependence on strain regulation remains unclear. Here, under the framework of density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), we demonstrate that the Berry curvature of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) plays a pivotal role in the interatomic force matrix (IFM). A subsequent model analysis shows that external strain can reverse the polarity of the EPC Berry curvature in (quasi)-degenerate electronic subsystems through band inversion, thereby directly leading to phonon softening. The general theory is then applied to the BiOCl monolayer as a benchmark, which offers an accurate description of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This mechanism is further observed across a broad range of materials through ab initio calculations, providing an insightful perspective on EPC quantum geometry in lattice dynamics and FE phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Pisarenko's Formula for the Thermopower</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermopower $\alpha$ (also known as the Seebeck coefficient) is one of the most fundamental material characteristics for understanding charge carrier transport in thermoelectric materials. Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower $\alpha$ and charge carrier concentration $n$ beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, $\alpha = \pm \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{e} (b - \ln \sigma)$, valid for materials with $\alpha &gt; 90$ $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature.</description>

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a quantitative noncontact measurement method for the thermal Hall effect (THE) based on magnetic-field-modulated lock-in thermography. This method enables visualization of THE-induced temperature change and quantitative estimation of the thermal Hall angle $\theta_{\rm THE}$ by applying periodic magnetic fields to a sample and obtaining the first harmonic response of thermal images. By combining this method with LIT-based measurement techniques for the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$, we also quantify the transverse thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$. We validate our measurement methods by estimating $\theta_{\rm THE}$, $\kappa_{xx}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$ in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co$_2$MnGa slab showing large THE.</description>

Abstract: Non-destructive testing is an important technique for detecting defects in multi-layer materials, enabling the evaluation of structural integrity without causing damage on test materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers unique capabilities for this purpose due to its sensitivity and resolution. Inspired by room geometry estimation methods in acoustic signal processing, this work proposes a novel approach for defect detection in multi-layer composite materials using THz-TDS, enhanced by high-power sources. The proposed method utilizes Euclidean distance matrices to reduce problem complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively distinguishes and maps higher-order reflections from sublayers, enabling precise defect localization in composite materials without artifacts.</description>
