      <title>Exploration of novel ICP using helicon antennas with zero magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) attracts great attention from aspects of fundamental research and practical applications, and efficient power coupling is highly desirable for both of them. The present study explores a novel strategy for efficient ICP through using helicon antennas with zero external magnetic field. Specific research is devoted to the effects of antenna geometry (loop, half-helix, Boswell, Nagoya III), driving frequency (13.56-54.24 MHz) and radial density profile (Gaussian and parabolic) on power coupling. Findings reveal that: loop antenna yields higher power deposition efficiency than half-helix, Boswell, and Nagoya III antennas, driving frequency gives negligible effects, and parabolic density profile results in more efficient power coupling than Gaussian density profile especially in the radial direction, for the conditions employed here. Therefore, it is suggested that for this novel ICP strategy one should use loop antenna with parabolic density profile, and the industrial frequency of 13.56 MHz can work well. This study provides a valuable reference for the novel design of efficient ICP sources, which could be used for material processing and space propulsion, etc. Key words: Inductively coupled plasma; Antenna Geometry; Power Deposition; Driving Frequency</description>

      <title>Exploration on the Two-stream Instability in the Polar Cusp Under Solar Storm Disturbances and its Potential Impacts on Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During solar storms, the polar cusp often exhibits electron populations with distinct velocity distributions, which may be associated with the two-stream instability. This study reveals the evolution of the two-stream instability associated with electron velocities and the interaction between the growth phase of the two-stream instability and the electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs). The results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are compared with satellite observational data and computational outcomes. The potential risks associated with two-stream instability, including surface charge accumulation and communication system interference on spacecraft, are also explored. The findings show that, in the high-latitude polar cusp region, the interaction between the solar wind plasma propagating along magnetic field lines and the upward-moving ionospheric plasma could drive two-stream instability, leading to the formation of electron hole structures in phase space and triggering a bipolar distribution of ESWs. When the spatial magnetic field and wave vector meet specific conditions, the enhanced electron cyclotron motion could suppress the formation of two-stream instability and electron hole structures, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of the ESWs. The results offer valuable insights for a deeper understanding of the impact of solar storms on the polar cusp environment, as well as for monitoring electromagnetic environment and ensuring the stable operation of spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Suppression of pair beam instabilities in a laboratory analogue of blazar pair cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of dense electron-positron pair beams in the laboratory can enable direct tests of theoretical models of $\gamma$-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. We have successfully achieved this using ultra-relativistic protons accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. In the first application of this experimental platform, the stability of the pair beam is studied as it propagates through a metre-length plasma, analogous to TeV $\gamma$-ray induced pair cascades in the intergalactic medium. It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from $\gamma$-ray observations of blazars is robust.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emission mechanism powering long period radio transients from interacting white dwarf binaries via kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of long period radio transients, such as GLEAM-X J0704-37 and ILTJ1101 + 5521, have revealed a previously unrecognized population of galactic radio transient sources associated with white dwarf - M dwarf binaries. It is an open question how to produce coherent radio emission in these systems, though a model driven by binary interaction seems likely given the nature and correlation of the emission with the binaries' orbital period. Using kinetic plasma simulations, we demonstrate that the relativistic electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) is a viable mechanism for generating radio pulses in white dwarf - M dwarf systems, akin to planetary radio emission, such as that from the Jupiter-Io system. We quantify the relativistic ECMI in the nonlinear regime under conditions relevant for white dwarf radio emission for the first time. Our simulations demonstrate that the ECMI can intrinsically produce partially linearly polarized emission relevant to explaining the observed emission spectrum of the two galactic sources, though the precise details will depend on the plasma composition. Our work paves the way for a systematic and fully nonlinear computational modeling of radio emission from interacting white dwarf sources.</description>

      <title>Vorticity Packing Effects on Turbulent Transport in Decaying 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of initial vorticity packing fractions on the transport properties of decaying incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions. Turbulence is initiated via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and evolves through nonlinear inverse energy cascades, forming large-scale coherent structures that dominate the flow over long eddy turnover times. The initial vorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively distinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors. Tracer particle trajectories are computed in the fluid field obtained using the Eulerian framework, with transport and mixing quantified using statistical measures such as absolute dispersion, position probability distribution functions (PDFs), and velocity PDFs. In the early stages, the onset of turbulence is primarily governed by the instability growth rate, which increases with vorticity packing fraction. As the flow evolves, transport exhibits a range of behaviors-subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive-and transitions between anisotropic and isotropic regimes, depending on the initial vorticity packing, flow structure, and stage of evolution. At later times, transport is dominated by the motion of large-scale coherent vortices, whose dynamics are also influenced by the initial vorticity packing ranging from subdiffusive trapping rotational motion and random walks, and L\'evy flight-like events. These findings offer insights into transport in quasi-2D systems-ranging from laboratory-scale flows to geophysical phenomena and astrophysical structures-through analogies with 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic finite difference scheme for anisotropic diffusion equations: preserving the discrete maximum principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hyperbolic system approach is proposed for robust computation of anisotropic diffusion equations that appear in quasineutral plasmas. Though the approach exhibits merits of high extensibility and accurate flux computation, the monotonicity of the scheme for anisotropic diffusion cases has not been understood. In this study, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) of the hyperbolic system approach is analyzed and tested in various anisotropic diffusion cases. A mathematical analysis is conducted to obtain an optimal condition of an arbitrary parameter to guarantee the DMP, and numerical experiments reveal an adoptive selection of the parameter for DMP-preserving results. It is confirmed that, with an appropriate preconditioning matrix and parameter choice, the hyperbolic system approach preserves the DMP even with a linear discretization.</description>
