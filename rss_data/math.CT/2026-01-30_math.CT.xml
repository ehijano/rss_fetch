      <title>The Leibniz adjunction in homotopy type theory, with an application to simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory and equips types with a notion of directed morphisms. A Segal type is defined to be a type in which these directed morphisms can be composed. We show that all higher coherences can be stated and derived if simplicial type theory is taken to be homotopy type theory with a postulated interval type. In technical terms, this means that if a type has unique fillers for $(2,1)$-horns, it has unique fillers for all inner $(n,k)$-horns. This generalizes a result of Riehl and Shulman for the case $n = 3, k \in \{1, 2\}$. Our main technical tool is the Leibniz adjunction: the pushout-product is left adjoint to the pullback-hom in the wild category of types. While this adjunction is well known for ordinary categories, it is much more involved for higher categories, and the fact that it can be proved for the wild category of types (a higher category without stated higher coherences) is non-trivial. We make profitable use of the equivalence between the wild category of maps and that of families. We have formalized the results in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian Rees construction and pure motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Rees construction (of common use in commutative algebra and Hodge theory) interpolates between filtrations, viewed as ${\mathbb G}_m$-equivariant vector bundles on the affine line, and their associated gradings. Various non-abelian versions have been proposed, where the multiplicative group ${\mathbb G}_m$ is replaced by an arbitrary reductive group. Building on a construction due to P. O'Sullivan, we present a Galois correspondence between quasi-homogeneous spaces and certain monoidal categories, and apply it to monoidal categories of motives with concrete applications to algebraic cycles. In particular, we give a new proof and generalization of the Clozel-Deligne theorem about numerical equivalence on abelian varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>New examples of non-Fourier-Mukai exact functors via non-isomorphic octahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a triangulated category $\mathscr S$ that admits a full and strong exceptional sequence of three objects with one-dimensional Hom spaces. We show that the isomorphism classes of exact functors from $\mathscr S$ to another triangulated category $\mathscr T$ are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of octahedra in $\mathscr T$ satisfying a natural condition. As an application, we construct an exact functor from $\mathscr S$ to $\mathbf D^b(\Bbbk[x]\text{-}\mathrm{mod})$ that does not admit a dg lift. This provides an explicit example of a non-Fourier-Mukai exact functor between $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^2)$ and $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^1)$.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Equivariant Networks are Layerwise Equivariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.</description>

      <title>Fully exact and fully dualizable module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define fully exact module categories, a subclass of exact module categories over a finite braided tensor category that is stable under the relative Deligne product. In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones.
  The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable.
  In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect.
  As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity.</description>

      <title>Constructing linear bicategories</title>

Abstract: Linearly distributive categories were introduced to model the tensor/par fragment of linear logic, without resorting to the use of negation. Linear bicategories are the bicategorical version of linearly distributive categories. Essentially, a linear bicategory has two forms of composition, each determining the structure of a bicategory, and the two compositions are related by a linear distribution. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that there are many examples of linear bicategories, which are obtained by considering quantales and quantaloids. It is standard in the field of monoidal topology that the category of quantale-valued relations is a bicategory. Here we begin by showing that a quantale is Girard if and only if the corresponding bicategory is a Girard quantaloid, which is an example of linear bicategory. The tropical and arctic semiring structures fit together into a Girard quantale, so this construction is likely to have multiple applications. More generally, we define LD-quantales, which are sup-lattices with two quantale structures related by a linear distribution, and their bicategorical analogue, linear quantaloids. We show that Q-Rel is a linear quantaloid if and only if Q is an LD-quantale. We then consider several standard constructions from enriched bicategory theory, and show that these lift to the linear quantaloid setting and produce new examples of linear bicategories. In particular, we consider linear Q-categories, matrices in Q and linear monads in Q, where Q is a linear quantaloid. We develop non-locally posetal examples as well, Quant, the bicategory of quantales, modules and module homomorphisms, and Qtld, the bicategory of quantaloids, modules and module homomorphisms. These turn out to be cyclic *-autonomous bicategories, which are in essence a closed version of linear bicategories.</description>

      <title>Linearly Distributive Fox Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearly distributive categories (LDC), introduced by Cockett and Seely to model multiplicative linear logic, are categories equipped with two monoidal structures that interact via linear distributivities. A seminal result in monoidal category theory is the Fox theorem, which characterizes cartesian categories as symmetric monoidal categories whose objects are equipped with canonical comonoid structures. The aim of this work is to extend the Fox theorem to LDCs and characterize the subclass of cartesian linearly distributive categories (CLDC). To do so, we introduce medial linearly distributive categories (MLDC), medial linear functors, and medial linear transformations. The former are LDCs which respect the logical medial rule, appearing frequently in deep inference, or alternatively are the appropriate structure at the intersection of LDCs and duoidal categories.</description>

      <title>On pure monomorphisms and pure epimorphisms in accessible categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In all $\kappa$-accessible additive categories, $\kappa$-pure monomorphisms and $\kappa$-pure epimorphisms are well-behaved, as shown in our previous paper arXiv:2311.02418. This is known to be not always true in $\kappa$-accessible nonadditive categories. Nevertheless, mild assumptions on a $\kappa$-accessible category are sufficient to prove good properties of $\kappa$-pure monomorphisms and $\kappa$-pure epimorphisms. In particular, in a $\kappa$-accessible category with finite products, all $\kappa$-pure monomorphisms are $\kappa$-directed colimits of split monomorphisms, while in a $\kappa$-accessible category with finite coproducts, all $\kappa$-pure epimorphisms are $\kappa$-directed colimits of split epimorphisms. We also discuss what we call Quillen exact classes of monomorphisms and epimorphisms, generalizing the additive concept of one-sided exact category.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>
