      <title>Detectability of Surface Biosignatures for Directly-Imaged Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the detection of life has never been more opportune. With next generation space telescopes, like the currently developing Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) concept, we will begin to characterize rocky exoplanets potentially similar to Earth. However, currently, few realistic planetary spectra containing surface biosignatures have been paired with direct imaging telescope instrument models. Therefore, we use a HWO instrument noise model to assess the detection of surface biosignatures affiliated with oxygenic, anoxygenic, and nonphotosynthetic extremophiles. We pair the HWO telescope model to a 1-D radiative transfer model to estimate the required exposure times necessary for detecting each biosignature on planets with global microbial coverage and varying atmospheric water vapor concentrations. For modeled planets with 0% - 50% cloud coverage, we determine pigments and the red edge could be detected within 1,000 hours (100 hours) at distances within 15 pc (11 pc). However, tighter telescope inner working angles (2.5 lambda/D) would allow surface biosignature detection at further distances. Anoxygenic photosynthetic biosignatures could also be more easily detectable than nonphotosynthetic pigments and the photosynthetic red edge when compared against a false positive iron oxide slope. Future life detection missions should evaluate the influence of false positives on the detection of multiple surface biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Primordial dust rings, hidden dust mass, and the first generation of planetesimals in gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. A new mechanism of dust accumulation and planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable disk with suppressed magnetorotational instability is studied and compared with the classical dead zone in a layered disk model. Methods. We use numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit FEOSAD code to model the formation and long-term evolution of gravitationally unstable disks, including dust dynamics and growth. Results. We found that in gravitationally unstable disks with a radially varying strength of gravitational instability a region of low mass and angular momentum transport forms in the inner several astronomical units. This region is characterized by low effective \alpha_GI and is similar in characteristics to the dead zone in the layered disk model. As the disk forms and evolves, the GI-induced dead zone accumulates a massive dust ring, which is susceptible to the development of the streaming instability. The model and observationally inferred dust masses and radii may differ significantly in gravitationally unstable disks with massive inner dust rings. Conclusions. The early occurrence of the GI-induced dust ring followed by the presumed development of the streaming instability suggest that this mechanism may form the first generation of planetesimals in the inner terrestrial zone of the disk. The proposed mechanism, however, crucially depends on the susceptibility of the disk to gravitational instability and requires that the magnetorotational instability be suppressed.</description>

      <title>TESS Free-floating Planet Candidate Is Likely a Stellar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet candidate in the light curve of the star TIC 107150013 observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has recently been announced. A short-duration (~0.5 day), low-amplitude (~0.06 mag) brightening in the TESS light curve was interpreted as a short-timescale gravitational microlensing event. However, the purported event occurred far from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane (l~ 239 deg, b ~ -5 deg), on a relatively nearby (~3.2 kpc) star, making the microlensing interpretation unlikely. Here, we report the archival photometric observations of TIC 107150013 collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2018 through 2020. The archival OGLE light curve reveals periodic variability indicative of starspots on the surface of the star. The presence of starspots indicates magnetic activity of the star, which may also manifest as stellar flares. We interpret the brightening of TIC 107150013 seen in the TESS data as the stellar flare. We present similar flaring stars detected in the archival OGLE data, mimicking short-timescale, low-amplitude microlensing events. Such stars may be a source of non-negligible false positive detections in the planned space-based microlensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Eclipse Mapping of the Hot Jupiter WASP-43b with JWST MIRI/LRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present eclipse maps of the two-dimensional thermal emission from the dayside of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, derived from an observation of a phase curve with the JWST MIRI/LRS instrument. The observed eclipse shapes deviate significantly from those expected for a planet emitting uniformly over its surface. We fit a map to this deviation, constructed from spherical harmonics up to order $\ell_{\rm max}=2$, alongside the planetary, orbital, stellar, and systematic parameters. This yields a map with a meridionally-averaged eastward hot-spot shift of $(7.75 \pm 0.36)^{\circ}$, with no significant degeneracy between the map and the additional parameters. We show the latitudinal and longitudinal contributions of the day-side emission structure to the eclipse shape, finding a latitudinal signal of $\sim$200 ppm and a longitudinal signal of $\sim$250 ppm. To investigate the sensitivity of the map to the method, we fix the non-mapping parameters and derive an "eigenmap" fitted with an optimised number of orthogonal phase curves, which yields a similar map to the $\ell_{\rm max}=2$ map. We also fit a map up to $\ell_{\rm max}=3$, which shows a smaller hot-spot shift, with a larger uncertainty. These maps are similar to those produced by atmospheric simulations. We conclude that there is a significant mapping signal which constrains the spherical harmonic components of our model up to $\ell_{\rm max}=2$. Alternative mapping models may derive different structures with smaller-scale features; we suggest that further observations of WASP-43b and other planets will drive the development of more robust methods and more accurate maps.</description>

      <title>Host star properties of hot, warm and cold Jupiters in the solar neighborhood from \textit{Gaia} DR3: clues to formation pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets exhibit diverse orbital properties, hinting at their distinct formation and dynamic histories. In this paper, using $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, we investigate if and how the orbital properties of Jupiters are linked to their host star properties, particularly their metallicity and age. We obtain metallicities for main sequence stars of spectral type F, G, and K, hosting hot, warm, and cold Jupiters with varying eccentricities. We compute the velocity dispersion of host stars of these three groups using kinematic information from $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 and obtain average ages using velocity dispersion-age relation. We find that host stars of hot Jupiters are relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]=$0.18 \pm 0.13$) and young ( median age $3.97 \pm 0.51$ Gyr) compared to the host stars of cold Jupiters in nearly circular orbits, which are relatively metal-poor ($0.03 \pm 0.18$) and older (median age $6.07 \pm 0.79$ Gyr). Host stars of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits, on the other hand, show metallicities similar to that of the hosts of hot Jupiters, but are older, on average (median age $6.25 \pm 0.92$ Gyr). The similarity in metallicity between hosts of hot Jupiters and hosts of cold Jupiters in high eccentric orbits supports high eccentricity migration as the potential origin of hot Jupiters, with the latter serving as the progenitors. However, the average age difference between them suggests that the older hot Jupiters may have been engulfed by the star in a timescale of $\sim 6$ Gyr. This allows us to estimate the value of stellar tidal quality factor $Q'_\ast\sim10^{6\pm1}$.</description>

      <title>A general polarimetric model for transiting and non-transiting ringed exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of polarimetry as a tool for detecting and characterizing exorings. For that purpose, we have improved the publicly available photometric code Pryngles by adding the results of radiative transfer calculations that fully include polarization and scattering by irregularly shaped particles. With this improved code, we compute the total and polarized fluxes and the degree of polarization of a ringed gas giant along its orbit. We vary key model parameters such as the orbit inclination, ring size and orientation, particle albedo and optical thickness, and demonstrate the versatility of our code by predicting the total and polarized fluxes of the "puffed-up" planet HIP41378f assuming this planet has an opaque dusty ring. We find that spatially unresolved dusty rings can significantly modify the flux and polarization signals of the light that is reflected. Rings are expected to have a low polarization signal and will generally decrease the degree of polarization as the ring casts a shadow on the planet and/or blocks part of the light the planet reflects. During ring-plane crossings, when the thin ring is illuminated edge-on, a ringed exoplanet's flux and degree of polarization are close to those of a ring-less planet and generally appear as sharp changes in the flux and polarization curves. Ringed planets in edge-on orbits tend to be difficult to distinguish from ring-less planets in reflected flux and degree of polarization. We show that if HIP41378f is surrounded by a ring, its reflected flux (compared to the star) will be of the order of $10^{-9}$, and the ring would decrease the degree of polarization in a detectable way. The improved version of the photometric code Pryngles that we present here shows that dusty rings may produce distinct polarimetric features in light curves across a wide range of orbital configurations, orientations and ring optical properties.</description>

      <title>The azimuthal distribution of ejecta mass from oblique impacts into sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure ejecta mass as a function of azimuthal and impact angle for 104 m/s oblique impacts into sand. We find that the ejecta mass distribution is strongly sensitive to azimuthal angle with up to 8 times more mass in ejecta on the downrange side compared to the uprange side. Crater radii, measured from the site of impact, are measured at different impact and azimuthal angles. Crater ejecta scaling laws are modified to depend on azimuthal and impact angle. We find that crater radii are sensitive to both impact and azimuthal angle but the ejecta mass as a function of both angles can be estimated from the cube of the crater radius without an additional angular dependent function. The ejecta distributions are relevant for processes that depend upon the integrated properties of intermediate velocity impacts occurring in the outer solar system and possibly during planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>The MOPYS project: A survey of 70 planets in search of extended He I and H atmospheres. No evidence of enhanced evaporation in young planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the first Gyr of their life, exoplanet atmospheres suffer from different atmospheric escape phenomena that can strongly affect the shape and morphology of the exoplanet itself. These processes can be studied with Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$ and/or He I triplet observations. We present high-resolution spectroscopy observations from CARMENES and GIARPS checking for He I and H$\alpha$ signals in 20 exoplanetary atmospheres: V1298Tau c, K2-100b, HD63433b, HD63433c, HD73583b, HD73583c, K2-77b, TOI-2076b, TOI-2048b, HD235088b, TOI-1807b, TOI-1136d, TOI-1268b, TOI-1683b, TOI-2018b, MASCARA-2b, WASP-189b, TOI-2046b, TOI-1431b, and HAT-P-57b. We report two new high-resolution spectroscopy He I detections for TOI-1268b and TOI-2018b, and an H$\alpha$ detection for TOI-1136d. The MOPYS (Measuring Out-flows in Planets orbiting Young Stars) project aims to understand the evaporating phenomena and test their predictions from the current observations. We compiled a list of 70 exoplanets with He I and/or H$\alpha$ observations, from this work and the literature, and we considered the He I and H$\alpha$ results as proxy for atmospheric escape. Our principal results are that 0.1-1Gyr-old planets do not exhibit more He I or H$\alpha$ detections than older planets, and evaporation signals are more frequent for planets orbiting $\sim$1-3Gyr-old stars. We provide new constrains to the cosmic shoreline, the empirical division between rocky planets and planets with atmosphere, by using the evaporation detections and explore the capabilities of a new dimensionless parameter, $R_{\rm He}/R_{\rm Hill}$, to explain the He I triplet detections. Furthermore, we present a statistically significant upper boundary for the He I triplet detections in the $T_{\rm eq}$ vs $\rho_{\rm p}$ parameter space. Planets located above that boundary are unlikely to show He I absorption signals.</description>

      <title>Phase and morphology of water-ice grains formed in a cryogenic laboratory plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grains of ice are formed spontaneously when water vapor is injected into a weakly-ionized laboratory plasma in which the background gas has been cooled to cryogenic temperatures comparable to those of deep space. These ice grains are levitated indefinitely within the plasma so that their time evolution can be observed under free-floating conditions. Using microscope imaging, ice grains are shown to have a spindle-like fractal structure and grow over time. Both crystalline and amorphous phases of ice are observed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A mix of crystalline and amorphous grains coexist under certain thermal conditions and a linear mixing model is used on the ice absorption band surrounding 3.2 microns to examine the ice phase composition and its temporal stability. The extinction spectrum is also affected by inelastic scattering as grains grow, and characteristic grain radii are obtained from Mie scattering theory and compared to size measurements from direct imaging. Observations are used to compare possible ice nucleation mechanisms, and it is concluded that nucleation is likely catalyzed by ions, as ice does not nucleate in absence of plasma and impurities are not detected. Ice grain properties and infrared extinction spectra show similarity to observations of some astrophysical ices observed in protoplanetary disks, implying that the fractal morphology of the ice and observed processes of homogeneous ice nucleation could occur as well in such astrophysical environments with weakly-ionized conditions.</description>

      <title>An efficient approach for searching three-body periodic orbits passing through Eulerian configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new efficient approach for searching three-body periodic equal-mass collisionless orbits passing through Eulerian configuration is presented. The approach is based on a symmetry property of the solutions at the half period. Depending on two previously established symmetry types on the shape sphere, each solution is presented by one or two distinct initial conditions (one or two points in the search domain). A numerical search based on Newton's method on a relatively coarse search grid for solutions with relatively small scale-invariant periods $T^{*}&lt;70$ is conducted. The linear systems at each Newton's iteration are computed by high order high precision Taylor series method. The search produced 12,431 initial conditions (i.c.s) corresponding to 6,333 distinct solutions. In addition to passing through the Eulerian configuration, 35 of the solutions are also free-fall ones. Although most of the found solutions are new, all linearly stable solutions among them (only 7) are old ones. Particular attention is paid to the details of the high precision computations and the analysis of accuracy. All i.c.s are given with 100 correct digits.</description>

      <title>Long-term stellar activity of M dwarfs: A combined K2 and TESS study of two early M-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of the rotation and activity of M type stars are essential to enhance our understanding of stellar dynamos and angular momentum evolution. Using the outstanding photometric capabilities of space telescopes rotation signals even with low amplitudes can be investigated in up to now unrivaled detail. By combining data of K2 and the TESS prime mission the star spot activity of M dwarfs can be monitored on half a decade timescale. In the framework of our study on the rotation-activity relation for bright and nearby M dwarfs we also aim at an investigation of the long-term activity. While K2 was observing fields distributed around the ecliptic plane, the TESS prime mission was oriented along a line of ecliptic longitude with one camera centered on an ecliptic pole. Due to these different observing strategies, the overlap between K2 and the TESS prime mission is marginal. However, 45 stars from our sample were observed with both missions of which two early M-type stars that fulfill our selection criteria, EPIC 202059229 and EPIC 245919787, were analyzed in more detail. We found that for both stars the rotation period did not change while the rotational phase did change for EPIC 245919787 by ~0.2. The amplitude of the spot induced variability changed for both stars but more significant for EPIC 245919787. By comparing the cumulative flare frequency distributions we found that the flare activity for EPIC 202059229 is unchanged while it slightly changes for EPIC 245919787 between the K2 and TESS epochs. Using a combination of light curves from K2 and TESS that span a baseline up to 4.5 years we could measure significant differential rotation for EPIC 245919787. Furthermore, we show that combining missions like K2 and TESS is a promising method for detecting stellar activity cycles.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Solar Center-to-Limb Radial-Velocity Variability with SDO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar photospheric inhomogeneities are a significant source of noise which currently precludes the discovery of Earth-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars with the radial-velocity (RV) method. To complement several previous studies which have used ground- and spaced-based facilities to characterize the RV of the Sun, we here characterize the center-to-limb variability (CLV) of solar RVs arising from various solar-surface inhomogeneities observed by SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA. By using various SDO observables to classify pixels and calculate line-of-sight velocities as a function of pixel classification and limb angle, we show that each identified feature type, including the umbrae and penumbrae of sunspots, quiet-Sun magnetoconvective cells, magnetic network, and plage, exhibit distinct and complex CLV signatures, including a notable limb-angle dependence in the observed suppression of convective blueshift for magnetically active regions. We discuss the observed distributions of velocities by identified region type and limb angle, offer interpretations of the physical phenomena that shape these distributions, and emphasize the need to understand the RV signatures of these regions as astrophysical signals, rather than simple (un)correlated noise processes.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Retrievals of the Phase-resolved Spectra of Irradiated Brown Dwarfs WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B</title>

Abstract: We present an atmospheric retrieval analysis of HST/WFC3/G141 spectroscopic phase curve observations of two brown dwarfs, WD-0137B and EPIC-2122B, in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarf hosts. These systems are analogous to hot and ultra-hot Jupiter systems, enabling a unique and high-precision comparison to exoplanet systems. We use the PETRA retrieval suite to test various analysis setups, including joint-phase retrievals, multiple temperature structures, and non-uniform abundances. We find that WD-0137B has a dayside that closely resembles that of other ultra-hot Jupiters with inverted temperature structures and H$^-$ opacity, but quickly transitions to a mostly non-inverted temperature structure on the nightside. Meanwhile, EPIC-2122B's atmosphere remains inverted at all constrained longitudes, with dominant H$^-$ opacity. Retrievals with multiple temperature profiles and non-uniform vertical abundances were generally not statistically justified for this dataset, but retrievals with dayside-dilution factors were found to be justified. Retrieving all phases simultaneously with a linear combination of a dayside and nightside atmosphere was found to be an adequate representation of the entire phase-curve once a longitudinal temperature gradient free parameter was included in the retrieval. Comparing to global circulation models, we attribute behavior in the 1D retrievals to the inclined viewing geometry of the systems, which results in always-visible irradiated and inverted portions of the atmosphere "contaminating" spectra measured from the nightside hemisphere. This study sheds light on the similarities between these irradiated brown dwarf systems and hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, but also their unique differences, including the influence of the inclined viewing geometry.</description>

      <title>Structure-dependent fragmentation risk of rubble-pile asteroids on low-impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deflection of stray asteroids by low-momentum impacts is an Earth's key defense strategy. Using a proof-of-principle numerical model, we show that even such impacts on rubble pile asteroids (RPAs) may lead to fragmentation because of inherent internal stress chains. Such chains occur in three- and two-dimensional (2D) aggregates and we study this phenomenon in 2D. We first establish the existence of stress chains in our aggregates and then show that the dynamic shear stress and displacements are highest along the chains, increasing significantly the risk of fracturing there. Our simulations suggest that this phenomenon is independent of the aggregate's particle size distribution. We conclude that future studies are needed to quantitatively assess fragmentation risk as a function of stress chain statistics in RPAs.</description>

      <title>A Population Analysis of 20 Exoplanets Observed from the Optical to the Near-infrared Wavelengths with HST: Evidence for Widespread Stellar Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a population study of 20 exoplanets, ranging from Neptune-like to inflated hot-Jupiter planets, observed during transit with the STIS and WFC3 instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. To obtain spectral information from the near-UV to the near-infrared, we reanalysed sixteen WFC3 and over fifty STIS archival data sets with our dedicated HST pipeline. We also include twenty-four WFC3 data sets previously reduced with the same software. Across our target sample we observe significant divergence among multiple observations conducted with the same STIS grating at various epochs, whilst we do not detect variations in the WFC3 data sets. These results are suggestive of stellar contamination, which we have investigated further using known Bayesian tools and other tailored metrics, facilitating a more objective assessment of stellar activity intensity within each system. Our findings reveal that stellar activity contaminates up to half of the studied exoplanet atmospheres, albeit at varying extents. Accounting for stellar activity can significantly alter planetary atmospheric parameters like molecular abundances (up to 6 orders of magnitude) and temperature (up to 145 %), contrasting with the results of analyses that neglect activity. Our results emphasise the importance of considering the effects of stellar contamination in exoplanet transit studies; this issue is particularly true for data sets obtained with facilities that do not cover the optical and/or UV spectral range where the activity is expected to be more impactful but also more easily detectable. Our results also provide a catalogue of potentially active stars for further investigation and monitoring.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first towards and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

      <title>Fingering convection in a spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use 123 three dimensional direct numerical simulations to study fingering convection in non-rotating spherical shells. We investigate the scaling behaviour of the flow lengthscale, the non-dimensional heat and compositional fluxes $Nu$ and $Sh$ and the mean convective velocity over the fingering convection instability domain defined by $1 \leq R_\rho &lt; Le$, $R_\rho$ being the ratio of density perturbations of thermal and compositional origins and $Le$ the Lewis number. We show that the chemical boundary layers are marginally unstable and adhere to the laminar Prandtl-Blasius model, hence explaining the asymmetry between the inner and outer spherical shell boundary layers. We develop scaling laws for two asymptotic regimes close to the two edges of the instability domain, namely $R_\rho \lesssim Le$ and $R_\rho \gtrsim 1$. For the former, we develop novel power laws of a small parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the distance to onset, which differ from theoretical laws published to date in Cartesian geometry. For the latter, we find that the Sherwood number $Sh$ gradually approaches a scaling $Sh\sim Ra_\xi^{1/3}$ when $Ra_\xi \gg 1$; and that the P\'eclet number accordingly follows $Pe \sim Ra_\xi^{2/3} |Ra_T|^{-1/4}$, $Ra_\xi$ being the chemical Rayleigh number. When the Reynolds number exceeds a few tens, we report on a secondary instability which takes the form of large-scale toroidal jets which span the entire spherical domain. Jets distort the fingers resulting in Reynolds stress correlations, which in turn feed the jet growth until saturation. This nonlinear phenomenon can yield relaxation oscillation cycles.</description>
