      <title>Finite size corrections in the bulk for circular $\beta$ ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular $\beta$ ensemble for $\beta =1,2$ and 4 corresponds to circular orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensemble respectively as introduced by Dyson. The statistical state of the eigenvalues is then a determinantal point process ($\beta = 2$) and Pfaffian point process ($\beta = 1,4$). The explicit functional forms of the correlation kernels then imply that the general $n$-point correlation functions exhibit an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$, which moreover can be lifted to an asymptotic in $1/N^2$ for the spacing distributions and their generating function. We use $\sigma$-Painlev\'e characterisations to show that the functional form of the first correction is related to the leading term via a second derivative. Explicit functional forms are used to show that the spectral form factors for $\beta =1,2$ and 4 also admit an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$. Differential relations are identified expressing the first and second correction in terms of the limiting functional form, and evidence is presented that they hold for general $\beta$. For even $\beta$ it is proved that the two-point correlation function permits an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$, and moreover that the leading correction relates to the limiting functional form via a second derivative.</description>

      <title>Connection Between the Exact Moving Solutions of the Negative Korteweg-de Vries (nKdV) Equation and the Negative Modified Korteweg-de Vries (nmKdV) Equation and the Static Solutions of 1+1 Dimensional $\phi^4$ Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negative order KdV (nKdV) and the modified KdV (nmKdV) equations have two different formulations based on different hierarchy operators. Both equations can be written in terms of a nonlinear differential equation for a field $u(x,t)$ which we call the ``Lou form" of the equation. We find that for moving solutions of the nKdV equation and the nmKdV equation written in the ``Lou form" with $u(x,t) \rightarrow u (x-ct)= u(\xi) $, the equation for $u(\xi)$ can be mapped to the equation for the static solutions of the 1+1 dimensional $\phi^4$ field theory. Using this mapping we obtain a large number of solutions of the nKdV and the nmKdV equation, most of which are new. We also show that the nKdV equation can be derived from an Action Principle for both of its formulations. Furthermore, for both forms of the nmKdV equations as well as for both focusing and defocusing cases, we show that with a suitable ansatz one can decouple the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the nmKdV field $u(x,t)$ and obtain novel solutions in all the cases. We also obtain novel rational solutions of both the nKdV and the nmKdV equations.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Definition of Space via Dynamical Evolution and Observational Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a constructive and dynamical redefinition of spatial structure, grounded in the interplay between mechanical evolution and observational acts. Rather than presupposing space as a static background, we interpret space as an emergent entity that arises through observational acts. Using the framework of pre-topologies, measurable structures, and the GNS construction, we analyze how the choice of observables and the system's time evolution dynamically determine the topological and measure-theoretic features of space. This approach highlights the observer-dependent and context-sensitive nature of spatial concepts in both classical and quantum domains.</description>

      <title>Background fields in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parameterised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.</description>

      <title>A Topological and Operator Algebraic Framework for Asynchronous Lattice Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I introduce a novel mathematical framework integrating topological dynamics, operator algebras, and ergodic geometry to study lattices of asynchronous metric dynamical systems. Each node in the lattice carries an internal flow represented by a one-parameter family of operators, evolving on its own time scale. I formalize stratified state spaces capturing multiple levels of synchronized behavior, define an asynchronous evolution metric that quantifies phase-offset distances between subsystems, and characterize emergent coherent topologies arising when subsystems synchronize. Within this framework, I develop formal operators for the evolution of each subsystem and give precise conditions under which phase-aligned synchronization occurs across the lattice. The main results include: (1) the existence and uniqueness of coherent (synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, (2) stability of these coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase transition in a continuous operator topology, and (3) the influence of symmetries, with group-invariant coupling leading to flow-invariant synchrony subspaces and structured cluster dynamics. Proofs are given for each theorem, demonstrating full mathematical rigor. In a final section, I discuss hypothetical applications of this framework to symbolic lattice systems (e.g. subshifts), to invariant group actions on dynamical lattices, and to operator fields over stratified manifolds in the spirit of noncommutative geometry. Throughout, I write in the first person to emphasize the exploratory nature of this work. The paper avoids any reference to cosmology or observers, focusing instead on clean, formal mathematics suitable for a broad array of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>

Abstract: We provide few remarks on nonlinear Landau damping that concerns decay of the electric field in the classical Vlasov-Poisson system near spatially homogenous equilibria. In particular, this includes the analyticity framework, \`a la Grenier-Nguyen-Rodnianski, for non specialists, treating the analytic case studied by Mouhot-Villani, among other remarks for plasmas confined on a torus and in the whole space.</description>

      <title>Multiple phase estimation with photon-added multi-mode coherent states of GHZ-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores multiparameter quantum metrology using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-type photon-added coherent states (PACS) and investigates both independent and simultaneous parameter estimation with linear and non-linear protocols, highlighting the significant potential of quantum resources to enhance precision in multiparameter scenarios. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we explicitly derive analytical expressions for the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) for each protocol. Additionally, we compare the two estimation strategies, examining the behavior of their QCRBs and offering insights into the advantages and limitations of these quantum states in various contexts. Our results show that simultaneous estimation generally outperforms independent estimation, particularly in non-linear protocols. Furthermore, we analyze how the QCRB varies with the coherent state amplitude $|\alpha|^2$, the number of estimated parameters $d$, and the photon excitation order $n$ across three protocols. The results indicate that increasing $|\alpha|^2$ and decreasing $d$ improves estimation precision. For low $n$, the variation in the QCRB is similar for both symmetric and antisymmetric cases; however, at higher $n$, the antisymmetric case exhibits slightly better precision. The dependence on $d$ is comparable for both types of states. We also compare PACS-based GHZ states with NOON states and entangled coherent states, demonstrating the relative performance of each. Finally, we conclude with an analysis of homodyne detection in the context of a linear protocol, discussing its impact on estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Gauge transformations on quantum principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We understand quantum principal bundle as faithfully flat Hopf--Galois extensions, with a structure Hopf algebra coacting on a total space algebra and with base algebra given by the coinvariant elements. To endow such bundles with a compatible differential structure, one requires the coaction to extend as a morphism of differential graded algebras. This leads to an exact noncommutative Atiyah sequence, a graded Hopf--Galois extension of differential forms and a canonical braiding on total space forms such that the latter are graded-braided commutative. We recall this approach to noncommutative differential geometry and further discuss the extension of quantum gauge transformations, in the sense of Brzezi\'nski, to differential forms. In this way we obtain an action of quantum gauge transformations on connections of the quantum principal bundle and their curvature. Explicit examples, such as the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and smash product algebras are discussed.</description>

      <title>Koopman analysis of CAT maps onto classical and quantum 2-tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical continuous automorphisms of the torus (CAT maps) from the viewpoint of the Koopman theory. We find analytical formulae for Koopman modes defined coherently on the whole of the torus, and their decompositions associated with the partition of the torus into ergodic components. The spectrum of the Koopman operator is studied in four cases of CAT maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical (transition from quasi-cyclic to chaotic behaviour) and chaotic. We generalise these results to quantum CAT maps defined onto a noncommutative torus (and on its dual space). Finally, we study usual quantum chaos indicators onto quantum CAT maps from the viewpoint of the Koopman picture. The analogy with the classical case suggests that couples of these indicators are in fact necessary to certify a quantum chaotic behaviour.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanically admissible definitions of the factor $\exp\big[(i/\hbar)S(\gamma)\big]$ in the Feynman integral are put in bijection with the prequantisations of Kostant and Souriau. The different allowed expressions of this factor -- the inequivalent prequantisations -- are classified. The theory is illustrated by the Aharonov-Bohm experiment and by identical particles.</description>

Abstract: We consider a planar Coulomb gas ensemble of size $N$ with the inverse temperature $\beta=2$ and external potential $Q(z)=|z|^2-2c \log|z-a|$, where $c&gt;0$ and $a \in \mathbb{C}$. Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$ eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \times (c+1) N$ conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$. Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition: it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the partial Schlesinger transform.</description>

Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film in which electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being 300 times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree- Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external time-dependent electric potentials, such as those induced by local charge defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. In the case of nearest neighbor hoppings, this model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time and fermion number, with in particular two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. In this paper we study the analogous picture in the presence of a next nearest interactions. In particular, we discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile. We also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find a novel higher order tacnode kernel governing them.</description>

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study nonlinear superpositions of Riemann wave solutions admitted by quasilinear hyperbolic first-order systems of partial differential equations. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of non-elastic wave superpositions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise independent interactions of waves (quasi-rectifiability). In the case of the compressible Euler system, we describe the structure of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields associated with waves. We prove that a certain class of Lie modules associated with a hydrodynamic-type systems can be uniquely transformed into a real Lie algebra in an angle-preserving manner. For the Euler system, we then demonstrate the connection between the transformed finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the infinite-dimensional algebra associated with waves. This enables a detailed investigation of the geometry of wave superpositions using tools from differential geometry and Lie group theory. In particular, we study the geometry of the manifold of wave superpositions in terms of deformations of submanifolds corresponding to Lie subalgebras associated with waves. Additionally, we present new methods and criteria for determining the quasi-rectifiability of Riemann k-waves.</description>

Abstract: For a plane gravitational wave whose profile is given, in Brinkmann coordinates, by a $2\times2$ symmetric traceless matrix $K(U)$, the matrix Sturm-Liouville equation $\ddot{P}=KP$ plays a multiple and central r\^ole: (i) it determines the isometries, (ii) it appears as the key tool for switching from Brinkmann to BJR coordinates and vice versa, (iii) it determines the trajectories of particles initially at rest. All trajectories can be obtained from trivial "Carrollian" ones by a suitable action of the (broken) Carrollian isometry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.01436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kepler's rescaling becomes, when "Eisenhart-Duval lifted" to $5$-dimensional "Bargmann" gravitational wave spacetime, an ordinary spacetime symmetry for motion along null geodesics, which are the lifts of Keplerian trajectories. The lifted rescaling generates a well-behaved conserved Noether charge upstairs, which takes an unconventional form when expressed in conventional terms. This conserved quantity seems to have escaped attention so far. Applications include the Virial Theorem and also Kepler's Third Law. The lifted Kepler rescaling is a Chrono-Projective transformation. The results extend to celestial mechanics and Newtonian Cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.00838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bialynicki-Birula and Charzynski argued that a gravitational wave emitted during the merger of a black hole binary may be approximated by a circularly polarized wave which may in turn trap particles [1]. In this paper we consider particle motion in a class of gravitational waves which includes, besides circularly polarized periodic waves (CPP) [2], also the one proposed by Lukash [3] to study anisotropic cosmological models. Both waves have a 7-parameter conformal symmetry which contains, in addition to the generic 5-parameter (broken) Carroll group, also a 6th isometry. The Lukash spacetime can be transformed by a conformal rescaling of time to a perturbed CPP problem. Bounded geodesics, found both analytically and numerically, arise when the Lukash wave is of Bianchi type VI. Their symmetries can also be derived from the Lukash-CPP relation. Particle trapping is discussed.</description>

      <title>Isospin precession in non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of pseudoclassical isospin is illustrated by the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect proposed by Wu and Yang in 1975. The spatial motion is free however the isospin precesses when the enclosed magnetic flux and the incoming particle's isosopin are not parallel. The non-Abelian phase factor $\mathfrak{F}$ of Wu and Yang acts on the isospin as an S-matrix. The scattering becomes side-independent when the enclosed flux is quantized, ${\Phi}_N=N\Phi_0$ with $N$ an integer. The gauge group $SU(2)$ is an internal symmetry and generates conserved charges only when the flux is quantized, which then splits into two series: for $N=2k$ $SU(2)$ acts trivially but for $N=1+2k$ the implementation is twisted. The orbital and the internal angular momenta are separately conserved. The double rotational symmetry is broken to $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ when $N$ odd. For unquantized flux there are no internal symmetries, the charge is not conserved and protons can be turned into neutrons.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial chiral algebras of self-dual black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits.</description>

      <title>Towards new relativistic doubly $\kappa$-deformed D=4 quantum phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new noncommutative models of quantum phase spaces, containing a pair of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebras, with two independent double ($\kappa,\tilde{\kappa}$)-deformations in space-time and four-momenta sectors. The first such quantum phase space can be obtained by contractions $M,R\to \infty$ of recently introduced doubly $\kappa$-deformed $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-Yang models, with the parameters $M,R$ describing inverse space-time and four-momenta curvatures and constant four-vectors $a_\mu, b_\mu$ determining nine types of $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-deformations. The second considered model is provided by the nonlinear doubly $\kappa$-deformed TSR algebra spanned by 14 coset $\hat{o}(1,5)/\hat {o}(2)$ generators. The basic algebraic difference between the two models is the following: the first one, described by $\hat{o}(1,5)$ Lie algebra can be supplemented by the Hopf algebra structure, while the second model contains the quantum phase space commutators $[\hat{x}_\mu,\hat{q}_\nu]$, with the standard numerical $i\hbar\eta_{\mu\nu}$ term; therefore it describes the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebra relations which cannot be equipped with the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Poincare field theory for massless particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our main proposition is that field equations for all spins can be obtained from Casimir eigenvalue equations for Poincare group. We have already confirm that statement for massive scalar, spinor and vector fields in Ref.[1]. In the present article we are going to confirm this statement for massless vector, second and fourth rang tensor fields. In particular we will obtain Maxwell equations and Einstein equation in weak field approximation.
  As is well known, Wigner define a particles as irreducible representation of Poincare group [2,3]. But, as Weinberg noted in [4] irreducible representations for massless vector field with helicities $\pm 1$ do not exist. In the present article we will conform this statement for a wide class of massless fields. They are not Lorentz invariant since their Lorentz transformations have additional term in the form of gauge transformations. Such fields can appear in the theory only in the form which do not depend on corresponding gauge parameters. These forms are our equations of motion and they are by definition gauge invariant. So, the massless case is significantly different from massive one. In the end we will show that our approach can reproduce main contributions from well known articles with highest helicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to identify the limit in a high temperature regime of classical beta ensembles on the real line and related eigenvalue processes by using the Markov--Krein transform. We show that the limiting measure of Gaussian beta ensembles (resp.\ beta Laguerre ensembles and beta Jacobi ensembles) is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of the Gaussian distribution (resp.\ the gamma distribution and the beta distribution). At the process level, we show that the limiting probability measure-valued process is the inverse Markov--Krein transform of a certain 1d stochastic process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>Tunnels Under Geometries (or Instantons Know Their Algebras)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tight binding model with multiple degenerate vacua we might treat wave function overlaps as instanton tunnelings between different wells (vacua). An amplitude for such a tunneling process might be constructed as $\mathsf{T}_{i\to j}\sim e^{-S_{\mathrm{ inst}}}{\mathbf{v}}_j^{+}{\mathbf{v}}_i^{-}$, where there is canonical instanton action suppression, and $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$ annihilates a particle in the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum, whereas $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ creates a particle in the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum. Adiabatic change of the wells leads to a Berry-phase evolution of the couplings, which is described by the zero-curvature Gauss-Manin connection i.e. by a quantum $R$-matrix. Zero-curvature is actually a consequence of level repulsion or topological protection, and its implication is the Yang-Baxter relation for the $R$-matrices. In the simplest case the story is pure Abelian and not very exciting. But when the model becomes more involved, incorporates supersymmetry, gauge and other symmetries, such amplitudes obtain more intricate structures. Operators $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$, $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ might also evolve from ordinary Heisenberg operators into a more sophisticated algebraic object -- a ``tunneling algebra''. The result for the tunneling algebra would depend strongly on geometry of the QFT we started with, and, unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to solve the reverse engineering problem. In this note we revise few successful cases of the aforementioned correspondence: quantum algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ and affine Yangians $Y(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. For affine Yangians we demonstrate explicitly how instantons ``perform'' equivariant integrals over associated quiver moduli spaces appearing in the alternative geometric construction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of quantum measurements remains contested between collapse-based frameworks like the Copenhagen Interpretation and no-collapse approaches like the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI). We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) as a minimalist alternative that preserves unitarity while avoiding both wavefunction collapse and ontological excess. BHSI models measurement as the unitary branching of a system's local Hilbert space into decoherent subspaces, formalized through causal state updates using branching and disengaging operators. Unlike MWI, BHSI avoids parallel worlds by maintaining a single-world ontology in which branching is confined to observable subspaces; unlike Copenhagen, it eliminates collapse while recovering the Born rule through branch weights. Through physically meaningful subspace records, the framework resolves quantum paradoxes such as particle-wave duality, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, etc. It remains consistent with interference patterns, entanglement correlations, and information preservation. By comparing BHSI with QBism, Relational Quantum Mechanics, and modal interpretations, as well as analyzing quantum teleportation (where locally decoherent Hilbert subspaces are observed), we demonstrate its advantages as a causally sound and empirically grounded approach that reconciles unitary evolution with definite measurement outcomes without metaphysical proliferation.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>
