      <title>qSAT: Design of an Efficient Quantum Satisfiability Solver for Hardware Equivalence Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver for hardware verification incurs exponential run-time in several instances. In this work we have proposed an efficient quantum SAT (qSAT) solver for equivalence checking of Boolean circuits employing Grover's algorithm. The Exclusive-Sum-of-Product based generation of the Conjunctive Normal Form equivalent clauses demand less qubits and minimizes the gates and depth of quantum circuit interpretation. The consideration of reference circuits for verification affecting Grover's iterations and quantum resources are also presented as a case study. Experimental results are presented assessing the benefits of the proposed verification approach using open-source Qiskit platform and IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Quantum multi-row iteration algorithm for linear systems with non-square coefficient matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04010v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of quantum linear system algorithms, quantum computing has realized exponential computational advantages over classical computing. However, the focus has been on square coefficient matrices, with few quantum algorithms addressing non-square matrices. Towards this kind of problems defined by $ Ax = b $ where $ A $$ \in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $, we propose a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical multi-row iteration method and provide an explicit quantum circuit based on the quantum comparator and Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM). The time complexity of our quantum multi-row iteration algorithm is $ O(K \log m) $, with $ K $ representing the number of iteration steps, which demonstrates an exponential speedup compared to the classical version. Based on the convergence of the classical multi-row iteration algorithm, we prove that our quantum algorithm converges faster than the quantum one-row iteration algorithm presented in [Phys. Rev. A, 101, 022322 (2020)]. Moreover, our algorithm places less demand on the coefficient matrix, making it suitable for solving inconsistent systems and quadratic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Fast Adaptation for Deep Learning-based Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration with artificial intelligence (AI) is recognized as one of the six usage scenarios in next-generation wireless communications. However, several critical challenges hinder the widespread application of deep learning (DL) techniques in wireless communications. In particular, existing DL-based wireless communications struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing wireless environments. In this paper, we discuss fast adaptation for DL-based wireless communications by using few-shot learning (FSL) techniques. We first identify the differences between fast adaptation in wireless communications and traditional AI tasks by highlighting two distinct FSL design requirements for wireless communications. To establish a wide perspective, we present a comprehensive review of the existing FSL techniques in wireless communications that satisfy these two design requirements. In particular, we emphasize the importance of applying domain knowledge in achieving fast adaptation. We specifically focus on multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) precoding as an examples to demonstrate the advantages of the FSL to achieve fast adaptation in wireless communications. Finally, we highlight several open research issues for achieving broadscope future deployment of fast adaptive DL in wireless communication applications.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Design Methodology for Control, Simulation, and Monitoring of Fluidic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a synthesis method for the design of digital twins applicable to various systems (pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical/electronic circuits). The methodology allows representing the operation of these systems through an active digital twin, thereby enabling a more suitable and easier computer-aided design, simulation, control, and monitoring. Furthermore, our methodology enables the detection of a system's actions on its own inputs (for example, in pneumatics: backflow of gases trapped in part of a fluidic system onto its own inputs). During the simulation or monitoring phase, the approach also facilitates real-time diagnosis of the controlled system. The outputs, on the controlled physical system or its digital twin, do not depend only on the current inputs but also on the history of the inputs and the history of internal states and variables. In other words, the underlying sequential logic has a memory while an only combinational logic approach does not. These capabilities can contribute to the digital transformation of the factory of the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing: Vision and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many complex problems that cannot be solved otherwise with conventional computing methods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, chemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable progress in quantum software and algorithm creation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the prospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.</description>
