      <title>DBOS Network Sensing: A Web Services Approach to Collaborative Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DBOS (DataBase Operating System) is a novel capability that integrates web services, operating system functions, and database features to significantly reduce web-deployment effort while increasing resilience. Integration of high performance network sensing enables DBOS web services to collaboratively create a shared awareness of their network environments to enhance their collective resilience and security. Network sensing is added to DBOS using GraphBLAS hypersparse traffic matrices via two approaches: (1) Python-GraphBLAS and (2) OneSparse PostgreSQL. These capabilities are demonstrated using the workflow and analytics from the IEEE/MIT/Amazon Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge. The system was parallelized using pPython and benchmarked using 64 compute nodes on the MIT SuperCloud. The web request rate sustained by a single DBOS instance was ${&gt;}10^5$, well above the required maximum, indicating that network sensing can be added to DBOS with negligible overhead. For collaborative awareness, many DBOS instances were connected to a single DBOS aggregator. The Python-GraphBLAS and OneSparse PostgreSQL implementations scaled linearly up to 64 and 32 nodes respectively. These results suggest that DBOS collaborative network awareness can be achieved with a negligible increase in computing resources.</description>

      <title>Taming Volatility: Stable and Private QUIC Classification with Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for privacy-preserving network traffic analysis, but its practical deployment is challenged by the non-IID nature of real-world data. While prior work has addressed statistical heterogeneity, the impact of temporal traffic volatility-the natural daily ebb and flow of network activity-on model stability remains largely unexplored. This volatility can lead to inconsistent data availability at clients, destabilizing the entire training process. In this paper, we systematically address the problem of temporal volatility in federated QUIC classification. We first demonstrate the instability of standard FL in this dynamic setting. We then propose and evaluate a client-side data buffer as a practical mechanism to ensure stable and consistent local training, decoupling it from real-time traffic fluctuations. Using the real-world CESNET-QUIC22 dataset partitioned into 14 autonomous clients, we then demonstrate that this approach enables robust convergence. Our results show that a stable federated system achieves a 95.2% F1 score, a mere 2.3 percentage points below a non-private centralized model. This work establishes a blueprint for building operationally stable FL systems for network management, proving that the challenges of dynamic network environments can be overcome with targeted architectural choices.</description>

      <title>Service Function Chaining Architecture for Multi-hop Split Inference and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a networking technique that ensures traffic traverses a predefined sequence of service functions, realizing arbitrary network services through dynamic and efficient communication paths. Inspired by this concept, we propose an SFC-based architecture for Multi-hop Split Inference (MSI), where split sub-models are interpreted as service functions and their composition forms a service chain representing the global model. By leveraging SFC, the proposed architecture dynamically establishes communication paths for split sub-models, ensuring efficient and adaptive execution. Furthermore, we extend this architecture to Multi-hop Split Learning (MSL) by applying SFC to the bidirectional communication required for training tasks. To realize the proposed architecture, we design Neural Service Functions (NSFs) to execute split sub-models as transparent TCP proxies and integrate them with Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) and the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)-based SFC proxy. This integration ensures efficient ML processing over dynamic routing while maintaining compatibility with existing applications. Evaluation results demonstrate that (1) the proposed architecture is feasible for both MSI and MSL; (2) it is particularly suitable for real-time inference in MSI scenarios with small mini-batch sizes; (3) it supports dynamic path reconfiguration, enabling adaptive responses to changing network conditions while minimizing the impact of control mechanisms on inference and learning processes.</description>

      <title>Maximising Energy Efficiency in Large-Scale Open RAN: Hybrid xApps and Digital Twin Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for high-speed, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications in 5G and beyond networks has significantly driven up power consumption, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN). This surge in energy demand poses critical operational and sustainability challenges for mobile network operators, necessitating innovative solutions that enhance energy efficiency without compromising Quality of Service (QoS). Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), spearheaded by the O-RAN Alliance, offers disaggregated, programmable, and intelligent architectures, promoting flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. However, this disaggregated approach adds complexity, particularly in managing power consumption across diverse network components such as Open Radio Units (RUs). In this paper, we propose a hybrid xApp leveraging heuristic methods and unsupervised machine learning, integrated with digital twin technology through the TeraVM AI RAN Scenario Generator (AI-RSG). This approach dynamically manages RU sleep modes to effectively reduce energy consumption. Our experimental evaluation in a realistic, large-scale emulated Open RAN scenario demonstrates that the hybrid xApp achieves approximately 13% energy savings, highlighting its practicality and significant potential for real-world deployments without compromising user QoS.</description>

      <title>Secure and Scalable Rerouting in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilient routing in large-scale Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks remains a key challenge due to frequent and unpredictable link and node failures, potentially in response to cybersecurity breaches. While prior work has explored rerouting strategies with various levels of network awareness, their relative tradeoffs under dynamic failure conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we extend the Deep Space Network Simulator (DSNS) to systematically compare three rerouting paradigms, each differing in the scope of failure knowledge available to each node. We compare local neighbor-based, segment-based and global-knowledge-based rerouting as well as a naive source routing solution that is unaware of failures. Our main goal is to evaluate how the breadth of failure awareness impacts routing performance and resilience under failures, both random and targeted. We measure delivery ratio, latency, rerouting overhead, and loop occurrence. Our findings show the potential of segment-based rerouting to achieve a favorable tradeoff between local responsiveness and global coordination, offering resilience benefits with minimal overhead--insights that can inform future fault-tolerant satellite network design.</description>

      <title>Friend or Foe? Identifying Anomalous Peers in Moneros P2P Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monero, the leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency, relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to propagate transactions and blocks. Growing evidence suggests that non-standard nodes exist in the network, posing as honest nodes but are perhaps intended for monitoring the network and spying on other nodes. However, our understanding of the detection and analysis of anomalous peer behavior remains limited. This paper presents a first comprehensive study of anomalous behavior in Monero's P2P network. To this end, we collected and analyzed over 240 hours of network traffic captured from five distinct vantage points worldwide. We further present a formal framework which allows us to analytically define and classify anomalous patterns in P2P cryptocurrency networks. Our detection methodology, implemented as an offline analysis, provides a foundation for real-time monitoring systems. Our analysis reveals the presence of non-standard peers in the network where approximately 14.74% (13.19%) of (reachable) peers in the network exhibit non-standard behavior. These peers exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that might suggest multiple concurrent attacks, pointing to substantial shortcomings in Monero's privacy guarantees and network decentralization. To support reproducibility and enable network operators to protect themselves, we release our examination pipeline to identify and block suspicious peers based on newly captured network traffic.</description>

      <title>RFSeek and Ye Shall Find</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Requests for Comments (RFCs) are extensive specification documents for network protocols, but their prose-based format and their considerable length often impede precise operational understanding. We present RFSeek, an interactive tool that automatically extracts visual summaries of protocol logic from RFCs. RFSeek leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate provenance-linked, explorable diagrams, surfacing both official state machines and additional logic found only in the RFC text. Compared to existing RFC visualizations, RFSeek's visual summaries are more transparent and easier to audit against their textual source. We showcase the tool's potential through a series of use cases, including guided knowledge extraction and semantic diffing, applied to protocols such as TCP, QUIC, PPTP, and DCCP.
  In practice, RFSeek not only reconstructs the RFC diagrams included in some specifications, but, more interestingly, also uncovers important logic such as nodes or edges described in the text but missing from those diagrams. RFSeek further derives new visualization diagrams for complex RFCs, with QUIC as a representative case. Our approach, which we term \emph{Summary Visualization}, highlights a promising direction: combining LLMs with formal, user-customized visualizations to enhance protocol comprehension and support robust implementations.</description>

      <title>Trusted Repeater Placement in QKD-enabled Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security, but is limited by distance in optical networks, thereby requiring repeater nodes to extend coverage. Existing works usually assume all repeater nodes and associated Key Management Servers (KMSs) to be Trusted Repeater Nodes (TRNs), while ignoring risks from software exploits and insider threats. In this paper, we propose a reliability-aware TRN placement framework for metro optical networks, which assigns each node a trust score and integrates it into the Dijkstra algorithm via weighted links. We then rank the nodes using a composite score, which is a weighted combination of betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality to enable a secure and scalable TRN deployment. Simulation results on a reference topology show that our method covers 10.77% more shortest paths compared to traditional metrics like degree centrality, using the same number (around eight) of TRNs, making it suitable for TRN selection to maximize secure connectivity.</description>

      <title>Proof of AutoML: SDN based Secure Energy Trading with Blockchain in Disaster Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disaster scenarios where conventional energy infrastructure is compromised, secure and traceable energy trading between solar-powered households and mobile charging units becomes a necessity. To ensure the integrity of such transactions over a blockchain network, robust and unpredictable nonce generation is vital. This study proposes an SDN-enabled architecture where machine learning regressors are leveraged not for their accuracy, but for their potential to generate randomized values suitable as nonce candidates. Therefore, it is newly called Proof of AutoML. Here, SDN allows flexible control over data flows and energy routing policies even in fragmented or degraded networks, ensuring adaptive response during emergencies. Using a 9000-sample dataset, we evaluate five AutoML-selected regression models - Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors - not by their prediction accuracy, but by their ability to produce diverse and non-deterministic outputs across shuffled data inputs. Randomness analysis reveals that Random Forest and Extra Trees regressors exhibit complete dependency on randomness, whereas Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors and LightGBM show strong but slightly lower randomness scores (97.6%, 98.8% and 99.9%, respectively). These findings highlight that certain machine learning models, particularly tree-based ensembles, may serve as effective and lightweight nonce generators within blockchain-secured, SDN-based energy trading infrastructures resilient to disaster conditions.</description>

      <title>Realistic UE Antennas for 6G in the 3GPP Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to 6G has driven significant updates to the 3GPP channel model, particularly in modeling UE antennas and user-induced blockage for handheld devices. The 3GPP Rel.19 revision of TR 38.901 introduces a more realistic framework that captures directive antenna patterns, practical antenna placements, polarization effects, and element-specific blockage. These updates are based on high-fidelity simulations and measurements of a reference smartphone across multiple frequency ranges. By aligning link- and system-level simulations with real-world device behavior, the new model enables more accurate evaluation of 6G technologies and supports consistent performance assessment across industry and research.</description>

      <title>X5G: An Open, Programmable, Multi-vendor, End-to-end, Private 5G O-RAN Testbed with NVIDIA ARC and OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15935v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Fifth generation (5G) cellular systems transition to softwarized, programmable, and intelligent networks, it becomes fundamental to enable public and private 5G deployments that are (i) primarily based on software components while (ii) maintaining or exceeding the performance of traditional monolithic systems and (iii) enabling programmability through bespoke configurations and optimized deployments. This requires hardware acceleration to scale the Physical (PHY) layer performance, programmable elements in the Radio Access Network (RAN) and intelligent controllers at the edge, careful planning of the Radio Frequency (RF) environment, as well as end-to-end integration and testing. In this paper, we describe how we developed the programmable X5G testbed, addressing these challenges through the deployment of the first 8-node network based on the integration of NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA), OpenAirInterface (OAI), and a near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). The Aerial Software Development Kit (SDK) provides the PHY layer, accelerated on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), with the higher layers from the OAI open-source project interfaced with the PHY through the Small Cell Forum (SCF) Functional Application Platform Interface (FAPI). An E2 agent provides connectivity to the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) near-real-time RIC. We discuss software integration, network infrastructure, and a digital twin framework for RF planning. We then profile the performance with up to 4 Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) smartphones for each base station with iPerf and video streaming applications, as well as up to 25 emulated User Equipments (UEs), measuring a cell rate higher than 1.65 Gbps in downlink and 143 Mbps in uplink.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Application-Specific TCP Congestion-Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Congestion Control (CC) module plays a critical role in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), ensuring the stability and efficiency of network data transmission. The CC approaches that are commonly used these days employ heuristics-based rules to adjust the sending rate. Due to their heuristics-based nature, these approaches are not only unable to adapt to changing network conditions but are also agnostic to the diverse requirements that different applications often have. Recently, several learning-based CC approaches have been proposed to adapt to changing network conditions. Unfortunately, they are not designed to take application requirements into account. Prior heuristics-based as well as learning-based CC approaches focus on achieving a singular objective, which is often to maximize throughput, even though a lot of applications care more about latency, packet losses, jitter, and different combinations of various network metrics. Motivated by this, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based CC framework, namely ASC, which allows any application to specify any arbitrary objectives that the network traffic of that application should achieve and is able to swiftly adapt to the changes in the objectives of the applications as well as to the changes in the network conditions. Our ASC framework further employs a client-server architecture that serves two purposes: 1) it makes ASC highly scalable in terms of the arrival and departure of TCP connections, and 2) it makes ASC very lightweight for the nodes maintaining the TCP connections. We implemented and extensively evaluated ASC in a variety of settings. Our results show that it can not only achieve various objectives but also outperforms prior approaches even in the specific objectives that those approaches were designed to achieve.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Multimodal Token Transmission in Resource-Constrained Multiuser Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the promising paradigm enabled by integrating semantic communication (SemCom) with multimodal large models (MLMs) for transmitting and utilizing multimodal data, efficiently fusing and exploiting cross-modal information still remain challenging. Moreover, widely adopted transformer-based architectures inevitably produce excessively long token embeddings for transmission, which result in higher bandwidth consumption, increased power usage, and greater latency, rendering them impractical in resource-constrained networks. In this letter, we propose a task-oriented multimodal token transmission scheme for efficient multimodal information fusion and utilization. To improve inter-modal consistency and task-relevant token transmission, we design a two-stage training algotithm which involves cross-modal alignment followed by task-oriented fine-tuning. Meanwhile, token compression is performed using a sliding window pooling operation to conserve limited communication resources. To balance the trade-off between latency reduction and performance degradation caused by compression, we formulate a weighted-sum optimization problem over latency and inference performance. We jointly optimizes bandwidth, power allocation, and token length across users by using an alternating optimization method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline under different bandwidth and power budgets. Moreover, the two-stage training algorithm achieves higher accuracy across various signal-to-noise ratios than the method without cross-modal alignment.</description>

      <title>Fractality of Wireless Mesh Networks: Dimensional Effects on Network Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) depend on the spatial distribution of nodes, which directly influences connectivity, routing efficiency, and overall network performance. Conventional models typically assume uniform or random node placement, which inadequately represent the complex, hierarchical spatial patterns observed in practical deployments. In this study, we present a novel algorithm that constructs WMN topologies with tunable fractal dimensions, allowing precise control over spatial self-similarity. By systematically varying the fractal dimension, the algorithm generates network layouts spanning a continuum of spatial complexities, ranging from sparse fragmented clusters to dense, cohesive structures. Through NS-3 simulations, Key performance metrics including throughput, latency, jitter, and packet delivery ratio were evaluated across a range of fractal dimensions. Comparative evaluations against classical random, small-world, scale-free, grid and hierarchical tree networks models reveal that high-dimensional fractal topologies achieve enhanced resilience and throughput under equivalent conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fractal geometry as a design paradigm for scalable and efficient WMN architectures.</description>

Abstract: Consider people with smartphones operating without external authorities or global resources other than the network itself. In this setting, high-end applications supporting sovereign democratic digital communities, community banks, and digital cooperatives require consensus executed by community members, which must be reconfigurable to support community dynamics.
  The Constitutional Consensus protocol aims to address this need by introducing constitutional self-governance to consensus: participants dynamically amend the participant set, supermajority threshold, and timeout parameter through the consensus protocol itself. We achieve this by enhancing a DAG-based protocol (like Cordial Miners) with participant-controlled reconfiguration, while also supporting both high- and low-throughput operation (like Morpheus), remaining quiescent when idle. This three-way synthesis uniquely combines: (1) constitutional amendments for self-governance, (2) a cryptographic DAG structure for simplicity, parallelism, and throughput, and (3) both high- and low-throughput operation. The protocol achieves consensus in $3\delta$, maintains O(n) amortized communication complexity during high throughput, and seamlessly transitions between modes. The basic protocol (without constitutional amendments) realizes these features in 25 lines of pseudocode, making it one of the most concise consensus protocols for eventual synchrony.</description>
