      <title>Experimental Results for Vampire on the Equational Theories Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equational Theories Project is a collaborative effort, which explores the validity of certain first-order logic implications of certain kind. The project has been completed but triggered further research. This report investigates how much can be automatically proven and disproven by the automated theorem prover Vampire. An interesting conclusion is that Vampire can prove all the considered implications that hold and also is able to refute a vast majority of those that do not hold.</description>

      <title>Lean Meets Theoretical Computer Science: Scalable Synthesis of Theorem Proving Challenges in Formal-Informal Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems, which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning. Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4) and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated reasoning research.</description>

      <title>Disjunctions of Two Dependence Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependence logic is a formalism that augments the syntax of first-order logic with dependence atoms asserting that the value of a variable is determined by the values of some other variables, i.e., dependence atoms express functional dependencies in relational databases. On finite structures, dependence logic captures NP, hence there are sentences of dependence logic whose model-checking problem is NP-complete. In fact, it is known that there are disjunctions of three dependence atoms whose model-checking problem is NP-complete. Motivated from considerations in database theory, we study the model-checking problem for disjunctions of two unary dependence atoms and establish a trichotomy theorem, namely, for every such formula, one of the following is true for the model-checking problem: (i) it is NL-complete; (ii) it is LOGSPACE-complete; (iii) it is first-order definable (hence, in AC[0]). Furthermore, we classify the complexity of the model-checking problem for disjunctions of two arbitrary dependence atoms, and also characterize when such a disjunction is coherent, i.e., when it satisfies a certain small-model property. Along the way, we identify a new class of 2CNF-formulas whose satisfiability problem is LOGSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>A Reduction of Input/Output Logics to SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deontic logics are formalisms for reasoning over norms, obligations, permissions and prohibitions. Input/Output (I/O) Logics are a particular family of so-called norm-based deontic logics that formalize conditional norms outside of the underlying object logic language, where conditional norms do not carry a truth-value themselves. In this paper, an automation approach for I/O logics is presented that makes use of suitable reductions to (sequences of) propositional satisfiability problems. A prototypical implementation, named rio (reasoner for input/output logics), of the proposed procedures is presented and applied to illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Uppaal Coshy: Automatic Synthesis of Compact Shields for Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy -- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.</description>

      <title>Prover-Adversary games for systems over (non-deterministic) branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pudlak-Buss style Prover-Adversary games to characterise proof systems reasoning over deterministic branching programs (BPs) and non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs). Our starting points are the proof systems eLDT and eLNDT, for BPs and NBPs respectively, previously introduced by Buss, Das and Knop. We prove polynomial equivalences between these proof systems and the corresponding games we introduce. This crucially requires access to a form of negation of branching programs which, for NBPs, requires us to formalise a non-uniform version of the Immerman-Szelepcsenyi theorem that coNL = NL. Thanks to the techniques developed, we further obtain a proof complexity theoretic version of Immerman-Szelepcsenyi, showing that eLNDT is polynomially equivalent to systems over boundedly alternating branching programs.</description>

      <title>An order out of nowhere: a new algorithm for infinite-domain CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of satisfiability of sets of constraints in a given set of finite uniform hypergraphs. While the problem under consideration is similar in nature to the problem of satisfiability of constraints in graphs, the classical complexity reduction to finite-domain CSPs that was used in the proof of the complexity dichotomy for such problems cannot be used as a black box in our case. We therefore introduce an algorithmic technique inspired by classical notions from the theory of finite-domain CSPs, and prove its correctness based on symmetries that depend on a linear order that is external to the structures under consideration. Our second main result is a P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for such problems over many sets of uniform hypergraphs. The proof is based on the translation of the problem into the framework of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over infinite uniform hypergraphs. Our result confirms in particular the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture for CSPs of first-order reducts of many homogeneous hypergraphs including the random hypergraphs and hypergraphs omitting a generalised clique. This forms a vast generalisation of previous work by Bodirsky-Pinsker (STOC'11) and Bodirsky-Martin-Pinsker-Pongr\'acz (ICALP'16) on graph satisfiability.</description>

      <title>Peano Arithmetic and $\mu$MALL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal theories of arithmetic have traditionally been based on either classical or intuitionistic logic, leading to the development of Peano and Heyting arithmetic, respectively. We propose to use $\mu$MALL as a formal theory of arithmetic based on linear logic. This formal system is presented as a sequent calculus proof system that extends the standard proof system for multiplicative-additive linear logic (MALL) with the addition of the logical connectives universal and existential quantifiers (first-order quantifiers), term equality and non-equality, and the least and greatest fixed point operators. We first demonstrate how functions defined using $\mu$MALL relational specifications can be computed using a simple proof search algorithm. By incorporating weakening and contraction into $\mu$MALL, we obtain $\mu$LK+, a natural candidate for a classical sequent calculus for arithmetic. While important proof theory results are still lacking for $\mu$LK+ (including cut-elimination and the completeness of focusing), we prove that $\mu$LK+ is consistent and that it contains Peano arithmetic. We also prove some conservativity results regarding $\mu$LK+ over $\mu$MALL.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Inaccessible Sets in Martin-L\"{o}f Type Theory with One Mahlo Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rathjen proved that Aczel's constructive set theory $\mathbf{CZF}$ extended with inaccessible sets of all transfinite orders can be interpreted in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory $\mathbf{MLTT}$ extended with Setzer's Mahlo universe and another universe above it. In this paper we show that this interpretation can be carried out bottom-up without the universe above the Mahlo universe, provided we add an accessibility predicate instead. If we work in Martin-L\"{o}f type theory with extensional identity types the accessibility predicate can be defined in terms of $\mathrm{W}$-types. The main part of our interpretation has been formalised in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>CMSO-transducing tree-like graph decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04970v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give $\operatorname{CMSO}$-transductions that, given a graph $G$, output its modular decomposition, its split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by Courcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such transductions using order-invariant $\operatorname{MSO}$, a strictly more expressive logic than $\operatorname{CMSO}$. Our methods more generally yield $\operatorname{C}_2\!\operatorname{MSO}$-transductions that output the canonical decompositions of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of bipartitions.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Framework for On-the-Fly LTLf Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena) construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis. Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.</description>
