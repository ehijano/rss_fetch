      <title>Uni-FinLLM: A Unified Multimodal Large Language Model with Modular Task Heads for Micro-Level Stock Prediction and Macro-Level Systemic Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial institutions and regulators require systems that integrate heterogeneous data to assess risks from stock fluctuations to systemic vulnerabilities. Existing approaches often treat these tasks in isolation, failing to capture cross-scale dependencies. We propose Uni-FinLLM, a unified multimodal large language model that uses a shared Transformer backbone and modular task heads to jointly process financial text, numerical time series, fundamentals, and visual data. Through cross-modal attention and multi-task optimization, it learns a coherent representation for micro-, meso-, and macro-level predictions. Evaluated on stock forecasting, credit-risk assessment, and systemic-risk detection, Uni-FinLLM significantly outperforms baselines. It raises stock directional accuracy to 67.4% (from 61.7%), credit-risk accuracy to 84.1% (from 79.6%), and macro early-warning accuracy to 82.3%. Results validate that a unified multimodal LLM can jointly model asset behavior and systemic vulnerabilities, offering a scalable decision-support engine for finance.</description>

      <title>Network topology of the Euro Area interbank market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial data, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the need of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful information from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network approach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct layers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial relationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data collections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze and compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives, eventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This granular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and practitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to support financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more holistic point of view.</description>
