      <title>On the Codebook Design for NOMA Schemes from Bent Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for massive connectivity with low latency and high energy efficiency. In code-domain NOMA schemes, the requirements boil down to the design of codebooks that contain a large number of spreading sequences with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) while maintaining low coherence. When employing binary Golay sequences with guaranteed low PAPR in the design, the fundamental problem is to construct a large set of $n$-variable quadratic bent or near-bent functions in a particular form such that the difference of any two is bent for even $n$ or near-bent for odd $n$ to achieve optimally low coherence. In this work, we propose a theoretical construction of NOMA codebooks by applying a recursive approach to those particular quadratic bent functions in smaller dimensions. The proposed construction yields desired NOMA codebooks that contain $6\cdot N$ Golay sequences of length $N=2^{4m}$ for any positive integer $m$ and have the lowest possible coherence $1/\sqrt{N}$.</description>

      <title>Paired Disjunctive Domination Number of Middle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of domination in graphs plays a central role in understanding structural properties and applications in network theory. In this study, we focus on the paired disjunctive domination number in the context of middle graphs, a transformation that captures both adjacency and incidence relations of the original graph. We begin by investigating this parameter for middle graphs of several special graph classes, including path graphs, cycle graphs, wheel graphs, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, star graphs, friendship graphs, and double star graphs. We then present general results by establishing lower and upper bounds for the paired disjunctive domination number in middle graphs of arbitrary graphs, with particular emphasis on trees. Additionally, we determine the exact value of the parameter for middle graphs obtained through the join operation. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of domination-type parameters in transformed graph structures and offer new insights into their combinatorial behavior.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Grundy Domination and Zero Forcing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence, every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other versions of this problem: $\mathsf{Grundy~Total~Domination}$, $\mathsf{L\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$, and $\mathsf{Z\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$. We show that all four problem variants are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-complete when parameterized by the solution size.
  On the other hand, we consider the family of zero forcing problems which form the parametric duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that the dual of $\mathsf{Z\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$, known as $\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems. Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that are not in the dominating sequence. In contrast, we show that $\mathsf{L\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$ is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for that parameter.</description>

      <title>A 13/6-Approximation for Strip Packing via the Bottom-Left Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Strip Packing problem, we are given a vertical strip of fixed width and unbounded height, along with a set of axis-parallel rectangles. The task is to place all rectangles within the strip, without overlaps, while minimizing the height of the packing. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The Bottom-Left Algorithm is a simple and widely used heuristic for Strip Packing. Given a fixed order of the rectangles, it places them one by one, always choosing the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, the leftmost one. Baker, Coffman, and Rivest proved in 1980 that the Bottom-Left Algorithm has approximation ratio 3 if the rectangles are sorted by decreasing width. For the past 45 years, no alternative ordering has been found that improves this bound. We introduce a new rectangle ordering and show that with this ordering the Bottom-Left Algorithm achieves a 13/6 approximation for the Strip Packing problem.</description>
