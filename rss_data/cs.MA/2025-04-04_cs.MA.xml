      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey investigates foundational technologies essential for developing effective Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems. Aiming to answer how best to optimize these systems for collaborative, dynamic environments, we focus on four critical areas: Architecture, Memory, Planning, and Technologies/Frameworks. By analyzing recent advancements and their limitations - such as scalability, real-time response challenges, and agent coordination constraints, we provide a detailed view of the technological landscape. Frameworks like the Mixture of Agents architecture and the ReAct planning model exemplify current innovations, showcasing improvements in role assignment and decision-making. This review synthesizes key strengths and persistent challenges, offering practical recommendations to enhance system scalability, agent collaboration, and adaptability. Our findings provide a roadmap for future research, supporting the creation of robust, efficient multi-agent systems that advance both individual agent performance and collective system resilience.</description>

      <title>Self-Resource Allocation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of LLMs as agents, there is a growing interest in connecting multiple agents into multi-agent systems to solve tasks concurrently, focusing on their role in task assignment and coordination. This paper explores how LLMs can effectively allocate computational tasks among multiple agents, considering factors such as cost, efficiency, and performance. In this work, we address key questions, including the effectiveness of LLMs as orchestrators and planners, comparing their effectiveness in task assignment and coordination. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high validity and accuracy in resource allocation tasks. We find that the planner method outperforms the orchestrator method in handling concurrent actions, resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of agents. Additionally, we show that providing explicit information about worker capabilities enhances the allocation strategies of planners, particularly when dealing with suboptimal workers.</description>

      <title>Achieving Unanimous Consensus in Decision Making Using Multi-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain consensus mechanisms have relied on algorithms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to ensure network functionality and integrity. However, these approaches struggle with adaptability for decision-making where the opinions of each matter rather than reaching an agreement based on honest majority or weighted consensus. This paper introduces a novel deliberation-based consensus mechanism where Large Language Models (LLMs) act as rational agents engaging in structured discussions to reach a unanimous consensus. By leveraging graded consensus and a multi-round deliberation process, our approach ensures both unanimous consensus for definitive problems and graded confidence for prioritized decisions and policies. We provide a formalization of our system and use it to show that the properties of blockchains: consistency, agreement, liveness, and determinism are maintained. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate our system's feasibility, showcasing how our deliberation method's convergence, block properties, and accuracy enable decision-making on blockchain networks. We also address key challenges with this novel approach such as degeneration of thoughts, hallucinations, malicious models and nodes, resource consumption, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Techniques for coordination of multi-agent systems are vast and varied, often utilizing purpose-built solvers or controllers with tight coupling to the types of systems involved or the coordination goal. In this paper, we introduce a general unified framework for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination using the language of cellular sheaves and nonlinear sheaf Laplacians, which are generalizations of graphs and graph Laplacians. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a nonlinear homological program encompassing a choice of cellular sheaf on an undirected graph, nonlinear edge potential functions, and constrained convex node objectives. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers to derive a distributed optimization algorithm for solving these nonlinear homological programs. To demonstrate the wide applicability of this framework, we show how hybrid coordination goals including combinations of consensus, formation, and flocking can be formulated as nonlinear homological programs and provide numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our distributed solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>Am I Being Treated Fairly? A Conceptual Framework for Individuals to Ascertain Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current fairness metrics and mitigation techniques provide tools for practitioners to asses how non-discriminatory Automatic Decision Making (ADM) systems are. What if I, as an individual facing a decision taken by an ADM system, would like to know: Am I being treated fairly? We explore how to create the affordance for users to be able to ask this question of ADM. In this paper, we argue for the reification of fairness not only as a property of ADM, but also as an epistemic right of an individual to acquire information about the decisions that affect them and use that information to contest and seek effective redress against those decisions, in case they are proven to be discriminatory. We examine key concepts from existing research not only in algorithmic fairness but also in explainable artificial intelligence, accountability, and contestability. Integrating notions from these domains, we propose a conceptual framework to ascertain fairness by combining different tools that empower the end-users of ADM systems. Our framework shifts the focus from technical solutions aimed at practitioners to mechanisms that enable individuals to understand, challenge, and verify the fairness of decisions, and also serves as a blueprint for organizations and policymakers, bridging the gap between technical requirements and practical, user-centered accountability.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Policy-Gradient Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Shepherding Control of Non-Cohesive Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning solution for multi-agent shepherding of non-cohesive targets using policy-gradient methods. Our architecture integrates target-selection with target-driving through Proximal Policy Optimization, overcoming discrete-action constraints of previous Deep Q-Network approaches and enabling smoother agent trajectories. This model-free framework effectively solves the shepherding problem without prior dynamics knowledge. Experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and scalability with increased target numbers and limited sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Sequential Binary Hypothesis Testing with Competing Agents under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns sequential hypothesis testing in competitive multi-agent systems where agents exchange potentially manipulated information. Specifically, a two-agent scenario is studied where each agent aims to correctly infer the true state of nature while optimizing decision speed and accuracy. At each iteration, agents collect private observations, update their beliefs, and share (possibly corrupted) belief signals with their counterparts before deciding whether to stop and declare a state, or continue gathering more information. The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share information strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves equal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs; (2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for belief updating while using received information only to anticipate their counterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence threshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional probability of error. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that agents with higher KL divergence in their conditional distributions gain competitive advantage. Furthermore, our results establish that information sharing -- despite strategic manipulation -- reduces overall system stopping time compared to non-interactive scenarios, which highlights the inherent value of communication even in this competitive setup.</description>

      <title>Safety-Aware Multi-Agent Learning for Dynamic Network Bridging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing complex cooperative tasks in safety-critical environments poses significant challenges for multi-agent systems, especially under conditions of partial observability. We focus on a dynamic network bridging task, where agents must learn to maintain a communication path between two moving targets. To ensure safety during training and deployment, we integrate a control-theoretic safety filter that enforces collision avoidance through local setpoint updates. We develop and evaluate multi-agent reinforcement learning safety-informed message passing, showing that encoding safety filter activations as edge-level features improves coordination. The results suggest that local safety enforcement and decentralized learning can be effectively combined in distributed multi-agent tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatio-temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent urban traffic management solutions. We release the code to support the reproducibility of this work at https://github.com/Edun-Eyes/TSC</description>

      <title>Agent-based modeling for realistic reproduction of human mobility and contact behavior to evaluate test and isolation strategies in epidemic infectious disease spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models have proven to be useful tools in supporting decision-making processes in different application domains. The advent of modern computers and supercomputers has enabled these bottom-up approaches to realistically model human mobility and contact behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic showcased the urgent need for detailed and informative models that can answer research questions on transmission dynamics. We present a sophisticated agent-based model to simulate the spread of respiratory diseases. The model is highly modularized and can be used on various scales, from a small collection of buildings up to cities or countries. Although not being the focus of this paper, the model has undergone performance engineering on a single core and provides an efficient intra- and inter-simulation parallelization for time-critical decision-making processes.
  In order to allow answering research questions on individual level resolution, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies such as face masks or venue closures can be implemented for particular locations or agents. In particular, we allow for sophisticated testing and isolation strategies to study the effects of minimal-invasive infectious disease mitigation. With realistic human mobility patterns for the region of Brunswick, Germany, we study the effects of different interventions between March 1st and May 30, 2021 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our analyses suggest that symptom-independent testing has limited impact on the mitigation of disease dynamics if the dark figure in symptomatic cases is high. Furthermore, we found that quarantine length is more important than quarantine efficiency but that, with sufficient symptomatic control, also short quarantines can have a substantial effect.</description>

      <title>The Overcooked Generalisation Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge (OGC) - the first benchmark to study agents' zero-shot cooperation abilities when faced with novel partners and levels in the Overcooked-AI environment. This perspective starkly contrasts a large body of previous work that has trained and evaluated cooperating agents only on the same level, failing to capture generalisation abilities required for real-world human-AI cooperation. Our challenge interfaces with state-of-the-art dual curriculum design (DCD) methods to generate auto-curricula for training general agents in Overcooked. It is the first cooperative multi-agent environment specially designed for DCD methods and, consequently, the first benchmarked with state-of-the-art methods. It is fully GPU-accelerated, built on the DCD benchmark suite minimax, and freely available under an open-source license: https://git.hcics.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/public-projects/OGC. We show that current DCD algorithms struggle to produce useful policies in this novel challenge, even if combined with recent network architectures that were designed for scalability and generalisability. The OGC pushes the boundaries of real-world human-AI cooperation by enabling the research community to study the impact of generalisation on cooperating agents.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of voting rules based on majority margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting rules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting rule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head margins of victory or loss between candidates, then the voting rule yields the same outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural invariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative axiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question for voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a ranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is margin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative content. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two voters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either voter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on the election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's preference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel programming model, Data Spatial Programming, which extends the semantics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by introducing new class-like constructs called archetypes. These archetypes encapsulate the topological relationships between data entities and the execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures or finite states. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in this topological space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where a topology of connections is formed for the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing a wide range of problems in computer science such as agent-based systems, social networks, processing on relational data, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Causal Mechanism of Political Opinion Dynamics: A Model of Hierarchical Coarse-Graining with Community-Bounded Social Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing polarization in democratic societies is an emergent outcome of political opinion dynamics. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of political opinions, from individual beliefs to collective consensus, remain unknown. Understanding that a causal mechanism must account for both bottom-up and top-down influences, we conceptualize political opinion dynamics as hierarchical coarse-graining, where microscale opinions integrate into a macro-scale state variable. Using the CODA (Continuous Opinions Discrete Actions) model, we simulate Bayesian opinion updating, social identity-based information integration, and migration between social identity groups to represent higher-level connectivity. This results in coarse-graining across micro, meso, and macro levels. Our findings show that higher-level connectivity shapes information integration, yielding three regimes: independent (disconnected, local convergence), parallel (fast, global convergence), and iterative (slow, stepwise convergence). In the iterative regime, low connectivity fosters transient diversity, indicating an informed consensus. In all regimes, time-scale separation leads to downward causation, where agents converge on the aggregate majority choice, driving consensus. Critically, any degree of coherent higher-level information integration can overcome misalignment via global downward causation. The results highlight how emergent properties of the causal mechanism, such as downward causation, are essential for consensus and may inform more precise investigations into polarized political discourse.</description>
