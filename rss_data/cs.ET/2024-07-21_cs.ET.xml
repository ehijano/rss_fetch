      <title>SecureVAX: A Blockchain-Enabled Secure Vaccine Passport System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A vaccine passport serves as documentary proof, providing passport holders with greater freedom while roaming around during pandemics. It confirms vaccination against certain infectious diseases like COVID-19, Ebola, and flu. The key challenges faced by the digital vaccine passport system include passport forgery, unauthorized data access, and inaccurate information input by vaccination centers. Privacy concerns also need to be addressed to ensure that the user's personal identification information (PII) is not compromised. Additionally, it is necessary to track vaccine vials or doses to verify their authenticity, prevent misuse and illegal sales, as well as to restrict the illicit distribution of vaccines. To address these challenges, we propose a Blockchain-Enabled Secure Vaccine Passport System, leveraging the power of smart contracts. Our solution integrates off-chain and on-chain cryptographic computations, facilitating secure communication among various entities. We have utilized the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store encrypted vaccine passports of citizens securely. Our prototype is built on the Ethereum platform, with smart contracts deployed on the Sepolia Test network, allowing for performance evaluation and validation of the system's effectiveness. By combining IPFS as a distributed data storage platform and Ethereum as a blockchain platform, our solution paves the way for secure, efficient, and globally interoperable vaccine passport management, supporting comprehensive vaccination initiatives worldwide.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Qrisp QAOA: description and preliminary comparison with Qiskit counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the presentation and evaluation of the high-level quantum programming language Eclipse Qrisp. The presented framework, used for developing and compiling quantum algorithms, is measured in terms of efficiency for its implementation of the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Module. We measure this efficiency and compare it against two alternative QAOA algorithm implementations using IBM's Qiskit toolkit. The evaluation process has been carried out over a benchmark composed of 15 instances of the well-known Maximum Cut Problem. Through this preliminary experimentation, Eclipse Qrisp demonstrated promising results, outperforming both versions of its counterparts in terms of results quality and circuit complexity.</description>
