      <title>Partial confinement in a quantum-link simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement/deconfinement, captivating attributes of high-energy elementary particles, have recently garnered wide attention in quantum simulations based on cold atoms. Yet, the partial confinement, an intermediate state between the confinement and deconfinement, remains underexplored. The partial confinement encapsulates the phenomenon that the confining behavior of charged particles is contingent upon their relative positions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the spin-1 quantum link model provides an excellent platform for exploring partial confinement. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the physics emerging from partial confinement in both the context of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. Potential experimental setups using cold atoms are also discussed. Our work offers a simple and feasible routine for the study of confinement-related physics in the state-of-the-art artificial quantum systems subject to gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Autonomous dynamics of two-dimensional insulating domain with superclimbing edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superclimbing dynamics is the signature feature of transverse quantum fluids describing wide superfluid one-dimensional interfaces and/or edges with negligible Peierls barrier. Using Lagrangian formalism, we show how the essence of the superclimb phenomenon -- dynamic conjugation of the fields of the superfluid phase and geometric shape -- clearly manifests itself via characteristic modes of autonomous motion of the insulating domain (``droplet") with superclimbing edges. In the translation invariant case and in the absence of supercurrent along the edge, the droplet demonstrates ballistic motion with the velocity-dependent shape and zero bulk currents. In an isotropic trapping potential, the droplet features a doubly degenerate sloshing mode. The period of the ground-state evolution of the superfluid phase (dictating the frequency of the AC Josephson effect) is sensitive to the geometry of the droplet. The supercurrent along the edge dramatically changes the droplet dynamics: The motion acquires features resembling that of a 2D charged particle interacting with a perpendicular magnetic field. In a linear external potential (uniform force field), the state with a supercurrent demonstrates a spectacular gyroscopic effect -- uniform motion in the perpendicular to the force direction.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>An unconventional deformation of the nonrelativistic spin-1/2 Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a generalization of nonrelativistic fermionic statistics that interpolates between bosons and fermions, in which up to $K$ particles may occupy a single-particle state. We show that it can be mapped exactly to $K$ flavors of fermions with imaginary polarization. In particular, for $K\!=\!2$, we use such a mapping to derive the virial coefficients and relate them to those of conventional spin-1/2 fermions in an exact fashion. We also use the mapping to derive next-to-leading-order perturbative results for the pressure equation of state. Our results indicate that the $K\!=\!2$ particles are more strongly coupled than conventional spin-$1/2$ fermions, as measured by the interaction effects on the virial expansion and on the pressure equation of state. In the regime set by the unitary limit, the proposed $K\!=\!2$ deformation represents a universal many-body system whose properties remain largely unknown. In particular, the system can be expected to become superfluid at a critical temperature $T_c$ higher than that of the unitary limit. We suggest it may be possible to realize this system experimentally by engineering a polarized coupling to an electrostatic potential. Finally, we show that the $K\!=\!2$ system does not display a sign problem for determinantal Monte Carlo calculations, which indicates that $T_c$ can at least in principle be calculated with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Extreme fragmentation of a Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragmentation of an interacting Bose gas refers to the macroscopic occupation of a finite set of single-particle eigenstates. This phenomenon is related to the notion of particle-number squeezing in quantum optics, an exquisite property of quantum states that can offer metrological gain. So far, fragmentation has only been partially achieved in experiments involving a large number $N$ of bosons in few modes. Here, we introduce a practical and efficient scheme to prepare fragmented states in systems realizing the $L$-mode Bose-Hubbard model. We demonstrate how a large energy detuning between the modes can be used as a practical control parameter to successfully fragment a Bose gas over an extremely short preparation time. Applying an optimal-control approach within realistic experimental constraints, we obtain total fragmentation at a high filling factor, realizing $\ket{N/L,...,N/L}$ Fock states with hundreds of bosons in very few modes over a few tunneling times.</description>

      <title>Interaction driven topological phase transitions of hardcore bosons on a two-leg ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of hardcore bosons possessing nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions on a two-leg ladder. We show that by allowing dimerized interactions instead of hopping dimerization, the system exhibits topological phases and phase transitions under proper conditions. First, by assuming uniform hopping throughout the ladder, we show that when interaction along the legs are dimerized and the dimerization pattern is different in the legs, a trivial rung-Mott insulator to a topological bond order phase transition occurs as a function of the dimerization strength. However, for a fixed dimerization strength, the system exhibits a topological to trivial phase transition with increase in the rung hopping. A completely different scenario appears when the rung interaction is turned on. We obtain that for a ladder with uniform hopping, the repulsive interaction either turns the topological phase into a trivial rung-Mott insulator or a charge density wave phase. Such feature is absent when the dimerization pattern in the nearest neighbour interaction is considered to be identical in both the legs of the ladder. We numerically obtain the ground state properties and show the signatures of topological phase transition through Thouless charge pumping.</description>

      <title>Two-axis twisting using Floquet-engineered XYZ spin models with polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar molecules confined in an optical lattice are a versatile platform to explore spin-motion dynamics based on strong, long-range dipolar interactions. The precise tunability of Ising and spin-exchange interactions with both microwave and dc electric fields makes the molecular system particularly suitable for engineering complex many-body dynamics. Here, we used Floquet engineering to realize interesting quantum many-body systems of polar molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of ultracold KRb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a dc electric field through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics, setting the stage for the realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we observed two-axis twisting mean-field dynamics, generated by a Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in 2D layers. In the future, Floquet-engineered Hamiltonians could generate entangled states for molecule-based precision measurement or could take advantage of the rich molecular structure for quantum simulation of multi-level systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Generalized t-J Spin Dynamics with Tunable Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. Here, we report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We systematically explore the role of dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the effect of motion on spin dynamics. The model parameters can be controlled independently, with dipolar couplings tuned by electric fields and motion regulated by optical lattices. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. These observations are supported by theory models established in different motional regimes that provide intuitive pictures of the underlying physics. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods, and it could shed light on the complex behaviors observed in real materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Origin of Floquet Thermalization in Periodically Driven Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is a powerful manipulation method in modern quantum technology. However, unwanted heating is the main challenge of Floquet engineering, therefore the Floquet thermalization has attracting considerable attentions recently. In this work, we investigate thermalization of periodically driven many-body systems through the lens of Krylov complexity, and find a topological origin of different thermalization behaviors. We demonstrate that If the topology of the Krylov chain is nontrivial, a periodically driven system will reach a state with finite temperature. When the Krylov chain is topologically trivial, the system will be heated to infinite temperature. We further show that the prethermalization can be understood as the tunnelling process of a quasi-edge mode through the local gap on Krylov chain. This picture provides a systematically method to obtain the effective prethermal Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: Here, we explore the quantum propagation of exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities, exhibiting intriguing effects such as interactions, decay, and disorder scatterings. Our investigation uncovers anomalies in their quantum propagation, deviating from predictions based on existing theories. By applying scaling theory, we elucidate the true nature of exciton polariton propagation, unveiling a localization phase that characteristically differs from Anderson localization. Our numerical results agree with the self-consistent theory developed for exciton polariton condensates, incorporating non-linearity and finite lifetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures of the mixed classical phase space for three interacting particles in a circular trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically two consequences of the mixed classical phase space for three repulsively-interacting bosonic particles in a circular trap. First, we show that the energy levels of the corresponding quantum system are well described by a Berry-Robnik distribution. Second, we identify stationary quantum states whose density is enhanced along the stable classical periodic trajectories, and calculate their energies and wavefunctions using the semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) theory. Our EBK results are in excellent agreement with our full-fledged finite-element numerics. We discuss the impact of discrete symmetries, including bosonic exchange symmetry, on these classically localized states. They are within experimental reach, and occur in the same range of energies as the quantum scar reported in our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 107, 022217 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Narrow linewidth exciton-polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single-mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra-narrow linewidth of 56~MHz or 0.24~$\mu$eV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7~ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. Our results open up opportunities for manipulating the macroscopic quantum state of the system owing to its long coherence time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Floquet amorphous topological orders in experimentally accessible one-dimensional array of randomly pointed Rydberg atoms with periodic driving. The filling factor in the chain is tunable by applying a microwave field. We give a complete characterization of the topological properties from both the single-particle and many-body aspect. The periodic driving results in richer topological phases. At the single-particle level, we calculate the real space winding numbers and polarization, confirming robust amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a structural disorder induced topological phase transition acompanied with localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Furthermore, in the many-body case we find the existence of amorphous topological orders of the hardcore bosons half-filled the chain, in contrast described by the topological entanglement entropy and the string order. Possible detection methods are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Photon Condensation into Wannier-Stark States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly coupled light-matter systems can exhibit nonequilibrium collective phenomena due to loss and gain processes on the one hand and effective photon-photon interactions on the other hand. Here we study a photonic lattice system composed of a linear array of driven-dissipative coupled cavities (or cavity modes) with linearly increasing resonance frequencies across the lattice. The model amounts to a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model in a tilted potential without the particle-conservation constraint. We predict a diverse range of stationary and non-stationary states resulted from the interplay of the tilt, tunneling, on-site interactions, and the loss and gain processes. Our key finding is that, under weak on-site interactions, photons mostly Bose condense into a selected, single-particle Wannier-Stark state, instead of exhibiting expected Bloch oscillations. As the strength of the photon-photon interactions increase, a non-stationary regime emerges which is marked surprisingly by periodic Bloch-type oscillations. These intriguing, nontrivial effects are a direct consequence of the driven-dissipative nature of the system.</description>

Abstract: We review the quantum statistical properties of two-dimensional shell-shaped gases, produced by cooling and confining atomic ensembles in thin hollow shells. We consider both spherical and ellipsoidal shapes, discussing at zero and at finite temperature the phenomena of Bose-Einstein condensation and of superfluidity, the physics of vortices, and the crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The novel aspects associated to the curved geometry are elucidated in comparison with flat two-dimensional superfluids. We also describe the hydrodynamic excitations and their relation with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition for two-dimensional flat and curved superfluids. In the next years, shell-shaped atomic gases will be the leading experimental platform for investigations of quantum many-body physics in curved spatial domains.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering area for particles with infinite or zero scattering length in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansions of the wave function of three particles having equal mass with finite-range interactions and infinite or zero two-dimensional scattering length colliding at zero energy and zero orbital angular momentum, from which a three-body parameter $D$ is defined. The dimension of $D$ is length squared, and we call $D$ three-body scattering area. We find that the ground state energy per particle of a zero-temperature dilute Bose gas with these interactions is approximately $\frac{\hbar^2 D }{6m}\rho^2$, where $\rho$ is the number density of the bosons, $m$ is the mass of each boson, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant over $2\pi$. Such a Bose gas is stable at $D\geq 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, and metastable at $D&lt;0$ in the harmonic trap if the number of bosons is less than $N_{cr}\approx 3.6413 \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega |D|}}$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the harmonic trap. If the two-body interaction supports bound states, $D$ typically acquires a negative imaginary part, and we find the relation between this imaginary part and the amplitudes of the pair-boson production processes. We derive a formula for the three-body recombination rate constant of the many-boson system in terms of the imaginary part of $D$.</description>

Abstract: Emergent gauge theories take a prominent role in the description of quantum matter, supporting deconfined phases with topological order and fractionalized excitations. A common construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, first introduced by Wegner, involves Ising gauge spins placed on links and subject to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauss law constraint. As shown by Kitaev, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories also emerge in the exact solution of certain spin systems with bond-dependent interactions. In this context, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is constructed from Majorana fermions, with gauge constraints given by the parity of Majorana fermions on each site. In this work, we provide an explicit Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps between these two formulations on the square lattice, where the Kitaev-type gauge theory emerges as the exact solution of a spin-orbital (Kugel-Khomskii) Hamiltonian. We then apply our mapping to study local perturbations to the spin-orbital Hamiltonian, which correspond to anisotropic interactions between electric-field variables in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. These are shown to induce anisotropic confinement that is characterized by emergence of weakly-coupled one-dimensional spin chains. We study the nature of these phases and corresponding confinement transitions in both absence and presence of itinerant fermionic matter degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss how our mapping can be applied to the Kitaev spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms have been proposed to solve the maximum independent set problem: the PK algorithm, introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 101 (2020) 012318; Chin. Phys. Lett. 38, (2021) 030304], and the the HV algorithm, presented in [Science 376 (2022) 1209]. Here we demonstrate that the two algorithms are mathematically equivalent. Specifically, the Hamiltonian in the PK algorithm can be viewed as the HV Hamiltonian in the interaction picture. We remark on potential practical advantages of the PK algorithm.Although they are mathematically equivalent, their most straightforward physical implementations are different, and our numerical simulations suggest that the PK algorithm might can bring significant advantages.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum master equations beyond ultraweak coupling</title>

Abstract: Recently, Nathan and Rudner derived a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation from the Redfield equation. The claim is that the level of approximation is equal to that of the Redfield equation. Here we benchmark the Nathan-Rudner equation (NRE) against the exact solution of a damped harmonic oscillator and compare its performance to that of the time-dependent Redfield equation (RE). We find that which of the equations performs better depends on the regime considered. It turns out that the short-time dynamics is generally much better captured by the RE, whereas the NRE delivers results comparable to those of the rotating-wave approximation. For the steady state, in the high-temperature limit the RE again performs better and its solution approaches the exact result for ultrahigh temperatures. Nevertheless, here also the NR equation constitutes a good approximation. In the low-temperature limit, in turn, the NRE provides a better approximation than the RE. For too strong coupling, here the RE might even fail completely by predicting unphysical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi sea in a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which determines its conductance quantization and is characterized by Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Unlike gapped band topology described by the global feature of wave function, this topology of gapless system is associated with the geometry of Fermi sea, and thus probing and identifying $\chi_F$ are inherently difficult in higher-dimensional systems. Here, we propose a dimensional reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the feature of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. We also reveal a nontrivial correspondence between the Fermi sea topology and the gapped band topology by using an ingenious mapping, of which $\chi_F$ exactly equals to the topological invariant of gapped topological phases. This provides a potential way to capture $\chi_F$ through the topological superconductors. Our work opens an avenue to characterize and detect the Fermi sea topology using low-dimensional momentum information.</description>
