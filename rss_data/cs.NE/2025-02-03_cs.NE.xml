      <title>Scaling Policy Gradient Quality-Diversity with Massive Parallelization via Behavioral Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity optimization comprises a family of evolutionary algorithms aimed at generating a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions. MAP-Elites (ME), a notable example, is used effectively in fields like evolutionary robotics. However, the reliance of ME on random mutations from Genetic Algorithms limits its ability to evolve high-dimensional solutions. Methods proposed to overcome this include using gradient-based operators like policy gradients or natural evolution strategies. While successful at scaling ME for neuroevolution, these methods often suffer from slow training speeds, or difficulties in scaling with massive parallelization due to high computational demands or reliance on centralized actor-critic training. In this work, we introduce a fast, sample-efficient ME based algorithm capable of scaling up with massive parallelization, significantly reducing runtimes without compromising performance. Our method, ASCII-ME, unlike existing policy gradient quality-diversity methods, does not rely on centralized actor-critic training. It performs behavioral variations based on time step performance metrics and maps these variations to solutions using policy gradients. Our experiments show that ASCII-ME can generate a diverse collection of high-performing deep neural network policies in less than 250 seconds on a single GPU. Additionally, it operates on average, five times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms while still maintaining competitive sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Genetic AI: Evolutionary Simulation for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Genetic AI, a novel method for data analysis by evolutionary simulations. The method can be applied to data of any domain and allows for a data-less training of AI models. Without employing predefined rules or training data, Genetic AI first converts the input data into genes and organisms. In a simulation from first principles, these genes and organisms compete for fitness, where their behavior is governed by universal evolutionary strategies. Investigating evolutionary stable equilibriums, Genetic AI helps understanding correlations and symmetries in general input data. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the dynamics of exemplary systems.</description>

      <title>Structure Development in List-Sorting Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a one-layer attention-only transformer develops relevant structures while learning to sort lists of numbers. At the end of training, the model organizes its attention heads in two main modes that we refer to as vocabulary-splitting and copy-suppression. Both represent simpler modes than having multiple heads handle overlapping ranges of numbers. Interestingly, vocabulary-splitting is present regardless of whether we use weight decay, a common regularization technique thought to drive simplification, supporting the thesis that neural networks naturally prefer simpler solutions. We relate copy-suppression to a mechanism in GPT-2 and investigate its functional role in our model. Guided by insights from a developmental analysis of the model, we identify features in the training data that drive the model's final acquired solution. This provides a concrete example of how the training data shape the internal organization of transformers, paving the way for future studies that could help us better understand how LLMs develop their internal structures.</description>

      <title>Neuro-LIFT: A Neuromorphic, LLM-based Interactive Framework for Autonomous Drone FlighT at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.</description>

      <title>Loss shaping enhances exact gradient learning with Eventprop in spiking neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-based machine learning promises more energy-efficient AI on future neuromorphic hardware. Here, we investigate how the recently discovered Eventprop algorithm for gradient descent on exact gradients in spiking neural networks can be scaled up to challenging keyword recognition benchmarks. We implemented Eventprop in the GPU-enhanced Neural Networks framework and used it for training recurrent spiking neural networks on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets. We found that learning depended strongly on the loss function and extended Eventprop to a wider class of loss functions to enable effective training. We then tested a large number of data augmentations and regularisations as well as exploring different network structures; and heterogeneous and trainable timescales. We found that when combined with two specific augmentations, the right regularisation and a delay line input, Eventprop networks with one recurrent layer achieved state-of-the-art performance on Spiking Heidelberg Digits and good accuracy on Spiking Speech Commands. In comparison to a leading surrogate-gradient-based SNN training method, our GeNN Eventprop implementation is 3X faster and uses 4X less memory. This work is a significant step towards a low-power neuromorphic alternative to current machine learning paradigms.</description>

      <title>SAN: Hypothesizing Long-Term Synaptic Development and Neural Engram Mechanism in Scalable Model's Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) bridged the performance gap with Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) through sophisticated analysis of pre-trained parameter spaces. Starting from drawing insights from Neural Engrams (NE) in Biological Neural Networks (BNNs), we establish a connection between the low-rank property observed during PEFT's parameter space shifting and neurobiological mechanisms. This observation leads to our proposed method, Synapse and Neuron (SAN), which decomposes and propagates scaling components from anterior feature adjusting vectors towards posterior weight matrices. Our approach is theoretically grounded in Long-Term Potentiation/Depression (LTP/D) phenomena, which govern synapse development through neurotransmitter release modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: on \textbf{vision tasks} across VTAB, FGVC, and GIC (25 datasets) using ViT, SwinT and ConvNeXt, SAN outperforms FFT up to 8.7% and LoRA by 3.2%; on language tasks using Commonsense Reasoning (8 datasets) with LLaMA models (all generations), surpassing ChatGPT up to 8.5% and LoRA by 4.7%; on visual-language tasks using Mixed Visual Instruction (7 datasets) with LLaVA models, it exceeds FFT up to 2.4% and LoRA by 1.9%. Our code and W&amp;B log will be released in https://github.com/daviddaiiiii/SAN-PEFT</description>

      <title>BLEND: Behavior-guided Neural Population Dynamics Modeling via Privileged Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the nonlinear dynamics of neuronal populations represents a key pursuit in computational neuroscience. Recent research has increasingly focused on jointly modeling neural activity and behavior to unravel their interconnections. Despite significant efforts, these approaches often necessitate either intricate model designs or oversimplified assumptions. Given the frequent absence of perfectly paired neural-behavioral datasets in real-world scenarios when deploying these models, a critical yet understudied research question emerges: how to develop a model that performs well using only neural activity as input at inference, while benefiting from the insights gained from behavioral signals during training?
  To this end, we propose BLEND, the behavior-guided neural population dynamics modeling framework via privileged knowledge distillation. By considering behavior as privileged information, we train a teacher model that takes both behavior observations (privileged features) and neural activities (regular features) as inputs. A student model is then distilled using only neural activity. Unlike existing methods, our framework is model-agnostic and avoids making strong assumptions about the relationship between behavior and neural activity. This allows BLEND to enhance existing neural dynamics modeling architectures without developing specialized models from scratch. Extensive experiments across neural population activity modeling and transcriptomic neuron identity prediction tasks demonstrate strong capabilities of BLEND, reporting over 50% improvement in behavioral decoding and over 15% improvement in transcriptomic neuron identity prediction after behavior-guided distillation. Furthermore, we empirically explore various behavior-guided distillation strategies within the BLEND framework and present a comprehensive analysis of effectiveness and implications for model performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Event-based Delay Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting increased attention as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks. Spiking neurons are stateful and intrinsically recurrent, making them well-suited for spatio-temporal tasks. However, this intrinsic memory is limited by synaptic and membrane time constants. A powerful additional mechanism are delays. In this paper, we propose a novel event-based training method for SNNs with delays, grounded in the EventProp formalism and enabling the calculation of exact gradients with respect to weights and delays. Our method supports multiple spikes per neuron and, to our best knowledge, is the first delay learning algorithm to be applied to recurrent SNNs. We evaluate our method on a simple sequence detection task, and the Yin-Yang, Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm can optimize delays from suboptimal initial conditions and enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without delays. Finally, we show that our approach uses less than half the memory of the current state-of-the-art delay-learning method and is up to 26x faster.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Automatic Fall Detection of Soldiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Military personnel and security agents often face significant physical risks during conflict and engagement situations, particularly in urban operations. Ensuring the rapid and accurate communication of incidents involving injuries is crucial for the timely execution of rescue operations. This article presents research conducted under the scope of the Brazilian Navy's ``Soldier of the Future'' project, focusing on the development of a Casualty Detection System to identify injuries that could incapacitate a soldier and lead to severe blood loss. The study specifically addresses the detection of soldier falls, which may indicate critical injuries such as hypovolemic hemorrhagic shock. To generate the publicly available dataset, we used smartwatches and smartphones as wearable devices to collect inertial data from soldiers during various activities, including simulated falls. The data were used to train 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN1D) with the objective of accurately classifying falls that could result from life-threatening injuries. We explored different sensor placements (on the wrists and near the center of mass) and various approaches to using inertial variables, including linear and angular accelerations. The neural network models were optimized using Bayesian techniques to enhance their performance. The best-performing model and its results, discussed in this article, contribute to the advancement of automated systems for monitoring soldier safety and improving response times in engagement scenarios.</description>
