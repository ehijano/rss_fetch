      <title>Discovering the dynamics of \emph{Sargassum} rafts' centers of mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB. Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities. The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring sparsely connected rafts.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Aggregation of Phase Elements on the Unit Circle under Parametric External Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear aggregation dynamics of phase elements distributed on the unit circle under parametrically modulated external fields. Our model, inspired by flaky particle rotation in fluids, employs the equation ${d\alpha/dt} = \lambda(t)\sin 2(\alpha - \phi(t))$ with $\lambda(t) = \cos(\omega_1 t)$ and $\phi(t) = \omega_2 t$, representing a switching rotating attractive device where the attractive strength oscillates while the attractive point rotates at independent frequencies. Through numerical simulations and analytical approaches, we discover Arnold tongue-like structures in parameter space $(\omega_1, \omega_2)$, where initially isotropic phase distributions aggregate into highly anisotropic states. Complete aggregation occurs within wedge-shaped stability regions radiating from bifurcation points, forming band structures with characteristic slope relationships. The dynamics exhibit rich nonlinear behavior including attractors, limit cycles, and quasi-periodic trajectories in reduced indicator space spanned by aggregation degree ($I$), field-alignment measure ($O$), and temporal variation ($P$). Our findings reveal fundamental principles governing collective phase dynamics under competing temporal modulations, with potential applications spanning from biological synchronization to socio-economic dynamics and controllable collective systems.</description>

      <title>Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Boundary-layer transition in the age of data: from a comprehensive dataset to fine-grained prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The laminar-to-turbulent transition remains a fundamental and enduring challenge in fluid mechanics. Its complexity arises from the intrinsic nonlinearity and extreme sensitivity to external disturbances. This transition is critical in a wide range of applications, including aerospace, marine engineering, geophysical flows, and energy systems. While the governing physics can be well described by the Navier-Stokes equations, practical prediction efforts often fall short due to the lack of comprehensive models for perturbation initialization and turbulence generation in numerical simulations. To address the uncertainty introduced by unforeseeable environmental perturbations, we propose a fine-grained predictive framework that accurately predicts the transition location. The framework generates an extensive dataset using nonlinear parabolized stability equations (NPSE). NPSE simulations are performed over a wide range of randomly prescribed initial conditions for the generic zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary-layer flow, resulting in a large dataset that captures the nonlinear evolution of instability waves across three canonical transition pathways (Type-K, -H, and -O). From a database of 3000 simulation cases, we extract diagnostic quantities (e.g., wall pressure signals and skin-friction coefficients) from each simulation to construct a feature set that links pre-transition flow characteristics to transition onset locations. Machine learning models are systematically evaluated, with ensemble methods-particularly XGBoost-demonstrating exceptional predictive accuracy (mean relative error of approximately 0.001). Compared to methods currently available (e.g., N-factor, transitional turbulence model), this approach accounts for the physical process and achieves transition prediction without relying on any empirical parameters.</description>

      <title>Equilibration of Non-interacting Photons and Quantum Signatures of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibration plays a fundamental role in our understanding of statistical mechanics and the long-time dynamics of many-body systems. In quantum systems, the route to equilibration is intimately related to level repulsion and quantum signatures of chaos that are encoded in their unitary evolution. Chaotic quantum systems exhibit the level statistics characteristic of ensembles of random matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that single-particle chaos leads to equilibration of many non-interacting photons. We show that the underlying mechanisms for equilibration are operator spreading and quantum interference. More specifically, we demonstrate that the unitary dynamics of a general Floquet system implemented using single-mode phase shifters and multiport beamsplitters leads to equilibration of photons. We propose a realistic photonic implementation of the multiparticle kicked rotor, which is a Floquet system that we use as a concrete example of our general approach.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer entropy in non-integrable quantum evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>
