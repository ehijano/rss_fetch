      <title>Evaluating the Prediction of Wind Power Ramping Events in the Belgian Offshore Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluations are presented for the prediction of wind power ramping events in the Belgian Offshore Zone. Two models from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium are verified: the operational ALARO-4km and its version with Wind Farm Parameterization (WFP). Power predictions are produced using power curves and machine learning (ML). As standard metrics such as MAE are insufficient for evaluating ramps, the proposed framework incorporates time and power buffers, enabling a flexible assessment that tolerates minor errors. Results indicate that WFP models enhance ramping prediction skill, while ML provides more balanced forecasts by reducing both misses and false alarms. A Ramp Alignment Score is also introduced to quantify temporal errors by forecast lead time, confirming that WFP models yield smaller average timing errors. Moreover, the framework reveals that severe precipitation is a strong indicator of large, predictable ramps, whereas lighter precipitation is associated with greater forecast errors.</description>

      <title>Eruption column modelling of explosive volcanism on Venus</title>

Abstract: Volcanism on Venus has never been directly observed, but several measurements indicate present-day activity. Volcanism could potentially play a role in climatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth. Observation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus spacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian characteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and composition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume propagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an idealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME volcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian conditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The present study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of altitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H tropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For the first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds have a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes. Contrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on temperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to propagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due to the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher altitudes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Underwater Noise from Offshore Wind Turbines via Individual Pitch Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch control strategy to mitigate the underwater acoustic footprint of offshore wind turbines, a measure that will soon become necessary to minimize impacts on marine life, which rely on sound for communication, navigation, and survival. First, we quantify the underwater acoustic signature of blade-generated aerodynamic noise from three reference turbines, the NREL 5 MW, DTU 10 MW, and IEA 22 MW, using coupling blade element momentum and coupled air-water acoustic propagation modeling. Second, we propose and implement an open-loop individual pitch control (IPC) strategy that modulates the pitch of the blade at the blade passing frequency to attenuate the overall sound pressure level (OSPL) and the amplitude modulation (AM) of the transmitted noise. Third, we benchmark IPC performance against conventional pitch schemes. The results indicate that up to 5 dB reductions in OSPL and a decrease in AM depth 20% can be achieved with a pitch variation of $\Delta\theta\approx 5^\circ$, with small losses (5-10%) in energy capture. These findings highlight a previously underappreciated noise pathway and demonstrate that targeted blade-pitch modulation can mitigate its impact.</description>

      <title>Impact of Forecast Stability on Navigational Contrail Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MMitigating contrail-induced warming by re-routing flights around contrail-forming regions requires accurate and stable forecasts of the state of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Forecast stability (i.e., consistency between forecast cycles with different lead times) is particularly important for "pre-tactical" contrail avoidance strategies that adjust routes based on forecasts with lead times as long as 24-48 hours. However, no study to date has systematically quantified the degree to which forecast stability limits the effectiveness of pre-tactical avoidance. This study addresses this gap by comparing contrail forecasts generated using ECMWF HRES weather forecasts with lead times up to 48 hours to contrail hindcasts generated based on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. An analysis of forecast errors show low pointwise consistency between persistent-contrail-forming regions in forecasts and reanalysis, with pointwise error rates similar to those found in previous comparisons of contrail-forming regions in reanalysis and reality. However, we also show that spatial errors in the locations of contrail-forming regions are relatively small, both when forecasts are compared to reanalysis and when reanalysis is compared to in-situ measurements. Finally, we show that designing a trajectory optimizer to take advantage of relatively small spatial errors allows flight trajectory optimizations based on contrail forecasts to reduce contrail climate forcing evaluated based on reanalysis by 80-90% at the 8-24 hour lead times most relevant to flight planning, with fuel penalties under 0.4%. Our results show that forecasts with lead times relevant to flight planning are stable enough to be used for pre-tactical contrail avoidance.</description>
