      <title>HEART: automated build and test infrastructure for real-time controller development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Herzberg Extensible Adaptive optics Real-Time Toolkit (HEART) is a complete framework written in C and Python for building next-generation adaptive optics (AO) system real-time controllers, with the performance needed for extremely large telescopes. With numerous HEART-based RTCs now in their design or build phases, each with different AO algorithms, target hardware, and observatory requirements, continuous automated builds and tests are a cornerstone of our development effort. In this paper we describe the many levels of testing that we perform, from low-level unit tests of individual functions, to more complex component and system-level tests that verify both numerical correctness and execution performance. Incorporating extensive testing into HEART since its inception has allowed us to continuously (and confidently) refactor and extend it to both meet the changing needs of local on-sky experiments, as well as those of the several major facility instruments that we are developing.</description>

      <title>Fast resets of sub-windows on infrared detectors as a strategy for persistence mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistence effects in HgCdTe infrared detectors cause significant artifacts that can impact the quality of science observations for up to many hours after exposure to bright/saturating sources. This problem will have a substantially greater impact on viable observing modes for infrared cameras on future ELTs due to the leap in sensitivities that is expected. In this paper we present new results from an updated test system that was previously used to prototype ``on-detector guide windows'' to provide fast T/T feedback to AO systems, interleaved with simultaneous (slow) full-frame readouts for science. We now explore the possibility of continuously resetting these small regions of the detector that are illuminated with a compact source as a strategy for mitigating persistence, using two different detectors. While our results generally show promise for this observing strategy, we found for one of our detectors that the combination of fast localized resets with intense illumination can introduce a potentially problematic persistent change in local reset levels.</description>

      <title>Position reconstruction using deep learning for the HERD PSD beam test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD) facility is a dedicated high energy astronomy and particle physics experiment planned to be installed on the Chinese space station, aiming to detect high-energy cosmic rays (\si{\giga\electronvolt} $\sim$ \si{\peta\electronvolt}) and high-energy gamma rays (&gt; \SI{500}{\mega\electronvolt}). The Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD) is one of the sub-detectors of HERD, with its main function of providing real-time anti-conincidence signals for gamma-ray detection and the secondary function of measuring the charge of cosmic-rays. In 2023, a prototype of PSD was developed and tested at CERN PS\&amp;SPS. In this paper, we investigate the position response of the PSD using two reconstruction algorithms: the classic dual-readout ratio and the deep learning method (KAN \&amp; MLP neural network). With the latter, we achieved a position resolution of 2 mm ($1\sigma$), which is significantly better than the classic method.</description>

      <title>SPARC4 control system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPARC4 is a new astronomical instrument developed entirely by Brazilian institutions, currently installed on the 1.6-m Perkin-Elmer telescope of the Pico dos Dias Observatory. It allows the user to perform photometric or polarimetric observations simultaneously in the four SDSS bands (g, r, i, and z). In this paper, we describe the control system developed for SPARC4. This system is composed of S4ACS, S4ICS, and S4GUI softwares and associated hardware. S4ACS is responsible for controlling the four EMCCD scientific cameras (one for each instrument band). S4ICS controls the sensors and motors responsible for the moving parts of SPARC4. Finally, S4GUI is the interface used to perform observations, which includes the choice of instrument configuration and image acquisition parameters. S4GUI communicates with the instrument subsystems and with some observatory facilities, needed during the observations. Bench tests were performed for the determination of the overheads added by SPARC4 control system in the acquisition of photometric and polarimetric series of images. In the photometric mode, SPARC4 allows the acquisition of a series of 1400 full-frame images, with a deadtime of 4.5 ms between images. Besides, several image series can be concatenated with a deadtime of 450 ms plus the readout time of the last image. For the polarimetric mode, measurements can be obtained with a deadtime of 1.41 s plus the image readout time between subsequent waveplate positions. For both photometric and polarimetric modes, the user can choose among operating modes with image readout times between 5.9 ms and 1.24 s, which ultimately defines the instrument temporal performance.</description>

      <title>2D numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves using finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescence Gravitational Wave Signals Counting and Separation Using UnMixFormer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories approach unprecedented sensitivities, the need for robust methods to analyze increasingly complex, overlapping signals becomes ever more pressing. Existing matched-filtering approaches and deep-learning techniques can typically handle only one or two concurrent signals, offering limited adaptability to more varied and intricate superimposed waveforms. To overcome these constraints, we present the UnMixFormer, an attention-based architecture that not only identifies the unknown number of concurrent compact binary coalescence GW events but also disentangles their individual waveforms through a multi-decoder architecture, even when confronted with five overlapping signals. Our UnMixFormer is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies by modeling them in a dual-path manner, while also enhancing periodic feature representation by incorporating Fourier Analysis Networks. Our approach adeptly processes binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems over extended time series data (16,384 samples). When evaluating on synthetic data with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50, our method achieves 99.89% counting accuracy, a mean overlap of 0.9831 between separated waveforms and templates, and robust generalization ability to waveforms with spin precession, orbital eccentricity, and higher modes, marking a substantial advance in the precision and versatility of GW data analysis.</description>

      <title>Spatial orientation and shape of the velocity ellipsoids of the Gaia DR3 giants and subgiants in the Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of determining the parameters characterizing the shape and orientation of residual velocity ellipsoids from the Gaia DR3 red giants and subgiants. We show the distribution of velocity dispersions in the Galactic plane obtained from three components of the spatial velocity, as well as the coordinate distribution of the intersection points of the velocity ellipsoid axes with the celestial sphere, in particular the deviations of the longitudes and latitudes of the vertices of stellar regions located within spheres with a radius of 1 kpc centered in the Galactic mid-plane. The area of the Galactic disk under study is in the range of Galactocentric coordinates 0 &lt; R &lt; 15 kpc and $120^\circ &lt; \theta &lt; 240^\circ$. We show that the vertex deviations in some regions of the Galactic mid-plane can reach $30^\circ$ in longitude, and $15^\circ$ in latitude. This indicates the presence of kinematic distortions of the stellar velocity field, especially noticeable in the angular range of $150^\circ &lt; \theta &lt; 210^\circ$ at a distance of approximately 13 kpc. We propose the angles of deviation of longitudes and latitudes of the ellipsoid axes of residual stellar velocities to be considered as kinematic signatures of various Galactic deformations determined from real fields of spatial velocities. We present the distribution of parameters characterizing the shapes of velocity ellipsoids, as well as their distribution of the semi-axes length ratios. We note a local feature in this distribution and in the distribution of the elongation measurements of the ellipsoids. We perform a comparison of the results obtained from the tensor of deformation velocities and from the observed spatial velocities.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The overwhelming noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising a 30-day inspiral phase signal. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for a 30-day inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our absolute prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>
