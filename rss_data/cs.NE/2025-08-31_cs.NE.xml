      <title>Catwalk: Unary Top-K for Efficient Ramp-No-Leak Neuron Design for Temporal Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal neural networks (TNNs) are neuromorphic neural networks that utilize bit-serial temporal coding. TNNs are composed of columns, which in turn employ neurons as their building blocks. Each neuron processes volleys of input spikes, modulated by associated synaptic weights, on its dendritic inputs. Recently proposed neuron implementation in CMOS employs a Spike Response Model (SRM) with a ramp-no-leak (RNL) response function and assumes all the inputs can carry spikes. However, in actual spike volleys, only a small subset of the dendritic inputs actually carry spikes in each compute cycle. This form of sparsity can be exploited to achieve better hardware efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Catwalk neuron implementation by relocating spikes in a spike volley as a sorted subset cluster via unary top-k. Such relocation can significantly reduce the cost of the subsequent parallel counter (PC) for accumulating the response functions from the spiking inputs. This can lead to improvements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation. Place-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and power, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.</description>

      <title>NSPDI-SNN: An efficient lightweight SNN based on nonlinear synaptic pruning and dendritic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21566</link>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.</description>

      <title>Studying Evolutionary Solution Adaption Using a Flexibility Benchmark Based on a Metal Cutting Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optimizing for different production requirements from the viewpoint of a bio-inspired framework for system flexibility that allows us to study the ability of an algorithm to transfer solutions from previous optimization tasks, which also relates to dynamic evolutionary optimization.
  Optimizing manufacturing process parameters is typically a multi-objective problem with often contradictory objectives such as production quality and production time. If production requirements change, process parameters have to be optimized again. Since optimization usually requires costly simulations based on, for example, the Finite Element method, it is of great interest to have means to reduce the number of evaluations needed for optimization. Based on the extended Oxley model for orthogonal metal cutting, we introduce a multi-objective optimization benchmark where different materials define related optimization tasks.
  We use the benchmark to study the flexibility of NSGA-II, which we extend by two variants: 1) varying goals, which optimizes solutions for two tasks simultaneously to obtain in-between source solutions expected to be more adaptable, and 2) active-inactive genotype, which accommodates different possibilities that can be activated or deactivated. Results show that adaption, i.e. transferring a solution from a previous optimization task, with standard NSGA-II greatly reduces the number of evaluations required for optimization to a target goal in comparison to starting from scratch. The proposed variants further improve the adaption costs, although further work is needed towards making the methods advantageous for real applications.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Robustness of Spiking Neural Networks Trained by Local Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under adversarial examples that are nearly indistinguishable from clean data in the context of frame-based and event-based information. The majority of these studies are constrained in generating adversarial examples using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a gradient-based method which lacks biological plausibility. In contrast, local learning methods, which relax many of BPTT's constraints, remain under-explored in the context of adversarial attacks. To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs through the framework of four types of training algorithms. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ineffectiveness of gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarial instances in this scenario. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages the transferability of adversarial instances. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming existing adversarial attack methods. Furthermore, the generalizability of the method is assessed under multi-step adversarial attacks, adversarial attacks in black-box FGSM scenarios, and within the non-spiking domain.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Precision Printed Ternary Neural Networks with Holistic Evolutionary Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability, conformality, and ultra-low fabrication costs. Despite the large feature sizes in printed electronics, printed neural networks have attracted attention for meeting target application requirements, though realizing complex circuits remains challenging. This work bridges the gap between classification accuracy and area efficiency in printed neural networks, covering the entire processing-near-sensor system design and co-optimization from the analog-to-digital interface-a major area and power bottleneck-to the digital classifier. We propose an automated framework for designing printed Ternary Neural Networks with arbitrary input precision, utilizing multi-objective optimization and holistic approximation. Our circuits outperform existing approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average, being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5% accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.</description>
