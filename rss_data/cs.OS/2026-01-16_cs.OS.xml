      <title>Mitigating GIL Bottlenecks in Edge AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying Python based AI agents on resource-constrained edge devices presents a runtime optimization challenge: high thread counts are needed to mask I/O latency, yet Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) serializes execution. We demonstrate that naive thread-pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": &gt;= 20% throughput degradation at overprovisioned thread counts (N &gt;= 512) on edge-representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system using a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) that distinguishes genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (blocked by CPU-bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This provides practical optimization for edge AI systems.</description>

      <title>Sharpen the Spec, Cut the Code: A Case for Generative File System with SYSSPEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs. However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.
  This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS demonstrates equivalent level of correctness to that of a manually-coded baseline across hundreds of regression tests. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.</description>

      <title>DAVOS: An Autonomous Vehicle Operating System in the Vehicle Computing Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle computing represents a fundamental shift in how autonomous vehicles are designed and deployed, transforming them from isolated transportation systems into mobile computing platforms that support both safety-critical, real-time driving and data-centric services. In this setting, vehicles simultaneously support real-time driving pipelines and a growing set of data-driven applications, placing increased responsibility on the vehicle operating system to coordinate computation, data movement, storage, and access. These demands highlight recurring system considerations related to predictable execution, data and execution protection, efficient handling of high-rate sensor data, and long-term system evolvability, commonly summarized as Safety, Security, Efficiency, and Extensibility (SSEE). Existing vehicle operating systems and runtimes address these concerns in isolation, resulting in fragmented software stacks that limit coordination between autonomy workloads and vehicle data services. This paper presents DAVOS, the Delaware Autonomous Vehicle Operating System, a unified vehicle operating system architecture designed for the vehicle computing context. DAVOS provides a cohesive operating system foundation that supports both real-time autonomy and extensible vehicle computing within a single system framework.</description>
