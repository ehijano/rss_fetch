      <title>Walking on Archimedean Lattices: Insights from Bloch Band Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As a condensed matter physics application, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.</description>

      <title>Partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem from statistical mechanics and chaotic mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem (which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet (together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet can tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings, aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to undecidable behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.</description>

      <title>Expansion creates spin-glass order in finite-connectivity models: a rigorous and intuitive approach from the theory of LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large barriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical systems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry breaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for certain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a rigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models with local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs. To this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the mathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees extensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional assumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the low-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an asymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the landscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of the total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states -- which we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and treats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those with short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our results apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p, and while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family of codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random regular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both models undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to the onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.</description>

      <title>Interacting Hosts with Microbiome Exchange: An Extension of Metacommunity Theory for Discrete Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment, often substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they occupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength.</description>

      <title>Multi-loop spectra in general scalar EFTs and CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena, and we perform a detailed comparison between perturbative and non-perturbative predictions. Our results expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Generic Entanglement Structure in Doped Matchgate Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free fermionic Gaussian, a.k.a. matchgate, random circuits exhibit atypical behavior compared to generic interacting systems. They produce anomalously slow entanglement growth, characterized by diffusive scaling $S(t) \sim \sqrt{t}$, and evolve into volume-law entangled states at late times, $S \sim N$, which are highly unstable to measurements. Here, we investigate how doping such circuits with non-Gaussian resources (gates) restores entanglement structures of typical dynamics. We demonstrate that ballistic entanglement growth $S(t) \sim t$ is recovered after injecting an extensive total amount of non-Gaussian gates, also restoring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. When the evolution is perturbed with measurements, we uncover a measurement-induced phase transition between an area-law and a power-law entangled phase, $S \sim N^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ controlled by the doping. A genuine volume-law entangled phase is recovered only when non-Gaussian gates are injected at an extensive rate. Our findings bridge the dynamics of free and interacting fermionic systems, identifying non-Gaussianity as a key resource driving the emergence of non-integrable behavior.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Social Attractiveness on Casual Group Formation: Power-Law Group Sizes and Suppressed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.</description>

      <title>Coulomb-mediated single-electron heat transfer statistics across capacitively coupled silicon nanodots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer mediated by the Coulomb interaction reveals unconventional thermodynamic behavior and broadens thermodynamics research into fields such as quantum dynamics and information engineering. Although some experimental demonstrations of phenomena utilizing Coulomb-mediated heat transfer have been reported, estimations of their performance, such as efficiency, and their theoretical evaluations necessitate qualitative evaluation of the transfer mechanism itself, which remains challenging. We present an experiment investigating single-electron dynamics in two electrostatically coupled silicon nanodots to quantify Coulomb-mediated heat transfer at the nanoscale. By estimating the Coulomb interaction strength between the dots using the cross-correlation measurements of the single-electron dynamics, we convert the single-electron dynamics into the statistics of Coulomb-mediated heat transfer. Conducting the experiment at equilibrium enabled us to obtain a fluctuating net-zero heat transfer between the dots. These heat transfer statistics are essential for exploring device functionalities from the perspective of stochastic thermodynamics and for verifying universal relations in nonequilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometrical bound relations for observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bound relations among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bound relations for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, by generalizing the parameter space, we demonstrate that bound relations hold for all linear responses. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, by extending the projection operator, we establish a bound relation between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bound relations necessarily reflects quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Magic in the quantum Ising chain via Quantum Monte Carlo tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.</description>

Abstract: Recent work by Kousvos and Stergiou criticises our work with Zhong Ming Tan [arXiv:1505.00963]. The issue is CFT scaling dimension computations in perturbative Renormalization Group. We identified operators whose correlation functions differ by contact terms. This is allowed because CFT only describes correlation functions away from coincident points. They instead renormalize the contact terms, which are eventually dropped. Our way is not only correct, but preferable as it operates with the minimal set of quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-to-classical transition for finite-dimensional systems is widely considered to occur continuously, yet the mechanism underlying the intermediate stage remains unclear. In this work, we address this challenge by adopting an operational framework to bridge discrete generalized coherent state positive-operator-valued measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing channels. Our unified treatment reveals how dimensionality and decoherence rate collectively govern the quantum-to-classical transition. Notably, we demonstrate that a single-shot generalized measurement can eliminate most negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems. Furthermore, we propose quantum circuit implementations achievable with current state-of-the-art quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Discrete solitons in Rydberg atom chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons - localized wave packets that travel without spreading - play a central role in understanding transport and properties of nonlinear systems, from optical fibers to fluid dynamics. In quantum many-body systems, however, such robust excitations are typically destroyed by thermalization. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of solitonic excitations in high-energy states of Rydberg atom chains in the regime of strong nearest-neighbor Rydberg blockade. These localized wave packets propagate directionally atop a special class of reviving initial states related to quantum many-body scars and are capable of carrying energy. Exhibiting long coherence times, these states constitute a novel type of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and can be efficiently implemented on Rydberg atom simulators. In addition to a phenomenological description of solitons, we identify their counterpart in a classical nonlinear dynamical system obtained from a variational projection of the quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the potential use of solitons in quantum information transfer and conjecture their relevance for the anomalous energy transport reported in numerical studies of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>High-precision baryon number cumulants from lattice QCD in a finite box: cumulant ratios, Lee-Yang zeros and critical endpoint predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed high-statistics lattice simulations using 4HEX improved staggered fermions on $16^3 \times 8$ lattices. We calculated the Taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure with respect to the baryochemical potential to the tenth order at zero, and fourth order at purely imaginary chemical potentials. We used this data to construct rational function approximations of the free energy. We use a rational ansatz that explicitly satisfies the charge conjugation symmetry and the Roberge-Weiss periodicity, which are exact properties of the QCD free energy. We use this ansatz to estimate the position of Lee-Yang zeros in the complex chemical potential plane. The temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the Lee-Yang zeros is then fitted with ans\"atze motivated by the universal behavior of the free energy near a 3D Ising critical point. In principle, this allows one to estimate the temperature of the critical endpoint. We consider several sources of systematic errors. On this single lattice spacing we find that with $84\%$ probability, the chiral critical endpoint is either below $103$~MeV temperature or it does not exist. We also identify some caveats of the method, which do not disappear even with the extremely high statistics of this present study. We discuss to what extent these can be eliminated by future high statistics lattice analyses.</description>

      <title>Emergence of universality in transport of noisy free fermions</title>

Abstract: We analyze the effects of various forms of noise on one-dimensional systems of non-interacting fermions. In the strong noise limit, we demonstrate, under mild assumptions, that the statistics of the fermionic correlation matrix in the thermodynamic limit follow a universal form described by the recently introduced quantum simple symmetric exclusion process (Q-SSEP). For charge transport, we show that Q-SSEP, along with all models in its universality class, shares the same large deviation function for the transferred charge as the classical SSEP model. The method we introduce to derive this result relies on a gauge-like invariance associated with the choice of the bond where the current is measured. This approach enables the explicit calculation of the cumulant generating function for both Q-SSEP and SSEP and establishes an exact correspondence between them. These analytical findings are validated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results establish that a wide range of noisy free-fermionic models share the same Q-SSEP universality class and show that their transport properties are essentially classical.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>

      <title>Chaos in a Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners  at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. Specifically, using a simple depolarizing channel, we show that the relaxation of a dissipative transverse-field Ising chain can be significantly accelerated, underscoring the experimental feasibility of the protocol. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Absorbing state phase transitions beyond directed percolation in dissipative quantum state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that absorbing state phase transitions where the absorbing state itself exhibits long-range phase coherence can lead to critical behavior distinct from directed percolation. To do this, we investigate a simple, purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model, which may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W state with errors. The "error" Lindblad jump operators preserve the W state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates and show that local remnants of the coherence persist in the decohering phase. The distinct critical behavior stems from the spreading of coherence throughout the system at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Long-time analysis of a pair of on-lattice and continuous run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are characterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction reshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy conservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical models of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link between their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that as the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous RTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models converge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming configurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective attraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively explore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study is critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time. Because RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited to qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more accurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide deeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems, revealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport dynamics of elongated microparticles in microchannel flows. While smooth-walled channels preserve the dependence of particle trajectories on initial orientation and lateral position, we show that introducing periodically textured walls can trigger robust alignment of the particle along the channel centerline. This geometry-driven alignment arises from repeated reorientation torques generated by spatially modulated shear gradients near the textured walls. A resistive force theory-based analysis reveals that the effect stems from the anisotropic hydrodynamic response of the elongated particle to local shear, with maximal alignment torque occurring at intermediate particle orientations. The alignment efficiency depends on particle elongation and the relative texture wavelength, with an optimal range for maximal effect. While the observed alignment behavior is not limited to low Reynolds numbers, the characteristic alignment length scale diverges as the Reynolds number increases toward the turbulent flow regime. These findings offer a predictive framework for designing microfluidic devices that passively sort or focus anisotropic particles, with implications for soft matter transport, biophysical flows, and microfluidic engineering.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, the H theorem, and the second law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</description>

      <title>When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.</description>
