      <title>Contact/Symplectic Structure of Stochastic Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an exploration of the geometric characteristics of stochastic vector bundles. The paper begins by introducing the jet bundle emanating from the probability space of vector bundles. Subsequently, we derive the contact form of this jet bundle. The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Hamilton equation for the jet space, which reveals that the jet space of the probability space exhibits a contact structure. Notably, this structure reduces to a symplectic manifold in the context of autonomous systems. This reduction leads to a system equation that parallels the Hamilton equation, with the notable distinction that the Hamiltonian is substituted by the derivative of the probability. Our findings suggest the potential for a new geometric approach to addressing stochastic systems, offering a framework that may enhance our understanding and manipulation of these systems.</description>

      <title>Scattering off of Twistorial Line Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently devised chiral algebra bootstrap computes the form factors of a special class of ``twistorial'' 4d QFTs as correlation functions of the theory's 2d celestial chiral algebra. Examples of twistorial theories include self-dual Yang-Mills theory coupled to special massless matter content, and certain form factors in these theories are equivalent to a subset of MHV amplitudes in massless QCD, coupled to the same matter. In this paper, we extend the chiral algebra bootstrap to include scattering in the presence of charged sources, using a self-dual dyon in a twistorial theory as our main example. Self-dual theories in the presence of such sources lift to holomorphic gauge theories on non-Hausdorff twistor space, and we generalize the Koszul duality construction of Costello and Paquette to this setting. With this approach, we easily reproduce a recent formula of Adamo, Bogna, Mason, and Sharma for $n$-point MHV scattering of gluons off the self-dual dyon.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and complexity from string scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Krylov spread complexity in the context of black hole scattering by studying highly excited string states (HESS). Krylov complexity characterizes chaos by quantifying the spread of a state or operator under a known Hamiltonian. In contrast, quantum field theory often relies on S-matrices, where the Hamiltonian density becomes non-trivially time-dependent rendering the computations of complexity in Krylov basis exponentially hard. We define Krylov spread complexity for scattering amplitudes by analyzing the distribution of extrema, treating these as eigenvalues of a fictional Hamiltonian that evolves a thermo-field double state non-trivially. Our analysis of black hole scattering, through highly excited string states scattering into two or three tachyons, reveals that the Krylov complexity of these amplitudes mirrors the behavior of chaotic Hamiltonian evolution, with a pre-saturation peak indicating chaos. This formalism bridges the concepts of chaos in scattering and state evolution, offering a framework to distinguish different scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and fluctuations for hub dynamics in heterogeneous random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a class of heterogeneous random networks, where each node dynamics is a random dynamical system, interacting with neighbor nodes via a random coupling function, we characterize the hub behavior as the mean-field, subject to statistically controlled fluctuations. In particular, we prove that the fluctuations are small over exponentially long time scales and obtain Berry-Esseen estimates for the fluctuation statistics at any fixed time. Our results provide a mathematical explanation for several numerical observations, including the scaling relation between system size and frequency of large fluctuations, as well as system size induced desynchronization. To our best knowledge, these are the first characterizations of mean-field fluctuations on networks with a degree distribution that follows a power-law, a common feature for many realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Zeitlin's model for axisymmetric 3-D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeitlin's model is a spatial discretization for the 2-D Euler equations on the flat 2-torus or the 2-sphere. Contrary to other discretizations, it preserves the underlying geometric structure, namely that the Euler equations describe Riemannian geodesics on a Lie group. Here we show how to extend Zeitlin's approach to the axisymmetric Euler equations on the 3-sphere. It is the first discretization of the 3-D Euler equations that fully preserves the geometric structure. Thus, this finite-dimensional model admits Riemannian curvature and Jacobi equations, which are discussed.</description>

      <title>Perturbing scattering resonances in non-Hermitian systems: a generalized Wigner-Smith operator formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonances of open non-Hermitian systems are associated with the poles of the system scattering matrix. Perturbations of the system cause these poles to shift in the complex frequency plane. In this work, we introduce a novel method for calculating shifts in scattering matrix poles using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We link our method to traditional cavity perturbation theory and validate its effectiveness through application to complex photonic networks. Our findings underscore the versatility of generalized Wigner-Smith operators for analyzing a broad spectrum of resonant systems and provides new insight into resonant properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

      <title>Limit shapes and fluctuations for $(GL_n, GL_k)$ skew Howe duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the probability measures on Young diagrams in the $n \times k$ rectangle obtained by piecewise-continuously differentiable specializations of Schur polynomials in the dual Cauchy identity. We use a free fermionic representation of the correlation kernel to study its asymptotic behavior and derive the uniform convergence to a limit shape of Young diagrams in the limit $n,k \to \infty$. More specifically, we show the bulk is the discrete sine kernel with boundary fluctuations generically given by the Tracy-Widom distribution with the Airy kernel. When our limit shape touches the boundary corner of the rectangle, the fluctuations with a second order correction are given by the discrete Hermite kernel, and we recover the discrete distribution of Gravner-Tracy-Widom (2001) [arXiv:math/0005133] restricting to the leading order. Finally, we demonstrate our limit shapes can have sections with no or full density of particles, where the Pearcey kernel appears when such a section is infinitely small.</description>

Abstract: Brownian and fractional processes are useful computational tools for the modelling of physical phenomena. Here, modelling linear homopolymers in solution as Brownian or fractional processes, we develop a formalism to take into account both the interactions of the polymer with the solvent as well as the effect of arbitrary polymer-polymer potentials and Gibbs factors. As an example the average squared length is computed for a non-trivial Gaussian Gibbs factor, which is also compared with the Edwards' and a step factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we consider achieving the largest principle eigenvalue of a Robin Laplacian on a bounded domain $\Omega$ by optimizing the Robin parameter function under an integral constraint. The main novelty of our approach lies in establishing a close relation between the problem under consideration and the asymptotic behavior of the Dirichlet heat content of $\Omega$. By using this relation we deduce a two-term asymptotic expansion of the principle eigenvalue and discuss several applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale interactions in turbulent mixed convection drive efficient transport of Lagrangian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When turbulent convection interacts with a turbulent shear flow, the cores of convective cells become aligned with the mean current, and these cells (which span the height of the domain) may interact with motions closer to the solid boundary. In this work, we use coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow to demonstrate that under conditions of turbulent mixed convection, interactions between motions associated with ejections and low-speed streaks near the solid boundary, and coherent superstructures in the interior of the flow interact and lead to significant vertical transport of strongly settling Lagrangian particles. We show that the primary suspension mechanism is associated with strong ejection events (canonical low-speed streaks and hairpin vortices characterized by $u'&lt;0$ and $w'&gt;0$), whereas secondary suspension is strongly associated with large scale plume structures aligned with the mean shear (characterized by $w'&gt;0$ and $\theta'&gt;0$). This coupling, which is absent in the limiting cases (pure channel flow or free convection) is shown to lead to a sudden increase in the interior concentration profiles as $\mathrm{Ri}_\tau$ increases, resulting in concentrations that are larger by roughly an order of magnitude at the channel midplane.</description>

      <title>Identification of transformer overload and new energy planning for enterprises based on load forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:1201.2466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The new energy system constructed by energy storage and photovoltaic power generation system can effectively solve the problem of transformer overload operation in some enterprises. It can not only reduce the cost of electricity, but also realize low-carbon emission reduction. However, due to its low return on investment, the willingness of enterprises to install new energy is not high. In this paper, we first establish a load forecasting model to users whose transformers are overloaded or about to be overloaded, which are potential customers with new energy installation needs. Then, Optimal configuration models of PV and energy storage systems based on nonlinear programming are developed for these potential customers. The optimal installed capacity of the PV energy storage and the optimal charging and discharging strategy for the energy storage system can be obtained. This optimization strategy ensures that the electricity consumption of the enterprise does not exceed the rated capacity, and effectively reduces the enterprise's basic tariff and electricity price to achieve cost reduction and efficiency. Finally, taking a building materials production factory as an example, we obtain the optimal plan for the new energy capacity, as well as the economic benefits of the plan and the specific strategy of energy storage charging and discharging for this factory.</description>

Abstract: For any generalized Frobenius manifold with non-flat unity, we construct a bihamiltonian integrable hierarchy of hydrodynamic type which is an analogue of the Principal Hierarchy of a Frobenius manifold. We show that such an integrable hierarchy, which we also call the Principal Hierarchy, possesses Virasoro symmetries and a tau structure, and the Virasoro symmetries can be lifted to symmetries of the tau-cover of the integrable hierarchy. We derive the loop equation from the condition of linearization of actions of the Virasoro symmetries on the tau function, and construct the topological deformation of the Principal Hierarchy of a semisimple generalized Frobenius manifold with non-flat unity. We also give two examples of generalized Frobenius manifolds with non-flat unity and show that they are closely related to the well-known integrable hierarchies: the Volterra hierarchy, the q-deformed KdV hierarchy and the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fuzzy spaces (as special examples of noncommutative manifolds) with their quasicoherent states in order to find their pertinent metrics. We show that they are naturally endowed with two natural "quantum metrics" which are associated with quantum fluctuations of "paths". The first one provides the length the mean path whereas the second one provides the average length of the fluctuated paths. Onto the classical manifold associated with the quasicoherent state (manifold of the mean values of the coordinate observables in the state minimising their quantum uncertainties) these two metrics provides two minimising geodesic equations. Moreover, fuzzy spaces being not torsion free, we have also two different autoparallel geodesic equations associated with two different adiabatic regimes in the move of a probe onto the fuzzy space. We apply these mathematical results to quantum gravity in BFSS matrix models, and to the quantum information theory of a controlled qubit submitted to noises of a large quantum environment.</description>

Abstract: Quantum $L_\infty$ algebras are higher loop generalizations of cyclic $L_\infty$ algebras. Motivated by the problem of defining morphisms between such algebras, we construct a linear category of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic vector spaces and distributional half-densities, originally proposed by \v{S}evera. Morphisms in this category can be given both by formal half-densities and Lagrangian relations; we prove that the composition of such morphisms recovers the construction of homotopy transfer of quantum $L_\infty$ algebras. Finally, using this category, we propose a new notion of a relation between quantum $L_\infty$ algebras.</description>

Abstract: Given a function $f : A \to \mathbb{R}^n$ of a certain regularity defined on some open subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$, it is a classical problem of analysis to investigate whether the function can be extended to all of $\mathbb{R}^m$ in a certain regularity class. If an extension exists and is continuous, then certainly it is uniquely determined on the closure of $A$. A similar problem arises in general relativity for Lorentzian manifolds instead of functions on $\mathbb{R}^m$. It is well-known, however, that even if the extension of a Lorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ is analytic, various choices are in general possible at the boundary. This paper establishes a uniqueness condition for extensions of globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds $(M,g)$ with a focus on low regularities: any two extensions which are anchored by an inextendible causal curve $\gamma : [-1,0) \to M$ in the sense that $\gamma$ has limit points in both extensions, must agree locally around those limit points on the boundary as long as the extensions are at least locally Lipschitz continuous. We also show that this is sharp: anchored extensions which are only H\"older continuous do in general not enjoy this local uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Perfect Sampling for Hard Spheres from Strong Spatial Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a perfect sampling algorithm for the hard-sphere model on subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with expected running time linear in the volume under the assumption of strong spatial mixing. A large number of perfect and approximate sampling algorithms have been devised to sample from the hard-sphere model, and our perfect sampling algorithm is efficient for a range of parameters for which only efficient approximate samplers were previously known and is faster than these known approximate approaches. Our methods also extend to the more general setting of Gibbs point processes interacting via finite-range, repulsive potentials.</description>

      <title>Spectral Metric and Einstein Functionals for Hodge-Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the metric and Einstein bilinear functionals of differential forms introduced in Adv.Math.,Vol.427,(2023)1091286, for Hodge-Dirac operator $d+\delta$ on an oriented even-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We show that they reproduce these functionals for the canonical Dirac operator on a spin manifold up to a numerical factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the associated spectral triple is spectrally closed, which implies that it is torsion-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a trilinear functional of differential one-forms for a finitely summable regular spectral triple with a noncommutative residue. We demonstrate that for a canonical spectral triple over a closed spin manifold it recovers the torsion of the linear connection. We examine several spectral triples, including Hodge-de\,Rham, Einstein-Yang-Mills, almost-commutative two-sheeted space, conformally rescaled noncommutative tori, and quantum $SU(2)$ group, showing that the third one has a nonvanishing torsion if nontrivially coupled.</description>

      <title>Light propagation around a Kerr-like black hole immersed in an inhomogeneous anisotropic plasma in Rastall gravity: Analytical solutions to the equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the behavior of light ray trajectories in the exterior geometry of a rotating black hole within the Rastall theory of gravity, which is surrounded by an inhomogeneous anisotropic electronic cold plasma. By specifying the plasma's frequency profile, we derive fully analytical solutions for the temporal evolution of spacetime coordinates using elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions. These solutions illustrate various possible orbits. Throughout the study, we compare the results with those in the vacuum case, emphasizing the influence of plasma. Additionally, we utilize the analytical solutions to establish the lens equation for the considered spacetime. The investigation also addresses the significance of spherical photon orbits on critical trajectories, by presenting several examples.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Boundary touching probability and nested-path exponent for non-simple CLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformal loop ensemble (CLE) has two phases: for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4]$, the loops are simple and do not touch each other or the boundary; for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, the loops are non-simple and may touch each other and the boundary. For $\kappa\in(4,8)$, we derive the probability that the loop surrounding a given point touches the domain boundary. We also obtain the law of the conformal radius of this loop seen from the given point conditioned on the loop touching the boundary or not, refining a result of Schramm-Sheffield-Wilson (2009). As an application, we exactly evaluate the CLE counterpart of the nested-path exponent for the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) random cluster model recently introduced by Song-Tan-Zhang-Jacobsen-Nienhuis-Deng (2022). This exponent describes the asymptotic behavior of the number of nested open paths in the open cluster containing the origin when the cluster is large. For Bernoulli percolation, which corresponds to $\kappa=6$, the exponent was derived recently in Song-Jacobsen-Nienhuis-Sportiello-Deng (2023) by a color switching argument. For $\kappa\neq 6$, and in particular for the FK-Ising case, our formula appears to be new. Our derivation begins with Sheffield's construction of CLE from which the quantities of interest can be expressed by radial SLE. We solve the radial SLE problem using the coupling between SLE and Liouville quantum gravity, along with the exact solvability of Liouville conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Einstein manifolds with optical geometries of Kerr type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the Ricci flat Lorentzian $n$-manifolds satisfying three particular conditions, encoding and combining some crucial features of the Kerr metrics and the Robinson-Trautman optical structures. We prove that: (a) If $n&gt;4$, there is no Lorentzian manifold satisfying the considered Kerr type conditions, in unexpected contrast with what occurs for the metrics satisfying (very similar) Taub-NUT type conditions; (b) If $n=4$ there are two large classes of such Kerr type manifolds. Each class consists of manifolds fibering over open Riemann surfaces, equipped with a metric of constant Gaussian curvature $\kappa = 1$ or $\kappa = -1$. The first class includes a three parameter family of metrics admitting real analytic extensions to $(\mathbb R^3 \setminus\{0\}) \times \mathbb R = (S^2 \times \mathbb R_+) \times \mathbb R$ and a large class of other metrics not admitting this kind of extensions. The metrics of this first class admitting such extensions are all isometric to the well known Kerr metrics, with the three parameters corresponding to the three space-like components of the angular momentum of the gravitational field. The second class contains a subclass of metrics defined on $\big(\mathbb D\times \mathbb R_+\big)\times \mathbb R$, where $\mathbb D$ is the Lobachevsky Poincar\'e disc. This subclass is in bijection with the holomorphic functions on $\mathbb D$ satisfying an appropriate open condition. These and other results are consequences of a very simple way to construct totally explicit examples of Ricci flat Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Gepner's pioneering work, the requirement that leads to a model having the desired $N=1$ Spacetime supersymmetry and $E(8)\times E(6)$ Gauge symmetry was the requirement that the spacetime symmetry is compatible with modular invariance. In this work we show that the requirement for the simultaneous fulfillment of mutual locality of the left-moving vertices of physical states with the space-time symmetry generators and of right-moving vertices with generators of $E(8)\times E(6)$-gauge symmetry, which arises after some special reduction together with the requirement of mutual locality of complete (left-right) vertices of physical states among themselves leads to the same Gepner models.</description>

      <title>Framework for uncertainty quantification of wave-structure interaction in a flume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a numerical procedure for the quantification of uncertainties in wave-structure interaction. We utilise the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme for modelling the wave mechanics, coupled one-way with a finite element method (FEM) for the structural response. Physical wave flumes are extensively used in the study of hydrodynamics especially in wave-structure interaction (WSI) and prediction of forces to near-shore structures in disaster mitigation and offshore structures in the oil and gas, and more recently renewable energy sector. Over the years, numerical wave flumes have been developed extensively to enable the modelling of complex wave-structure interaction. However, most of these studies are deterministic and limited to using either simple flexible beams or rigid monolithic structures to model the structural part in the WSI. Additionally, uncertainties are commonly observed in both wave and structural parameters and need to be accounted for. This work presents a numerical framework to enable uncertainty quantification for wave-structure interaction problems in terms of the forces experienced by the structure. A one-way coupling between SPH with the FEM and uncertainty quantification (UQ) is proposed. We employ the so-called Tokyo wave flume geometry, which has potential for future surrogate modelling in WSI. The developed model is validated using numerical and experimental results from the literature and is used to demonstrate the prediction of probabilistic responses of structures under breaking and non-breaking wave scenarios.</description>
