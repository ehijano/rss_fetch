      <title>NeuroAssist: Enhancing Cognitive-Computer Synergy with Adaptive AI and Advanced Neural Decoding for Efficient EEG Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods of controlling prosthetics frequently encounter difficulties regarding flexibility and responsiveness, which can substantially impact people with varying cognitive and physical abilities. Advancements in computational neuroscience and machine learning (ML) have recently led to the development of highly advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that may be customized to meet individual requirements. To address these issues, we propose NeuroAssist, a sophisticated method for analyzing EEG data that merges state-of-the-art BCI technology with adaptable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. NeuroAssist's hybrid neural network design efficiently overcomes the constraints of conventional EEG data processing. Our methodology combines a Natural Language Processing (NLP) BERT model to extract complex features from numerical EEG data and utilizes LSTM networks to handle temporal dynamics. In addition, we integrate spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deep Q-networks (DQN) to improve decision-making and flexibility. Our preprocessing method classifies motor imagery (MI) one-versus-the-rest using a common spatial pattern (CSP) while preserving EEG temporal characteristics. The hybrid architecture of NeuroAssist serves as the DQN's Q-network, enabling continuous feedback-based improvement and adaptability. This enables it to acquire optimal actions through trial and error. This experimental analysis has been conducted on the GigaScience and BCI-competition-IV-2a datasets, which have shown exceptional effectiveness in categorizing MI-EEG signals, obtaining an impressive classification accuracy of 99.17%. NeuroAssist offers a crucial approach to current assistive technology by potentially enhancing the speed and versatility of BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Learning for Arousal and Sleep Stage Detection Using Fully Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Sleep is a critical physiological process that plays a vital role in maintaining physical and mental health. Accurate detection of arousals and sleep stages is essential for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, as frequent and excessive occurrences of arousals disrupt sleep stage patterns and lead to poor sleep quality, negatively impacting physical and mental health. Polysomnography is a traditional method for arousal and sleep stage detection that is time-consuming and prone to high variability among experts. Approach. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach for arousal and sleep stage detection using fully convolutional neural networks. Our model, FullSleepNet, accepts a full-night single-channel EEG signal as input and produces segmentation masks for arousal and sleep stage labels. FullSleepNet comprises four modules: a convolutional module to extract local features, a recurrent module to capture long-range dependencies, an attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of the input, and a segmentation module to output final predictions. Main results. By unifying the two interrelated tasks as segmentation problems and employing a multi-task learning approach, FullSleepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for arousal detection with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.70 on Sleep Heart Health Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis datasets. For sleep stage classification, FullSleepNet obtains comparable performance on both datasets, achieving an accuracy of 0.88 on the former and an accuracy of 0.83 on the latter. Significance. Our results demonstrate that FullSleepNet offers improved practicality, efficiency, and accuracy for the detection of arousal and classification of sleep stages using raw EEG signals as input.</description>

      <title>Interbeat Interval Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interbeat intervals (IBIs) carry heart rate and heartrate variability information. When the IBIs are correct, this information can be extracted through simple statistics such as mean/median/standard deviation. However, more robust approaches are needed especially in ambulatory conditions where the underlying signal can be noisy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight filter that (i) tracks the time-varying distribution of interbeat intervals, (ii) is robust to outliers. The tracked distribution summarizes relevant information of interest and alleviates the need for further analysis. We demonstrate numerically that the tracked distribution can provide more accurate estimates than a two-stage algorithm that first fixes the IBIs before computing the statistics of interest.</description>

      <title>Cell-free massive MIMO Channels in an Urban Environment -- Measurements and Channel Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO), where each user equipment (UE) is connected to multiple access points (APs), is emerging as an important component for 5G and 6G cellular systems. Accurate channel models based on measurements are required to optimize their design and deployment. This paper presents an extensive measurement campaign for CF-mMIMO in an urban environment. A new "virtual AP" technique measures channels between 80 UE locations and more than 20,000 possible microcellular AP locations. Measurements are done at 3.5 GHz carrier frequency with 350 MHz bandwidth (BW). The paper describes the measurement setup and data processing, shows sample results and their physical interpretation, and provides statistics for key quantities such as pathloss, shadowing, delay spread (DS), and delay window. We find pathloss coefficients of 2.9 and 10.4 for line-of-sight (LOS) and non line-of-sight (NLOS), respectively, where the high LOS coefficient is mainly because larger distance leads to more grazing angle of incidence and thus lower antenna gain in our setup. Shadowing standard deviations are 5.1/16.6 dB, and root mean squared (RMS) DSs of -80.6/-72.6 dBs. The measurements can also be used for parameterizing a CUNEC-type model, which will be reported in future work.</description>

      <title>High-speed odour sensing using miniaturised electronic nose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01904v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals have evolved to rapidly detect and recognise brief and intermittent encounters with odour packages, exhibiting recognition capabilities within milliseconds. Artificial olfaction has faced challenges in achieving comparable results -- existing solutions are either slow; or bulky, expensive, and power-intensive -- limiting applicability in real-world scenarios for mobile robotics. Here we introduce a miniaturised high-speed electronic nose; characterised by high-bandwidth sensor readouts, tightly controlled sensing parameters and powerful algorithms. The system is evaluated on a high-fidelity odour delivery benchmark. We showcase successful classification of tens-of-millisecond odour pulses, and demonstrate temporal pattern encoding of stimuli switching with up to 60 Hz. Those timescales are unprecedented in miniaturised low-power settings, and demonstrably exceed the performance observed in mice. For the first time, it is possible to match the temporal resolution of animal olfaction in robotic systems. This will allow for addressing challenges in environmental and industrial monitoring, security, neuroscience, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Hybrid Cellular and Cell-free MIMO Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free wireless communication is envisioned as one of the most promising network architectures, which can achieve stable and uniform communication performance while improving the system energy and spectrum efficiency. The deployment of cell-free networks is envisioned to be a longterm evolutionary process, in which cell-free access points (APs) will be gradually introduced into the communication network and collaborate with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). To further explore the performance limits of hybrid cellular and cell-free networks, this paper develops a hybrid network model based on stochastic geometric toolkits, which reveals the coupling of the signal and interference from both the cellular and cell-free networks. Specifically, the conjugate beamforming is applied in hybrid cellular and cell-free networks, which enables user equipment (UE) to benefit from both cellular BSs and cell-free APs. The aggregate signal received from the hybrid network is approximated via moment matching, and coverage probability is characterized by deriving the Laplace transform of the interference. The analysis of signal strength and coverage probability is verified by extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Pareto Optimal Hybrid Beamforming for Short-Packet Millimeter-Wave Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pareto optimal solutions are conceived for radar beamforming error (RBE) and sum rate maximization in short-packet (SP) millimeter-wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Our ultimate goal is to realize ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) and real-time sensing capabilities for 6G applications. The ISAC base station (BS) transmits short packets in the downlink (DL) to serve multiple communication users (CUs) and detect multiple radar targets (RTs). We investigate the performance trade-off between the sensing and communication capabilities by optimizing both the radio frequency (RF) and the baseband (BB) transmit precoder (TPC), together with the block lengths. The optimization problem considers the minimum rate requirements of the CUs, the maximum tolerable radar beamforming error (RBE) for the RTs, the unit modulus (UM) elements of the RF TPC, and the finite transmit power as the constraints for SP transmission. The resultant problem is highly non-convex due to the intractable rate expression of the SP regime coupled with the non-convex rate and UM constraints. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative two-layer bisection search (TLBS) algorithm, wherein the RF and BB TPCs are optimized in the inner layer, followed by the block length in the outer layer. Furthermore, a pair of novel methods, namely a bisection search-based majorizer and minimizer (BMM) as well as exact penalty-based manifold optimization (EPMO) are harnessed for optimizing the RF TPC in the inner layer. Subsequently, the BB TPC and the block length are derived via second-order cone programming (SOCP) and mixed integer programming methods, respectively. Finally, our exhaustive simulation results reveal the effect of system parameters for various settings on the RBE-rate region of the SP mmWave ISAC system and demonstrate a significantly enhanced performance compared to the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Air-borne Network-in-a-box Deployment for Efficient Remote Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among many envisaged drivers for the sixth generation, one is from the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals 2030 to eliminate digital inequality. Remote coverage in sparsely populated areas, difficult terrains, or emergency scenarios requires on-demand access and flexible deployment with minimal capex and opex. In this context, network-in-a-box (NIB) is an exciting solution that packs the whole wireless network into a single portable and re-configurable box to support multiple access technologies such as WiFi/2G/3G/4G/5G etc. In this paper, we propose low-altitude platform stations (LAPS) based NIBs with stratospheric high-altitude platform station (HAPS) as backhaul. Specifically, backhaul employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with superposition coding at the transmitting HAPS and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiving NIBs, whereas the access link (AL) employs superposition coding along with the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding at the NIB in order to elevate the computational overhead from the ground users. The required number of airborne NIBs to serve a desired coverage area, their optimal placement, user association, beam optimization, and resource allocation are optimized by maximizing the sum rate of the AL while maintaining the quality of service. Our findings reveal the significance of thorough system planning and communication parameters optimization for enhanced system performance and best coverage under limited resources.</description>

      <title>System Design and Parameter Optimization for Remote Coverage from NOMA-based High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stratospheric solar-powered high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) have recently gained immense popularity for their ubiquitous connectivity and resilient operation while providing/catalyzing advanced mobile wireless communication services. They have particularly emerged as promising alternatives for economic coverage of remote areas in the world. This makes them suitable candidates to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-2030) for global connectivity. HAPS can provide line-of-sight (LoS) communications to the ground users in its ultra-wide coverage area. We propose to divide these users into multiple user groups and serve each group with a high-density flexible narrow spot beam, generated by the phased array antennas mounted on HAPS, to achieve high data rates. We carry out the user association and power allocation in a downlink (DL) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme in each user group. To improve the system performance, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing user grouping, user association, beam optimization, and power allocation while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) for users with limited power budget. We further investigate the outage performance of the users with the proposed approach as compared to the traditional scheme. Our findings reveal the significance of the joint design of communication parameters for enhanced system performance, optimum energy utilization, and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>A DAFT Based Unified Waveform Design Framework for High-Mobility Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for multi-carrier communication in high-mobility scenarios, it is urgent to design new multi-carrier communication waveforms that can resist large delay-Doppler spreads. Various multi-carrier waveforms in the transform domain were proposed for the fast time-varying channels, including orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Among these, the AFDM is a strong candidate for its low implementation complexity and ability to achieve optimal diversity. This paper unifies the waveforms based on the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) by using the chirp slope factor "k" in the time-frequency representation to construct a unified design framework for high-mobility communications. The design framework is employed to verify that the bit error rate performance of the DAFT-based waveform can be enhanced when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high by adjusting the chirp slope factor "k".</description>

      <title>OFDM-Based Active STAR-RIS-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which consists of numerous passive elements, has recently emerged in wireless communication systems as a promising technology providing 360$^\circ$ coverage and better performance. In our research, we introduce an active STAR-RIS (ASTARS)-aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system designed to optimize the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enhancing detection and signal transmission efficiency. The introduction of an ISAC system aims to improve both communication efficiency and sensing capabilities. Also, we employ orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to address the frequency-selective fading problem. Furthermore, we evaluate the radar sensing capabilities by examining the range and velocity, and assess the performance through the mean-squared error (MSE) of their estimations. Our simulation results demonstrate that ASTARS outperforms STAR-RIS in our system configurations, and that the proposed optimization approach further enhances the system performance. Additionally, we confirm that an increase in the subcarrier spacing can reduce the transmission bit error rate (BER) under high-velocity conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access with Integrated Sensing and Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) system is introduced herein. This system features a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) that seamlessly merges sensing with backscatter communication and supports multiple users. Multiple access (MA) for the user is provided by employing rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA, unlike other classical orthogonal and non-orthogonal MA schemes, splits messages into common and private streams. With RSMA, the set of common rate forms can be optimized to reduce interference. Optimized formulas are thus derived for communication rates for users, tags, and the BS's sensing rate, with the primary goal of enhancing the transmission efficiency of the BS. The optimization task involves minimizing the BS's overall transmission power by jointly optimizing the BS's beamforming vectors, the tag reflection coefficients, and user common rates. The alternating optimization method is employed to address this challenge. Concrete solutions are provided for the received beamformers, and semi-definite relaxation and slack-optimization techniques are adopted for transmit beamformers and reflection coefficients, respectively. For example, the proposed RSMA-assisted ISABC system achieves a 350% communication rate boost over a nonorthogonal multiple access-assisted ISABC, with only a 24% increase in transmit power, leveraging ten transmit/reception antennas at the BS.</description>

      <title>iKAN: Global Incremental Learning with KAN for Human Activity Recognition Across Heterogeneous Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an incremental learning (IL) framework for wearable sensor human activity recognition (HAR) that tackles two challenges simultaneously: catastrophic forgetting and non-uniform inputs. The scalable framework, iKAN, pioneers IL with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to replace multi-layer perceptrons as the classifier that leverages the local plasticity and global stability of splines. To adapt KAN for HAR, iKAN uses task-specific feature branches and a feature redistribution layer. Unlike existing IL methods that primarily adjust the output dimension or the number of classifier nodes to adapt to new tasks, iKAN focuses on expanding the feature extraction branches to accommodate new inputs from different sensor modalities while maintaining consistent dimensions and the number of classifier outputs. Continual learning across six public HAR datasets demonstrated the iKAN framework's incremental learning performance, with a last performance of 84.9\% (weighted F1 score) and an average incremental performance of 81.34\%, which significantly outperforms the two existing incremental learning methods, such as EWC (51.42\%) and experience replay (59.92\%).</description>

      <title>An efficient solution to Hidden Markov Models on trees with coupled branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data, where the underlying states evolve in a stochastic manner and are only indirectly observable. Traditional HMM approaches are well-established for linear sequences, and have been extended to other structures such as trees. In this paper, we extend the framework of HMMs on trees to address scenarios where the tree-like structure of the data includes coupled branches -- a common feature in biological systems where entities within the same lineage exhibit dependent characteristics. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves the likelihood, decoding, and parameter learning problems for tree-based HMMs with coupled branches. Our approach scales polynomially with the number of states and nodes, making it computationally feasible for a wide range of applications and does not suffer from the underflow problem. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to simulated data and propose self-consistency checks for validating the assumptions of the model used for inference. This work not only advances the theoretical understanding of HMMs on trees but also provides a practical tool for analyzing complex biological data where dependencies between branches cannot be ignored.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for collaborative wideband spectrum sensing and scheduling for networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which act as the secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically utilize detected "spectrum holes". Our overall framework consists of three main stages. Firstly, in the model training stage, we explore dataset generation in a multi-cell environment and training a machine learning (ML) model using the federated learning (FL) architecture. Unlike the existing studies on FL for wireless that presume datasets are readily available for training, we propose a novel architecture that directly integrates wireless dataset generation, which involves capturing I/Q samples from over-the-air signals in a multi-cell environment, into the FL training process. Secondly, in the collaborative spectrum inference stage, we propose a collaborative spectrum fusion strategy that is compatible with the unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) ecosystem. Finally, in the spectrum scheduling stage, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to dynamically allocate the detected spectrum holes to the secondary users. To evaluate the proposed methods, we establish a comprehensive simulation framework that generates a near-realistic synthetic dataset using MATLAB LTE toolbox by incorporating base-station~(BS) locations in a chosen area of interest, performing ray-tracing, and emulating the primary users channel usage in terms of I/Q samples. This evaluation methodology provides a flexible framework to generate large spectrum datasets that could be used for developing ML/AI-based spectrum management solutions for aerial devices.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis and Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Extended Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a multi-antenna base station transmits beamformed signals for joint downlink multi-user communication and radar sensing of an extended target (ET). By considering echo signals as reflections from valid elements on the ET contour, a set of novel Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) is derived for parameter estimation of the ET, including central range, direction, and orientation. The ISAC transmit beamforming design is then formulated as an optimization problem, aiming to minimize the CRB associated with radar sensing, while satisfying a minimum signal-to-interference-pulse-noise ratio requirement for each communication user, along with a 3-dB beam coverage constraint tailored for the ET. To solve this non-convex problem, we utilize semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and propose a rank-one solution extraction scheme for non-tight relaxation circumstances. To reduce the computation complexity, we further employ an efficient zero-forcing (ZF) based beamforming design, where the sensing task is performed in the null space of communication channels. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the obtained CRB, revealing the diverse features of CRB for differently shaped ETs. The proposed SDR beamforming design outperforms benchmark designs with lower estimation error and CRB, while the ZF beamforming design greatly improves computation efficiency with minor sensing performance loss.</description>

      <title>Advancing Ultra-Reliable 6G: Transformer and Semantic Localization Empowered Robust Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in 6G wireless technology have elevated the importance of beamforming, especially for attaining ultra-high data rates via millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency deployment. Although promising, mmWave bands require substantial beam training to achieve precise beamforming. While initial deep learning models that use RGB camera images demonstrated promise in reducing beam training overhead, their performance suffers due to sensitivity to lighting and environmental variations. Due to this sensitivity, Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuates, eventually affecting the stability and dependability of networks in dynamic environments. This emphasizes a critical need for more robust solutions. This paper proposes a robust beamforming technique to ensure consistent QoS under varying environmental conditions. An optimization problem has been formulated to maximize users' data rates. To solve the formulated NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: the semantic localization problem and the optimal beam selection problem. To solve the semantic localization problem, we propose a novel method that leverages the k-means clustering and YOLOv8 model. To solve the beam selection problem, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid architecture that utilizes various data sources and a weighted entropy-based mechanism to predict the optimal beams. Rapid and accurate beam predictions are needed to maintain QoS. A novel metric, Accuracy-Complexity Efficiency (ACE), has been proposed to quantify this. Six testing scenarios have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines regarding beam prediction accuracy, received power, and ACE in the developed test scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Photonic 32-Input Coherent Combiner for Turbulence Mitigation in Free Space Optics Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) for the coherent combination of 32 input optical signals into a single output fiber is reported. The PIC was fabricated using a low-loss thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process and packaged with 32 input and 1 output fibers. The basic building block is a 2x2 Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with an external (to the MZI branches) and an internal thermal phase shifter, and a bandwidth in excess of 80 kHz. The PIC monolithically integrates 31 MZIs and 31 germanium photodetectors, and is suitable in principle for turbulence mitigation in LEO-ground and horizontal free space optics links. Improvements to the device for the coherent combination of 64 inputs and for the reduction of insertion losses are also discussed</description>

      <title>MaskSR: Masked Language Model for Full-band Speech Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech restoration aims at restoring high quality speech in the presence of a diverse set of distortions. Although several deep learning paradigms have been studied for this task, the power of the recently emerging language models has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose MaskSR, a masked language model capable of restoring full-band 44.1 kHz speech jointly considering noise, reverb, clipping, and low bandwidth. MaskSR works with discrete acoustic tokens extracted using a pre-trained neural codec. During training, MaskSR is optimized to predict randomly masked tokens extracted from the high quality target speech, conditioned on the corrupted speech with various distortions. During inference, MaskSR reconstructs the target speech tokens with efficient iterative sampling. Extensive experiments show that MaskSR obtains competitive results on both the full-band speech restoration task and also on sub-tasks compared with a wide range of models.</description>

Abstract: A method to construct an observability-constrained magnetic-field-aided inertial navigation system is proposed. The proposed method builds upon the previously proposed observability-constrained extended Kalman filter and extends it to work with a magnetic-field-based odometry-aided inertial navigation system. The proposed method is evaluated using simulation and real-world data, showing that (i) the system observability properties are preserved, (ii) the estimation accuracy increases, and (iii) the perceived uncertainty calculated by the EKF is more consistent with the true uncertainty of the filter estimates.</description>

      <title>Sparse Recovery for Holographic MIMO Channels: Leveraging the Clustered Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Envisioned as the next-generation transceiver technology, the holographic multiple-input-multiple-output (HMIMO) garners attention for its superior capabilities of fabricating electromagnetic (EM) waves. However, the densely packed antenna elements significantly increase the dimension of the HMIMO channel matrix, rendering traditional channel estimation methods inefficient. While the dimension curse can be relieved to avoid the proportional increase with the antenna density using the state-of-the-art wavenumber-domain sparse representation, the sparse recovery complexity remains tied to the order of non-zero elements in the sparse channel, which still considerably exceeds the number of scatterers. By modeling the inherent clustered sparsity using a Gaussian mixed model (GMM)-based von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, the to-be-estimated channel characteristics can be compressed to the scatterer level. Upon the sparsity extraction, a novel wavenumber-domain expectation-maximization (WD-EM) algorithm is proposed to implement the cluster-by-cluster variational inference, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity. Simulation results verify the robustness of the proposed scheme across overheads and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</description>

      <title>ERes2NetV2: Boosting Short-Duration Speaker Verification Performance with Computational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker verification systems experience significant performance degradation when tasked with short-duration trial recordings. To address this challenge, a multi-scale feature fusion approach has been proposed to effectively capture speaker characteristics from short utterances. Constrained by the model's size, a robust backbone Enhanced Res2Net (ERes2Net) combining global and local feature fusion demonstrates sub-optimal performance in short-duration speaker verification. To further improve the short-duration feature extraction capability of ERes2Net, we expand the channel dimension within each stage. However, this modification also increases the number of model parameters and computational complexity. To alleviate this problem, we propose an improved ERes2NetV2 by pruning redundant structures, ultimately reducing both the model parameters and its computational cost. A range of experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb datasets exhibits the superiority of ERes2NetV2, which achieves EER of 0.61% for the full-duration trial, 0.98% for the 3s-duration trial, and 1.48% for the 2s-duration trial on VoxCeleb1-O, respectively.</description>

      <title>MIMO Capacity Maximization with Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) link assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS). We maximize the capacity by alternately optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, and the BD-RIS scattering matrix, which, according to network theory, should be unitary and symmetric. These constraints make the optimization of BD-RIS more challenging than that of diagonal RIS. To find a stationary point of the capacity we maximize a sequence of quadratic problems in the manifold of unitary matrices. This leads to an efficient algorithm that always improves the capacity obtained by a diagonal RIS. Through simulation examples, we study the capacity improvement provided by a passive BD-RIS architecture over the conventional RIS model in which the phase shift matrix is diagonal.</description>

      <title>A deep-learning-based MAC for integrating channel access, rate adaptation and channel switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing density and heterogeneity in unlicensed wireless networks, traditional MAC protocols, such as carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) in Wi-Fi networks, are experiencing performance degradation. This is manifested in increased collisions and extended backoff times, leading to diminished spectrum efficiency and protocol coordination. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based MAC paradigm, dubbed DL-MAC, which leverages spectrum sensing data readily available from energy detection modules in wireless devices to achieve the MAC functionalities of channel access, rate adaptation and channel switch. First, we utilize DL-MAC to realize a joint design of channel access and rate adaptation. Subsequently, we integrate the capability of channel switch into DL-MAC, enhancing its functionality from single-channel to multi-channel operation. Specifically, the DL-MAC protocol incorporates a deep neural network (DNN) for channel selection and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for the joint design of channel access and rate adaptation. We conducted real-world data collection within the 2.4 GHz frequency band to validate the effectiveness of DL-MAC, and our experiments reveal that DL-MAC exhibits superior performance over traditional algorithms in both single and multi-channel environments and also outperforms single-function approaches in terms of overall performance. Additionally, the performance of DL-MAC remains robust, unaffected by channel switch overhead within the evaluated range.</description>

Abstract: Train localization during Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) outages presents challenges for ensuring failsafe and accurate positioning in railway networks. This paper proposes a minimalist approach exploiting track geometry and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data. By integrating a discrete track map as a Look-Up Table (LUT) into a Particle Filter (PF) based solution, accurate train positioning is achieved with only an IMU sensor and track map data. The approach is tested on an open railway positioning data set, showing that accurate positioning (absolute errors below 10 m) can be maintained during GNSS outages up to 30 s in the given data. We simulate outages on different track segments and show that accurate positioning is reached during track curves and curvy railway lines. The approach can be used as a redundant complement to established positioning solutions to increase the position estimate's reliability and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for utilizing fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to minimize data requirements in load profile analysis, demonstrated through the restoration of missing data in power system load profiles. A two-stage fine-tuning strategy is proposed to adapt a pre-trained LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, for missing data restoration tasks. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned model in accurately restoring missing data, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art specifically designed models such as BERT-PIN. Key findings include the importance of prompt engineering and the optimal utilization of fine-tuning samples, highlighting the efficiency of few-shot learning in transferring knowledge from general user cases to specific target users. Furthermore, the proposed approach demonstrates notable cost-effectiveness and time efficiency compared to training models from scratch, making it a practical solution for scenarios with limited data availability and computing resources. This research has significant potential for application to other power system load profile analysis tasks. Consequently, it advances the use of LLMs in power system analytics, offering promising implications for enhancing the resilience and efficiency of power distribution systems.</description>

Abstract: In order to evaluate the performance of radar and communication systems in future wireless networks, accurate propagation models are needed to predict efficiently the received powers at each node, and draw correct conclusions. In this paper, we present new radar propagation models based on the electromagnetism theory. The target is modelled as a flat or curved square plate to compute the scattered field and derive accurate radar cross section modellings. With a flat square plate, the model makes the link between the radar equation and the geometrical optics propagation model used in ray-tracing applications. It is then applied to popular automotive scenarios within the stochastic geometry framework to observe the impact of such modelling.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which enables hardware, resources (e.g., spectra), and waveforms sharing, is becoming a key feature in future-generation communication systems. This paper investigates performance characterization and waveform design for ISAC systems when the underlying true communication channels are not accurately known. With uncertainty in a nominal communication channel, the nominal Pareto frontier of the sensing and communication performances cannot represent the true performance trade-off of a real-world operating ISAC system. Therefore, this paper portrays the robust (i.e., conservative) Pareto frontier considering the uncertainty in the communication channel. To be specific, the lower bound of the true (but unknown) Pareto frontier is investigated, technically by studying robust waveform design problems that find the best waveforms under the worst-case channels. The robust waveform design problems examined in this paper are shown to be non-convex and high-dimensional, which cannot be solved using existing optimization techniques. As such, we propose a computationally efficient solution framework to approximately solve them. Simulation results show that by solving the robust waveform design problems, the lower bound of the true but unknown Pareto frontier, which characterizes the sensing-communication performance trade-off under communication channel uncertainty, can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Plug-In RIS: A Novel Approach to Fully Passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a promising design concept for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), named plug-in RIS, wherein the RIS is plugged into an appropriate position in the environment, adjusted once according to the location of both base station and blocked region, and operates with fixed beams to enhance the system performance. The plug-in RIS is a novel system design, streamlining RIS-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication without requiring decoupling two parts of the end-to-end channel, traditional control signal transmission, and online RIS configuration. In plug-in RIS-aided transmission, the transmitter efficiently activates specific regions of the divided large RIS by employing hybrid beamforming techniques, each with predetermined phase adjustments tailored to reflect signals to desired user locations. This user-centric approach enhances connectivity and overall user experience by dynamically illuminating the targeted user based on location. By introducing plug-in RIS's theoretical framework, design principles, and performance evaluation, we demonstrate its potential to revolutionize mmWave communications for the limited channel state information (CSI) scenarios. Simulation results illustrate that plug-in RIS provides power/cost-efficient solutions to overcome blockage in the mmWave communication system and a striking convergence in average bit error rate and achievable rate performance with traditional full CSI-enabled RIS solutions.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel, Data and Radar Parameter Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new schemes for joint channel and data estimation (JCDE) and radar parameter estimation (RPE) in doubly-dispersive channels, such that integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is enabled by user equipment (UE) independently performing JCDE, and base stations (BSs) performing RPE. The contributed JCDE and RPE schemes are designed for waveforms known to perform well in doubly-dispersive channels, under a unified model that captures the features of either legacy orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), state-of-the-art (SotA) orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and next-generation affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) systems. The proposed JCDE algorithm is based on a Bayesian parametric bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (PBiGaBP) framework first proposed for OTFS and here shown to apply to all aforementioned waveforms, while the RPE scheme is based on a new probabilistic data association (PDA) approach incorporating a Bernoulli-Gaussian denoising, optimized via expectation maximization (EM). Simulation results demonstrate that JCDE in AFDM systems utilizing a single pilot per block significantly outperforms the SotA alternative even if the latter is granted a substantial power advantage. Similarly, the AFDM-based RPE scheme is found to outperform the OTFS-based approach, as well as the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) technique, regardless of the waveform used.</description>

Abstract: Periodic signals composed of periodic mixtures admit sparse representations in nested periodic dictionaries (NPDs). Therefore, their underlying hidden periods can be estimated by recovering the exact support of said representations. In this paper, support recovery guarantees of such signals are derived both in noise-free and noisy settings. While exact recovery conditions have been studied in the theory of compressive sensing, existing conditions fall short of yielding meaningful achievability regions in the context of periodic signals with sparse representations in NPDs, in part since existing bounds do not capture structures intrinsic to these dictionaries. We leverage known properties of NPDs to derive several conditions for exact sparse recovery of periodic mixtures in the noise-free setting. These conditions rest on newly introduced notions of nested periodic coherence and restricted coherence, which can be efficiently computed. In the presence of noise, we obtain improved conditions for recovering the exact support set of the sparse representation of the periodic mixture via orthogonal matching pursuit based on the introduced notions of coherence. The theoretical findings are corroborated using numerical experiments for different families of NPDs. Our results show significant improvement over generic recovery bounds as the conditions hold over a larger range of sparsity levels.</description>

      <title>Long-term usage of the off-grid photovoltaic system with lithium-ion battery-based energy storage system on high mountains: A case study in Payiun Lodge on Mt. Jade in Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04225</link>

Abstract: Energy supply on high mountains remains an open issue since grid connection is unavailable. In the past, diesel generators with lead-acid battery energy storage systems (ESSs) are applied in most cases. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) system with lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery ESS is an appropriate method for solving this problem in a greener way. In 2016, an off-grid PV system with Li-ion battery ESS has been installed in Paiyun Lodge on Mt. Jade (the highest lodge in Taiwan). After operation for more than 7 years, the aging problem of the whole electric power system becomes a critical issue for long-term usage. In this work, a method is established for analyzing the massive energy data (over 7 million rows) and estimating the health of the Li-ion battery system, such as daily operation patterns as well as C-rate, temperature, and accumulated energy distributions. The accomplished electric power improvement project dealing with the power system aging is reported. Based on the long-term usage experience, a simple cost analysis model between lead-acid and Li-ion battery systems is built, explaining that the expensive Li-ion batteries can compete with the cheap lead-acid batteries for long-term usage on high mountains. This case study provides engineers and researchers a fundamental understanding of the long-term usage of off-grid PV ESSs and engineering on high mountains.</description>

      <title>Reflection Map Construction: Enhancing and Speeding Up Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an indoor localization method using fixed reflector objects within the environment, leveraging a base station (BS) equipped with Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurement capabilities. The localization process includes two phases. In the offline phase, we identify effective reflector points within a specific region using significantly fewer test points than typical methods. In the online phase, we solve a maximization problem to locate users based on BS measurements and offline phase information. We introduce the reflectivity parameter (\(n_r\)), which quantifies the typical number of first-order reflection paths from the transmitter to the receiver, demonstrating its impact on localization accuracy. The log-scale accuracy ratio (\(R_a\)) is defined as the logarithmic function of the localization area divided by the localization ambiguity area, serving as an accuracy indicator. We show that in scenarios where the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) approaches infinity, without a line of sight (LoS) link, \(R_a\) is upper-bounded by \(n_r \log_{2}\left(1 + \frac{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_A)}{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}(\mathcal{M}_s))}\right)\). Here, \(\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_A)\) and \(\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{S}_{\epsilon}(\mathcal{M}_s))\) represent the areas of the localization region and the area containing all reflector points with a probability of at least \(1 - \epsilon\), respectively.</description>
