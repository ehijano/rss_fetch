      <title>Joint Delay-Doppler Estimation using OFDMA Payloads for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of future communication systems for sensing offers the potential for a number of new applications. In this paper, we show that leveraging user data payloads in multi-node Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) networks for estimating target delay and Doppler-shift parameters can yield a significant advantage in SNR and addressable bandwidth. However, gaps in the frequency-time resources, reference signal boosting and amplitude modulation schemes introduce challenges for estimation at the sensing receiver.
  In this work, we propose a joint delay and Doppler-shift model-based estimator designed to address these challenges. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of the device model into the estimation procedure helps mitigate the effects of the non-ideal radar ambiguity function caused by amplitude-modulated user payloads and sparse reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the estimator achieves the theoretical lower bound on estimation variance.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Model/Data-Driven Solution to Channel, Position and Orientation Tracking in mmWave Vehicular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel tracking in millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicular systems is crucial for maintaining robust vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication links, which can be leveraged to achieve high accuracy vehicle position and orientation tracking as a byproduct of communication. While prior work tends to simplify the system model by omitting critical system factors such as clock offsets, filtering effects, antenna array orientation offsets, and channel estimation errors, we address the challenges of a practical mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system between a single base station (BS) and a vehicle while tracking the vehicle's position and orientation (PO) considering realistic driving behaviors. We first develop a channel tracking algorithm based on multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) with factoring (F-MOMP) to reduce computational complexity and enable high-resolution channel estimates during the tracking stage, suitable for PO estimation. Then, we develop a network called VO-ChAT (Vehicle Orientation-Channel Attention for orientation Tracking), which processes the channel estimate sequence for orientation prediction. Afterward, a weighted least squares (WLS) problem that exploits the channel geometry is formulated to create an initial estimate of the vehicle's 2D position. A second network named VP-ChAT (Vehicle Position-Channel Attention for position Tracking) refines the geometric position estimate. VP-ChAT is a Transformer inspired network processing the historical channel and position estimates to provide the correction for the initial geometric position estimate. The proposed solution is evaluated using raytracing generated channels in an urban canyon environment. For 80% of the cases it achieves a 2D position tracking accuracy of 26 cm while orientation errors are kept below 0.5 degree.</description>

      <title>Cross-Layer-Optimized Link Selection for Hologram Video Streaming over Millimeter Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic-type communication brings an immersive tele-holography experience by delivering holographic contents to users. As the direct representation of holographic contents, hologram videos are naturally three-dimensional representation, which consist of a huge volume of data. Advanced multi-connectivity (MC) millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks are now available to transmit hologram videos by providing the necessary bandwidth. However, the existing link selection schemes in MC-based mmWave networks neglect the source content characteristics of hologram videos and the coordination among the parameters of different protocol layers in each link, leading to sub-optimal streaming performance. To address this issue, we propose a cross-layer-optimized link selection scheme for hologram video streaming over mmWave networks. This scheme optimizes link selection by jointly adjusting the video coding bitrate, the modulation and channel coding schemes (MCS), and link power allocation to minimize the end-to-end hologram distortion while guaranteeing the synchronization and quality balance between real and imaginary components of the hologram. Results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the hologram video streaming performance in terms of PSNR by 1.2dB to 6.4dB against the non-cross-layer scheme.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Electromagnetic Stealth over Extended Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to traditional electromagnetic stealth (ES) materials, which are effective only within specific frequencies and orientations, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology introduces a novel paradigm for achieving dynamic and adaptive ES by adapting its reflection pattern in real time to neutralize radar probing signals echoed back from the target. In this letter, we study an IRS-aided ES system mounted on an aerial target to evade radar detection admist uncertain/moving radar positions over an extended area. Specifically, we aim to optimize the IRS's passive reflection to minimize the maximum received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target echo signal in the area. A semi-closed-form solution is derived by first discretizing the continuous spatial frequency deviation to approximate the semi-infinite reflection gain constraint and then leveraging the Lagrange dual method. Simulation results are provided to validate that the proposed IRS-aided ES strategy can consistently reduce the reflection gains for radars located across a large region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) in uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, wherein multiple devices perform target sensing and over-the-air computation (AirComp) simultaneously. We aim to minimize the computational mean squared error (MSE) by jointly optimizing the transmitting vector and the aggregation vector. To tackle the non-convexity of this problem, we develop a two-phase iterative algorithm. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Learning Networks in the Presence of DVL Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation is a critical aspect of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in complex underwater environments. Since global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable underwater, navigation relies on inertial sensing, which tends to accumulate errors over time. To mitigate this, the Doppler velocity log (DVL) plays a crucial role in determining navigation accuracy. In this paper, we compare two neural network models: an adapted version of BeamsNet, based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, and a Spectrally Normalized Memory Neural Network (SNMNN). The former focuses on extracting spatial features, while the latter leverages memory and temporal features to provide more accurate velocity estimates while handling biased and noisy DVL data. The proposed approaches were trained and tested on real AUV data collected in the Mediterranean Sea. Both models are evaluated in terms of accuracy and estimation certainty and are benchmarked against the least squares (LS) method, the current model-based approach. The results show that the neural network models achieve over a 50% improvement in RMSE for the estimation of the AUV velocity, with a smaller standard deviation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) is an emerging technology that uses the new form of shape- and position-reconfigurable antennas to empower the physical layer for wireless communications. Prior studies on FAS were however limited to narrowband channels. Motivated by this, this paper addresses the integration of FAS in the fifth generation (5G) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) framework to address the challenges posed by wideband communications. We propose the framework of the wideband FAS OFDM system that includes a novel port selection matrix. Then we derive the achievable rate expression and design the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme based on the rate. Extensive link-level simulation results demonstrate striking improvements of FAS in the wideband channels, underscoring the potential of FAS in future wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Free Sensing and Context Recognition Using Photovoltaic Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of energy-free sensing and context recognition has recently gained significant attention as it allows operating systems without external power sources. Photovoltaic cells can convert light energy into electrical energy to power sensing devices, but their power may not be sufficient to ensure energy-free sensing due to the varying power needs of sensors and high computational demands. In this paper, we propose the use of photovoltaic cells as a standalone sensor for the recognition of different contexts, including user identification, step counting, and location tracking. The system utilizes the photocurrent readings generated by the photovoltaic cells to capture the unique mobility patterns of different users. By analyzing these patterns, the system can accurately identify the user, count the number of steps taken, and track the user's location. We propose a computationally efficient DTW to match the variable length sequences of photocurrent readings to a database of known patterns and identify the closest subject and location matches. The system was rigorously evaluated in a realistic environment, and the results indicate that it can accurately estimate step count, identify subjects, and localize them with an accuracy of 88%, 90%, and 43cm, respectively. This is achieved while the proposed system is non-intrusive and can operate without external power sources, making it a promising technology for energy-free sensing and context recognition.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Approach for Extending Automotive Radar Operation to NLOS Urban Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive radar is a key component of sensing suites in autonomous driving (AD) and advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS). However, limited line-of-sight (LOS) significantly reduces radar efficiency in dense urban environments. Therefore, automotive radars need to extend their capabilities beyond LOS by localizing occluding and reflective surfaces and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) targets. This work addresses the NLOS target localization challenge by revisiting the NLOS radar signal propagation model and introducing a hybrid localization approach. The proposed approach first detects and localizes reflective surfaces, then identifies the LOS/NLOS propagation conditions, and finally localizes the target without prior scene knowledge, without using Doppler information, and without any auxiliary sensors. The proposed hybrid approach addresses the computational complexity challenge by integrating a physical radar electromagnetic wave propagation model with a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate occluding surface parameters. The efficiency of the proposed approach to localize the NLOS targets and to identify the NLOS/LOS propagation conditions is evaluated via simulations in a broad range of realistic automotive scenarios. Extending automotive radar sensing beyond LOS is expected to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous and ADAS-equipped vehicles.</description>

      <title>Hiding in Plain Sight: RIS-Aided Target Obfuscation in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been identified as a promising technology for the sixth generation (6G) of communication networks. Target privacy in ISAC is essential to ensure that only legitimate sensors can detect the target while keeping it hidden from malicious ones. In this paper, we consider a downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC system capable of protecting a sensing region against an adversarial detector. The RIS consists of both reflecting and sensing elements, adaptively changing the element assignment based on system needs. To achieve this, we minimize the maximum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the adversarial detector within sample points in the sensing region, by optimizing the transmit beamformer at the base station, the RIS phase shift matrix, the received beamformer at the RIS, and the division between reflecting and absorptive elements at the RIS, where the latter function as sensing elements. At the same time, the system is designed to maintain a minimum sensing SINR at each monitored location, as well as minimum communication SINR for each user. To solve this challenging optimization problem, we develop an alternating optimization approach combined with a successive convex approximation based method tailored for each subproblem. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves a 25 dB reduction in the maximum sensing SINR at the adversarial detector compared to scenarios without sensing area protection. Also, the optimal RIS element assignment can further improve sensing protection by 3 dB over RISs with fixed element configuration.</description>

      <title>Deep Frequency Attention Networks for Single Snapshot Sparse Array Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse arrays have been widely exploited in radar systems because of their advantages in achieving large array aperture at low hardware cost, while significantly reducing mutual coupling. However, sparse arrays suffer from high sidelobes which may lead to false detections. Missing elements in sparse arrays can be interpolated using the sparse array measurements. In snapshot-limited scenarios, such as automotive radar, it is challenging to utilize difference coarrays which require a large number of snapshots to construct a covariance matrix for interpolation. For single snapshot sparse array interpolation, traditional model-based methods, while effective, require expert knowledge for hyperparameter tuning, lack task-specific adaptability, and incur high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based single snapshot sparse array interpolation network that addresses these challenges by leveraging a frequency-domain attention mechanism. The proposed approach transforms the sparse signal into the frequency domain, where the attention mechanism focuses on key spectral regions, enabling improved interpolation of missing elements even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. By minimizing computational costs and enhancing interpolation accuracy, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional approaches, making it well-suited for automotive radar applications.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification Using Denoise Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents increasing challenges due to their limited computational and energy resources. Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) emerges as a promising authentication technique to identify wireless devices through hardware impairments. RFFI performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios is significantly degraded because the minute hardware features can be easily swamped in noise. In this paper, we leveraged the diffusion model to effectively restore the RFF under low SNR scenarios. Specifically, we trained a powerful noise predictor and tailored a noise removal algorithm to effectively reduce the noise level in the received signal and restore the device fingerprints. We used Wi-Fi as a case study and created a testbed involving 6 commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi dongles and a USRP N210 software-defined radio (SDR) platform. We conducted experimental evaluations on various SNR scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the classification accuracy by up to 34.9%.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Beamforming Design for Stable Millimeter-Wave Communications Under Blockages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines analog beamforming designs utilizing multi-panel arrays for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems under stochastic path blockages where each panel is an integrated circuit that includes power amplifiers, a limited number of antenna elements, and the corresponding phase shifters. In existing commercial mmWave systems, analog beams are typically designed by leveraging all panels cooperatively to align with the line-of-sight (LoS) path, thereby maximizing array gain. Although this beam design is effective in static channels, it is highly susceptible to frequent link disconnections caused by sudden path blockages. To address this challenge, the present study revisits the design of analog beamforming and proposes a multi-beam approach using multi-panel arrays to enhance robustness to path blockages. To evaluate the performance of the multi-beam with multimodal directivity, a theoretical analysis of the outage probability of the spectral efficiency (SE) is conducted. To design the optimal multi-beam based on the derived outage probability, we formulate a panel allocation problem to determine the assignment of panels to specific paths, including both LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Numerical simulations confirm that the optimal beam, at high target SE, comprises a single sharp beam aligned to the LoS path to maximize array gain, whereas the optimal beam at low target SE is a multi-beam aligned to both the LoS and NLoS paths to acquire spatial diversity. These results demonstrate that the proposed multi-beam design, which utilizes multiple paths, effectively enhances the stability of mmWave communications while ensuring a minimum required performance level.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Human Pose Reconstruction from Wearable Sensors for 6G Extended Reality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full 3D human pose reconstruction is a critical enabler for extended reality (XR) applications in future sixth generation (6G) networks, supporting immersive interactions in gaming, virtual meetings, and remote collaboration. However, achieving accurate pose reconstruction over wireless networks remains challenging due to channel impairments, bit errors, and quantization effects. Existing approaches often assume error-free transmission in indoor settings, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for human pose reconstruction over orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The framework introduces a two-stage deep learning receiver: the first stage jointly estimates the wireless channel and decodes OFDM symbols, and the second stage maps the received sensor signals to full 3D body poses. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed neural receiver reduces bit error rate (BER), thus gaining a 5 dB gap at $10^{-4}$ BER, compared to the baseline method that employs separate signal detection steps, i.e., least squares channel estimation and linear minimum mean square error equalization. Additionally, our empirical findings show that 8-bit quantization is sufficient for accurate pose reconstruction, achieving a mean squared error of $5\times10^{-4}$ for reconstructed sensor signals, and reducing joint angular error by 37\% for the reconstructed human poses compared to the baseline.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes two approaches for overcoming access points' phase misalignment effects in the downlink of cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems. The first approach is based on the differential space-time block coding technique, while the second one is based on the use of differential modulation schemes. Both approaches are shown to perform exceptionally well and to restore system performance in CF-mMIMO systems where phase alignment at the access points for downlink joint coherent transmission cannot be achieved.</description>

Abstract: Musical source separation (MSS) has recently seen a big breakthrough in separating instruments from a mixture in the context of Western music, but research on non-Western instruments is still limited due to a lack of data. In this demo, we use an existing dataset of Brazilian sama percussion to create artificial mixtures for training a U-Net model to separate the surdo drum, a traditional instrument in samba. Despite limited training data, the model effectively isolates the surdo, given the drum's repetitive patterns and its characteristic low-pitched timbre. These results suggest that MSS systems can be successfully harnessed to work in more culturally-inclusive scenarios without the need of collecting extensive amounts of data.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi 6 Cross-Technology Interference Detection and Mitigation by OFDMA: an Experimental Study</title>

Abstract: Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) poses challenges for the performance and robustness of wireless networks. There are opportunities for better cooperation if the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected. Namely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate resources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a single Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet demodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI on low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a wired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester, while running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use openwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio (SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a CTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection feedback to the AP. We show experimentally that it can fully mitigate the 35% throughput loss caused by CTI when the AP applies the appropriate scheduling.</description>

Abstract: The advance towards 6G networks comes with the promise of unprecedented performance in sensing and communication capabilities. The feat of achieving those, while satisfying the ever-growing demands placed on wireless networks, promises revolutionary advancements in sensing and communication technologies. As 6G aims to cater to the growing demands of wireless network users, the implementation of intelligent and efficient solutions becomes essential. In particular, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), also known as Smart Surfaces, are envisioned as a transformative technology for future 6G networks. The performance of RISs when used to augment existing devices is nevertheless largely affected by their precise location. Suboptimal deployments are also costly to correct, negating their low-cost benefits. This paper investigates the topic of optimal RISs diffusion, taking into account the improvement they provide both for the sensing and communication capabilities of the infrastructure while working with other antennas and sensors. We develop a combined metric that takes into account the properties and location of the individual devices to compute the performance of the entire infrastructure. We then use it as a foundation to build a reinforcement learning architecture that solves the RIS deployment problem. Since our metric measures the surface where given localization thresholds are achieved and the communication coverage of the area of interest, the novel framework we provide is able to seamlessly balance sensing and communication, showing its performance gain against reference solutions, where it achieves simultaneously almost the reference performance for communication and the reference performance for localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is an algorithm capable of handling nonlinear scenarios. Uncertainty in process noise covariance may decrease the filter estimation performance or even lead to its divergence. Therefore, it is important to adjust the process noise covariance matrix in real time. In this paper, we developed an adaptive neural unscented Kalman filter to cope with time-varying uncertainties during platform operation. To this end, we devised ProcessNet, a simple yet efficient end-to-end regression network to adaptively estimate the process noise covariance matrix. We focused on the nonlinear inertial sensor and Doppler velocity log fusion problem in the case of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation. Using a real-world recorded dataset from an autonomous underwater vehicle, we demonstrated our filter performance and showed its advantages over other adaptive and non-adaptive nonlinear filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for a variety of commercial, civilian, and defense applications has increased many folds in recent years. While UAVs are expected to transform future air operations, there are instances where they can be used for malicious purposes. In this context, the detection, classification, and tracking (DCT) of UAVs (DCT-U) for safety and surveillance of national air space is a challenging task when compared to DCT of manned aerial vehicles. In this survey, we discuss the threats and challenges from malicious UAVs and we subsequently study three radio frequency (RF)-based systems for DCT-U. These RF-based systems include radars, communication systems, and RF analyzers. Radar systems are further divided into conventional and modern radar systems, while communication systems can be used for joint communications and sensing (JC&amp;S) in active mode and act as a source of illumination to passive radars for DCT-U. The limitations of the three RF-based systems are also provided. The survey briefly discusses non-RF systems for DCT-U and their limitations. Future directions based on the lessons learned are provided at the end of the survey.</description>

      <title>How Should One Fit Channel Measurements to Fading Distributions for Performance Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel modeling plays a pivotal role in optimizing communication systems, and fitting field measurements to stochastic models is crucial for capturing the key propagation features and to map these to achievable system performances. In this work, we shed light onto what's the most appropriate alternative for channel fitting, when the ultimate goal is performance analysis. Results show that likelihood-based and average-error metrics should be used with caution, since they can largely fail to predict outage probability measures. We show that supremum-error fitting metrics with tail awareness are more robust to estimate both ergodic and outage performance measures, even when they yield a larger average-error fitting.</description>

      <title>The Expected Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of White Gaussian Noise in Sampled I/Q Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental endeavors in radio frequency (RF) metrology is to measure the power of signals, where a common aim is to estimate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which quantifies the ratio of the maximum (peak) to the mean value. For a finite number of discrete-time samples of baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) white Gaussian noise (WGN) that are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, we derive a closed-form, exact formula for mean PAPR that is well-approximated by the natural logarithm of the number of samples plus Euler's constant. Additionally, we give related theoretical results for the mean crest factor (CF). After comparing our main result to previously published approximate formulas, we examine how violations of the WGN assumptions in sampled I/Q data result in deviations from the expected value of PAPR. Finally, utilizing a measured RF I/Q acquisition, we illustrate how our formula for mean PAPR can be applied to spectral analysis with spectrograms to verify when measured RF emissions are WGN in a given frequency band.</description>

      <title>OTFS-ISAC System with Sub-Nyquist ADC Sampling Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless communication and radar systems, enabling high-resolution sensing and high-throughput communication with shared spectrum and hardware. However, achieving a fine radar resolution often requires high-rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and substantial storage, making it both expensive and impractical for many commercial applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based ISAC architecture that operates at reduced ADC sampling rates, yet preserves accurate radar estimation and supports simultaneous communication. The proposed architecture introduces pilot symbols directly in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain to leverage the transformation mapping between the DD and time-frequency (TF) domains to keep selected subcarriers active while others are inactive, allowing the radar receiver to exploit under-sampling aliasing and recover the original DD signal at much lower sampling rates. To further enhance the radar accuracy, we develop an iterative interference estimation and cancellation algorithm that mitigates data symbol interference. We propose a code-based spreading technique that distributes data across the DD domain to preserve the maximum unambiguous radar sensing range. For communication, we implement a complete transceiver pipeline optimized for reduced sampling rate system, including synchronization, channel estimation, and iterative data detection. Experimental results from a software-defined radio (SDR)-based testbed confirm that our method substantially lowers the required sampling rate without sacrificing radar sensing performance and ensures reliable communication.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Finite Constellations, Receiver Design, and SIC-free Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.</description>

      <title>Flag Sequence Set Design for Low-Complexity Delay-Doppler Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Flag sequences for low-complexity delay-Doppler estimation by exploiting their distinctive peak-curtain ambiguity functions (AFs). Unlike the existing Flag sequence designs that are limited to prime lengths and periodic auto-AFs, we aim to design Flag sequence sets of arbitrary lengths with low (nontrivial) periodic/aperiodic auto- and cross-AFs. Since every Flag sequence consists of a Curtain sequence and a Peak sequence, we first investigate the algebraic design of Curtain sequence sets of arbitrary lengths. Our proposed design gives rise to novel Curtain sequence sets with ideal curtain auto-AFs and zero/near-zero cross-AFs within the delay-Doppler zone of operation. Leveraging these Curtain sequence sets, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the weighted integrated masked sidelobe level (WImSL) of the Flag sequence set. Accelerated parallel partially majorization-minimization algorithms are proposed to jointly optimize the transmit Flag sequences and symmetric/asymmetric reference sequences stored in the receiver. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed Flag sequences lead to improved WImSL and peak-to-max-masked-sidelobe ratio compared with the existing Flag sequences. Additionally, our Flag sequences under the Flag method exhibit Mean Squared Errors that approach the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and the sampling bound at high signal-to-noise power ratios.</description>

      <title>Channel Orthogonalization with Reconfigurable Surfaces: General Models, Theoretical Limits, and Effective Configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We envision a future in which multi-antenna technology effectively exploits the spatial domain as a set of non-interfering orthogonal resources, allowing for flexible resource allocation and efficient modulation/demodulation. We may refer to this paradigm as orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM). On the other hand, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology which allows shaping the propagation environment for improved performance. This paper studies the ability of three extended types of reconfigurable surface (RS), including the recently proposed beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), to achieve perfectly orthogonal channels in a general multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario. We consider practical implementations for the three types of RS consisting of passive components, and obtain the corresponding restrictions on their reconfigurability. We then use these restrictions to derive closed-form conditions and explicit expressions for achieving arbitrary (orthogonal) channels. We also study the problem of exploiting the degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the channel orthogonality constraint to maximize the channel gain while maintaining the passive RS constraints, and we propose some initial methods with satisfying performance. Finally, we provide some channel estimation and RS configuration techniques within this framework, where the computations are assumed to be performed at the BS, and we derive some limits on the amount of overhead required to achieve channel orthogonalization with RSs. The numerical results confirm the theoretical findings, showing that channel orthogonality with passive RSs can be effectively achieved in practical environments as long as the direct channel is not significant with respect to the RS cascaded channel. We thus take some important steps towards realizing OSDM.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enabled Multi-Task Physical Layer Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Particularly, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization of AI in different physical-layer (PHY) tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse PHY tasks requires extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task PHY network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM, by exploiting the excellent semantic understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish different tasks. The proposed design allows different wireless data types to be well aligned with the LLM input format. Moreover, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is utilized for LLM fine-tuning. To reduce the memory requirement during LLM fine-tuning, a LoRA fine-tuning-aware quantization method is introduced. Extensive numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Variable-Rate CSI Reconstruction for FDD Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, acquiring channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) traditionally relies on limited feedback from mobile terminals (MTs). However, the accuracy of channel reconstruction from feedback CSI is inherently constrained by the rate-distortion trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-modal channel reconstruction framework that leverages auxiliary data, such as RGB images or uplink CSI, collected at the BS. By integrating contextual information from these modalities, the framework mitigates CSI distortions caused by noise, compression, and quantization. At its core, the framework utilizes an autoencoder network capable of generating variable-length CSI, tailored for rate-adaptive multi-modal channel reconstruction. By augmenting the foundational autoencoder network using a transfer learning-based multi-modal fusion strategy, we enable accurate channel reconstruction in both single-modal and multi-modal scenarios. To train and evaluate the network under diverse and realistic wireless conditions, we construct a synthetic dataset that pairs wireless channel data with sensor data through 3D modeling and ray tracing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in 5G New Radio (5G NR)-compliant scenarios, highlighting the potential of sensor data integration to improve CSI reconstruction accuracy.</description>
