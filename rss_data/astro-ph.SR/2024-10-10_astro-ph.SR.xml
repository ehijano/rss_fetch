      <title>Estimates of (convective core) masses, radii, and relative ages for $\sim$14,000 Gaia-discovered gravity-mode pulsators monitored by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravito-inertial asteroseismology saw its birth from the 4-years long light curves of rotating main-sequence stars assembled by the Kepler space telescope. High-precision measurements of internal rotation and mixing are available for about 600 stars of intermediate mass so far that are used to challenge the state-of-the-art stellar structure and evolution models. Our aim is to prepare for future large ensemble modelling of gravity (g)-mode pulsators by relying on a new sample of such stars recently discovered from the third Data Release of the Gaia space mission and confirmed by space photometry from the TESS mission. This sample of potential asteroseismic targets is about 23 times larger than the Kepler sample. We use the effective temperature and luminosity inferred from Gaia to deduce evolutionary masses, convective core masses, radii, and ages for ~14,000 g-mode pulsators classified as such from their nominal TESS light curves. We do so by constructing two dedicated grids of evolutionary models for rotating stars with input physics from the asteroseismic calibrations of Kepler $\gamma$ Dor pulsators. We find the new g-mode pulsators to cover an extended observational instability region covering masses from about 1.3 to 9Msun. We provide their mass-luminosity and mass-radius relations, as well as convective core masses. Our results suggest that oscillations excited by the opacity mechanism occur uninterruptedly for the mass range above about 2Msun, where stars have a radiative envelope aside from thin convection zones in their excitation layers. Our evolutionary parameters for the sample of Gaia-discovered g-mode pulsators with confirmed modes by TESS offer a fruitful starting point for future TESS ensemble asteroseismology once a sufficient number of modes is identified in terms of the geometrical wave numbers and overtone for each of the pulsators.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI detection of [Ne V], [Ne VI], and [O IV] wind emission in the O9V star 10 Lacertae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05469v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of broad, flat-topped emission in the fine-structure lines of [Ne V], [Ne VI], and [O IV] in mid-infrared spectra of the O9 V star 10 Lacertae obtained with JWST/MIRI. Optically thin emission in these high ions traces a hot, low-density component of the wind. The observed line fluxes imply a mass-loss rate of 2-4 x 10^8 Msun/yr, which is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates based on UV and optical diagnostics. The presence of this hot component reconciles measured values of the mass-loss rate with theoretical predictions, and appears to solve the "weak wind" problem for the particular case of 10 Lac.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Campaign Observations of a Young Solar-type Star, EK Draconis. II. Understanding Prominence Eruption through Data-Driven Modeling and Observed Magnetic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EK Draconis, a nearby young solar-type star (G1.5V, 50-120 Myr), is known as one of the best proxies for inferring the environmental conditions of the young Sun. The star frequently produces superflares and Paper I presented the first evidence of an associated gigantic prominence eruption observed as a blueshifted H$\alpha$ Balmer line emission. In this paper, we present the results of dynamical modeling of the stellar eruption and examine its relationship to the surface starspots and large-scale magnetic fields observed concurrently with the event. By performing a one-dimensional free-fall dynamical model and a one dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the flow along the expanding magnetic loop, we found that the prominence eruption likely occurred near the stellar limb (12$^{+5}_{-5}$-16$^{+7}_{-7}$ degrees from the limb) and was ejected at an angle of 15$^{+6}_{-5}$-24$^{+6}_{-6}$ degrees relative to the line of sight, and the magnetic structures can expand into a coronal mass ejection (CME). The observed prominence displayed a terminal velocity of $\sim$0 km s$^{-1}$ prior to disappearance, complicating the interpretation of its dynamics in Paper I. The models in this paper suggest that prominence's H$\alpha$ intensity diminishes at around or before its expected maximum height, explaining the puzzling time evolution in observations. The TESS light curve modeling and (Zeeman) Doppler Imaging revealed large mid-latitude spots with polarity inversion lines and one polar spot with dominant single polarity, all near the stellar limb during the eruption. This suggests that mid-latitude spots could be the source of the pre-existing gigantic prominence we reported in Paper I. These results provide valuable insights into the dynamic processes that likely influenced the environments of early Earth, Mars, Venus, and young exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Comparison between the emission torus and the measured toroidal magnetic field for the Crab and Vela nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization measurements provide insight into the magnetic field, a critical aspect of the dynamics and emission properties around the compact object. In this paper, we present the polarized magnetic field of the Crab outer torus and the Vela arc utilizing Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observation data. The polarization angle (PA) measured for the Crab outer torus exhibits two monotonic evolutions along the azimuth angle, which are consistent with the normal line of the elliptical ring. There is a slight increase in PA along the azimuth angle for both the inner arc and the outer arc of the Vela nebula. The polarized magnetic vector along the outer torus of the Crab nebula shows the polarized magnetic field aligns with Crab outer torus structure. The PA variation along the Crab outer torus suggests a bulk flow speed of 0.8c. Meanwhile, the Vela nebula polarized magnetic field does not exactly align with the Vela arc structure. We noted that the Crab nebula possesses a polarized toroidal magnetic field, where as the Vela nebula exhibits an incomplete toroidal magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies II: Fully Analytical EEDM Equations and Pseudo-Advective Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical insight into plasma evolution in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit can be revealed by decomposing the evolution according to the characteristic modes of the system. In this paper we explore aspects of the eigenenergy decomposition method (EEDM) introduced in an earlier study (Raboonik et al. 2024 , ApJ, 967:80). The EEDM provides an exact decomposition of nonlinear MHD disturbances into their component eigenenergies associated with the slow, Alfv\'en, and fast eigenmodes, together with two zero-frequency eigenmodes. Here we refine the EEDM by presenting globally analytical expressions for the eigenenergies. We also explore the nature of the zero-frequency ``pseudo-advective modes'' in detail. We show that in evolutions with pure advection of magnetic and thermal energy (without propagating waves) a part of the energy is carried by the pseudo advective modes. Exact expressions for the error terms associated with these modes--commonly encountered in numerical simulations--are also introduced. The new EEDM equations provide a robust tool for the exact and unique decomposition of nonlinear disturbances governed by homogeneous quasi-linear partial differential equations, even in the presence of local or global degeneracies.</description>

      <title>A Natural Laboratory for Astrochemistry, a Variable Protostar B335</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission lines from complex organic molecules in B335 were observed in four epochs, spanning a luminosity burst of about 10 years duration. The emission lines increased dramatically in intensity as the luminosity increased, but they have decreased only slightly as the luminosity has decreased. This behavior agrees with expectations of rapid sublimation as the dust temperature increases, but slower freeze-out after the dust temperature drops. Further monitoring of this source, along with detailed chemical models, will exploit this natural laboratory for astrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Collisional and Radiative Data for Tellurium ions in Kilonovae modelling and Laboratory Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tellurium is a primary candidate for the identification of the 2.1 $\mu$m emission line in kilonovae (KNe) spectra AT2017gfo and GRB230307A. Despite this, there is currently an insufficient amount of atomic data available for this species. We calculate the required atomic structure and collisional data, particularly the data required for accurate Non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (NLTE) modelling of the low temperatures and densities in KNe. We use a Multi-Configurational-Dirac-Hartree-Fock method to produce optimised one-electron orbitals for Te {\sc i}-{\sc iii}.
  As a result energy levels and Einstein A-coefficients for Te {\sc i}-{\sc iii} have been calculated. These orbitals are then employed within Dirac $R$-matrix collision calculations to provide electron-impact-excitation collision strengths that were subsequently averaged according to a thermal Maxwellian distribution. Subsequent \textsc{tardis} simulations using this new atomic data reveal no significant changes to the synthetic spectra due to the very minor contribution of Te at early epochs. NLTE simulations with the ColRadPy package reveal optically thin spectra consistent with the increasing prominence of the Te {\sc iii} 2.1 $\mu$m line as the KNe ejecta cools. This is reinforced by the estimation of luminosities at nebular KNe conditions. New line ratios for both observation and laboratory benchmarks of the atomic data are proposed.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the JAGB method for the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way from Gaia DR3, considering the role of oxygen-rich AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JAGB method is a new way of measuring distances with use of AGB stars that are situated in a selected region in a J versus J-Ks CMD, using the fact that the absolute J magnitude is (nearly) constant. It is implicitly assumed in the method that the selected stars are carbon-rich AGB stars. However, as the sample selected to determine M_J is purely colour based there can also be contamination by oxygen-rich AGB stars. As the ratio of C to O-rich stars is known to depend on metallicity and initial mass, the star formation history and age-metallicity relation in a galaxy should influence the value of M_J.
  The aim of this paper is to look at mixed samples of O- and C-rich stars for the LMC, the SMC and Milky Way (MW), using the Gaia catalogue of long period variables as basis. We report the mean and median magnitudes and the results of fitting Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles to the luminosity function (LF) using different colour and magnitudes cuts.
  For the SMC and LMC we confirm the previous results in the literature. The LFs of the SMC and LMC JAGB stars are clearly different, yet the mean magnitude inside a selection box can be argued to agree at the 0.02~mag level.
  The analysis of the MW sample is less straightforward. The contamination by O-rich stars is substantial for a classical lower limit of (J-Ks)0= 1.3, and becomes less than 10% only for (J-Ks)0= 1.5.
  The sample of AGB stars is much smaller than for the MCs for two reasons. Nearby AGB stars tend to be absent as they saturate in the 2MASS catalogue, and the parallax errors of AGB stars tend to be larger compared to non-AGB stars. The mean and median magnitudes are fainter than for the MC samples by about 0.4~mag which is not predicted by theory. We do not confirm the claim in the literature that the absolute calibration of the JAGB method is independent of metallicity up to solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>Characterising the stellar differential rotation based on largest-spot statistics from ground-based photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar spot distribution has consequences on the observable periodic signals in long-time baseline ground-based photometry. We model the statistics of the dominating spots of two young and active Solar-type stars, V889 Her and LQ Hya, in order to obtain information on the underlying spot distribution, rotation of the star, as well as the orientation of the stellar axis of spin.
  By calculating estimates for spot-induced periodicities in independent subsets of photometric data, we obtain statistics based on the dominating spots in each subset, giving rise to largest-spot statistics accounting for stellar geometry and rotation, including differential rotation.
  Our simple statistical models are able to reproduce the observed distribution of photometric signals rather well. This also enables us to estimate the dependence of angular velocity of the spots as a function of latitude. Our results indicate that V889 Her has a non-monotonic differential rotation curve with a maximum angular velocity between latitudes of 37-40 deg and lower angular velocity at the pole than the equator. Our results for LQ Hya indicate that the star rotates much like a rigid body. Furthermore, the results imply that the monotonic Solar differential rotation curve may not be a universal model for other solar-type stars.
  The non-monotonicity of the differential rotation of V889 Her is commonly produced in magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which indicates that our results are realistic from a theoretical perspective.</description>

      <title>No Maunder Minimum phase in HD 4915</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term solar magnetic activity and its cyclical behaviour, which is maintained by a dynamo mechanism, are both still challenging for the astrophysics. In particular, an atypical event occurred between 1645 and 1715 when the solar activity was remarkably decreased and the number of sunspots got extremely reduced. However, it is still unclear what happened to the solar cycle. The discovery of longer activity minima in cool stars may shed light on the nature of the complex mechanisms involved in the long-term behaviour of the solar-stellar dynamo. Our aim is to explore if the G5V solar-like star HD 4915, which showed a striking chromospheric activity pattern in a previous study performed with HIRES data, could be considered a bona fide Maunder Minimum (hereafter MM) candidate. We have analyzed over 380 spectra acquired between 2003 and 2022 using HARPS and HIRES spectrographs. We carried out a detailed search of activity signatures in HD 4915 by using the Mount Wilson and the Balmer H$_{\alpha}$ activity indexes. This task was performed by means of the GLS periodogram. The new HARPS data show that the chromospheric activity of HD 4915 is not decreasing. In fact, the rise of the activity after the broad minimum in three years gets to the level of activity before that phase, suggesting that it is not entering into a MM phase. HD 4915 shows a distinctive activity behaviour initially attributed to a possible and incipient MM phase. The additional HARPS data allow us to discard a MM in the star. Our analysis shows that the complex activity pattern of HD 4915 could be ruled by a multiple activity cycle, being a shorter cycle of 4.8-yr modulated by a potential longer one. More activity surveys with extensive records and suitable cadence are crucial for accurate identification of stars in Magnetic Grand Minima.</description>

      <title>Ages of Stars and Planets in the Kepler Field Younger Than Four Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of FGK stars in open clusters have helped clarify the precision with which a star's rotation rate and lithium content can be used as empirical indicators for its age. Here we apply this knowledge to stars observed by Kepler. Rotation periods are drawn from previous work; lithium is measured from new and archival Keck/HIRES spectra. We report rotation-based ages for 23,813 stars (harboring 795 known planets) for which our method is applicable. We find that our rotational ages recover the ages of stars in open clusters spanning 0.04-2.5 Gyr; they also agree with over 90% of the independent lithium ages. The resulting yield includes 63 planets younger than 1 Gyr at 2$\sigma$, and 109 with median ages below 1 Gyr. This is about half the number expected under the classic assumption of a uniform star formation history. The age distribution that we observe, rather than being uniform, shows that the youngest stars in the Kepler field are 3-5 times rarer than stars 3 Gyr old. This trend holds for both known planet hosts and for the parent stellar sample. We attribute this "demographic cliff" to a combination of kinematic heating and a declining star formation rate in the Galaxy's thin disk, and highlight its impact on the age distribution of known transiting exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Most extremely low mass white dwarfs with non-degenerate companions are inner binaries of hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely-low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs) with non-degenerate companions are believed to originate from solar-type main-sequence binaries undergoing stable Roche lobe overflow mass transfer when the ELM WD progenitor is at (or just past) the termination of the main-sequence. This implies that the orbital period of the binary at the onset of the first mass transfer phase must have been $\lesssim 3-5$ d. This prediction in turn suggests that most of these binaries should have tertiary companions since $\approx 90$ per cent of solar-type main-sequence binaries in that period range are inner binaries of hierarchical triples. Until recently, only precursors of this type of binaries have been observed in the form of EL CVn binaries, which are also known for having tertiary companions. Here, we present high-angular-resolution images of TYC 6992-827-1, an ELM WD with a sub-giant (SG) companion, confirming the presence of a tertiary companion. Furthermore, we show that TYC 6992-827-1, along with its sibling TYC 8394-1331-1 (whose triple companion was detected via radial velocity variations), are in fact descendants of EL CVn binaries. Both TYC 6992-827-1 and TYC 8394-1331-1 will evolve through a common envelope phase, which depending on the ejection efficiency of the envelope, might lead to a single WD or a tight double WD binary, which would likely merge into a WD within a few Gyr due to gravitational wave emission. The former triple configuration will be reduced to a wide binary composed of a WD (the merger product) and the current tertiary companion.</description>

      <title>Two waves of massive stars running away from the young cluster R136</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are predominantly born in stellar associations or clusters. Their radiation fields, stellar winds, and supernovae strongly impact their local environment. In the first few million years of a cluster's life, massive stars are dynamically ejected running away from the cluster at high speed. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Astrometric analysis with Gaia reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We find that 23-33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic medium, along with their role in driving galactic outflows, is far more important than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Remnant Planetary Systems as a Function of Main-Sequence Mass with HST/COS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the descendants of stars with masses less than 8 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence, white dwarfs provide a unique way to constrain planetary occurrence around intermediate-mass stars (spectral types BAF) that are otherwise difficult to measure with radial-velocity or transit surveys. We update the analysis of more than 250 ultraviolet spectra of hot ($13{,}000$ K $&lt; T_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt;$ $30{,}000$ K), young (less than $800$ Myr) white dwarfs collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, which reveals that more than 40% of all white dwarfs show photospheric silicon and sometimes carbon, signpost for the presence of remnant planetary systems. However, the fraction of white dwarfs with metals significantly decreases for massive white dwarfs (M$_{\rm WD}~&gt;$ 0.8 M$_{\odot}$), descendants of stars with masses greater than 3.5 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence, as just $11^{+6}_{-4}$% exhibit metal pollution. In contrast, $44\pm6$% of a subset of white dwarfs (M$\rm _{WD}~&lt;$ 0.7 M$_{\odot}$) unbiased by the effects of radiative levitation are actively accreting planetary debris. While the population of massive white dwarfs is expected to be influenced by the outcome of binary evolution, we do not find merger remnants to broadly affect our sample. We connect our measured occurrence rates of metal pollution on massive white dwarfs to empirical constraints into planetary formation and survival around stars with masses greater than 3.5 M$_{\odot}$ on the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Systematic 2.5 D resistive MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and Hall effect for fast magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion as a mechanism for fast reconnection. The reconnected flux of our resistive and resistive+Hall simulations replicates the GEM results. Furthermore, we investigate, for the first time, the effect of ambipolar diffusion in the GEM. The reconnected flux of the resistive+ambipolar and resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulations showed increases of up to 75\% and 143\%, respectively, compared to the resistive and resistive+Hall simulations, showing that ambipolar diffusion contributes significantly to the reconnected flux. Our second scenario has a magnetic Harris field without perturbations but with an out-of-plane component, known as a guide field. We found that the reconnection rate increased faster with ambipolar diffusion, reaching values close to 0.1 for the resistive+Hall+ambipolar simulation followed by the resistive+Hall. These two simulations achieved the highest kinetic energy, implying more efficient energy conversion during reconnection.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Insights Into Luminous Blue Variables and B[e] Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work suggests that many luminous blue variables (LBVs) and B[e] supergiants (sgB[e]) are isolated, implying that they may be products of massive binaries, kicked by partner supernovae (SNe). However, the evidence is somewhat complex and controversial. To test this scenario, we measure the proper-motion velocities for these objects in the LMC and SMC, using Gaia Data Release 3. Our LMC results show that the kinematics, luminosities, and IR properties point to LBVs and sgB[e] stars being distinct classes. We find that Class 1 LBVs, which have dusty nebulae, and sgB[e] stars both show velocity distributions comparable to that of SMC field OBe stars, which are known to have experienced SN kicks. The sgB[e] stars are faster, plausibly due to their lower average masses. However, Class 2 LBVs, which are luminous objects without dusty nebulae, show no signs of acceleration, therefore suggesting that they are single stars, pre-SN binaries, or perhaps binary mergers. The candidate LBV Class 3 stars, which are dominated by hot dust, are all confirmed sgB[e] stars; their luminosities and velocities show that they simply represent the most luminous and massive of the sgB[e] class. There are very few SMC objects, but the sgB[e] stars are faster than their LMC counterparts, which may be consistent with expectations that lower-metallicity binaries are tighter, causing faster ejections. We also examine the distinct class of dust-free, weak-lined sgB[e] stars, finding that the SMC objects have the fastest velocities of the entire sample.</description>

      <title>Detection of the solar internal flows with numerical simulation and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar interior is filled with turbulent thermal convection, which plays a key role in the energy and momentum transport and the generation of the magnetic field. The turbulent flows in the solar interior cannot be optically detected due to its significant optical depth. Currently, helioseismology is the only way to detect the internal dynamics of the Sun. However, long-duration data with a high cadence is required and only the temporal average can be inferred. To address these issues effectively, in this study, we develop a novel method to infer the solar internal flows using a combination of radiation magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations and machine/deep learning. With the application of our new method, we can evaluate the large-scale flow at 10 Mm depth from the solar surface with three snapshots separated by an hour. We also apply it to the observational data. Our method is highly consistent with the helioseismology, whereas the amount of input data is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>JWST-IPA: Chemical Inventory and Spatial Mapping of Ices in the Protostar HOPS370 -- Evidence for an Opacity Hole and Thermal Processing of Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of protoplanetary disks, and hence the initial conditions of planet formation, may be strongly influenced by the infall and thermal processing of material during the protostellar phase. Composition of dust and ice in protostellar envelopes, shaped by energetic processes driven by the protostar, serves as the fundamental building material for planets and complex organic molecules. As part of the JWST GO program, "Investigating Protostellar Accretion" (IPA), we observed an intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370 (OMC2-FIR3) using NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS. This study presents the gas and ice phase chemical inventory revealed with the JWST in the spectral range of $\sim$2.9 to 28 $\mu$m and explores the spatial variation of volatile ice species in the protostellar envelope. We find evidence for thermal processing of ice species throughout the inner envelope. We present the first high-spatial resolution ($\sim 80$ au) maps of key volatile ice species H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, and OCN$^-$, which reveal a highly structured and inhomogeneous density distribution of the protostellar envelope, with a deficiency of ice column density that coincides with the jet/outflow shocked knots. Further, we observe high relative crystallinity of H$_{2}$O ice around the shocked knot seen in the H$_2$ and OH wind/outflow, which can be explained by a lack of outer colder material in the envelope along the line of sight due to the irregular structure of the envelope. These observations show clear evidence of thermal processing of the ices in the inner envelope, close to the outflow cavity walls, heated by the luminous protostar.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stellar Metallicity: A Comparative Analysis of Regression Models for Solar Twin Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research focuses on determining the metallicity ([Fe/H]) predicted in the solar twin stars by using various regression modeling techniques which are, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector, and Gradient Boosting. The data set that is taken into account here includes Stellar parameters and chemical abundances derived from a high-accuracy abundance catalog of solar twins from the GALAH survey. To overcome the missing values, intensive preprocessing techniques involving, imputation are done. Each model will subjected to training using different critical observables, which include, Mean Squared Error(MSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE), and R-squared. Modeling is done by using, different feature sets like temperature: effective temperature(Teff), surface gravity: log g of 14-chemical-abundances namely, (([Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Sc/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Cr/Fe], [Mn/Fe], [Ni/Fe], [Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], [Y/Fe], [Ba/Fe])).
  The target variable considered is the metallicity ([Fe/H]). The findings indicate that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, with an MSE of 0.001628 and an R-squared value of 0.9266. The results highlight the efficacy of ensemble methods in handling complex datasets with high dimensionality. Additionally, this study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate regression models for astronomical data analysis, providing a foundation for future research in predicting stellar properties with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>A network of cooler white dwarfs as infrared standards for flux calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>

      <title>Discovery of eclipses in the cataclysmic variable LAMOST J035913.61+405035.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I conducted photometric observations of the cataclysmic variable LAMOST J035913.61+405035.0 and discovered previously unknown eclipses. During these observations, I recorded 14 eclipses over two groups of nights separated by 13 months. I accurately determined the orbital period of the system to be Porb=0.22834385+\-0.00000021 d. For the eclipses, I derived an ephemeris which is valid for a long time and suitable for studying changes in the orbital period. The out-of-eclipse magnitude of the star varied between 15.32(+\-0.02) and 17.25(+\-0.08) mag. As the brightness decreased, the eclipses became deeper and narrower. The average depth of eclipses was 1.35(+\-0.10) mag, and the average width at half-depth was 16.9(+\-0.7) min. I estimated the range of possible orbital inclinations to be between 72.8 degr and 76.0 degr, and the range of average absolute V-band magnitudes of the disc to be between 5.16(+\-0.15) and 5.44(+\-0.15) mag. Although based on the light curve from the ZTF survey, LAMOST J035913.61+405035.0 showed only small outbursts with amplitudes below 1.5 mag, it should be classified as a dwarf nova because the average disc brightness and mass transfer rate were below the limit of thermal instability. However, there have been no significant outbursts in the ZTF light curve over the past 1.6 yr. Instead, a gradual decrease in brightness lasting 120 d suggests that this object may occasionally become a nova-like variable of the VY Scl type.</description>

      <title>Local stability of differential rotation in magnetised radiation zones and the solar tachocline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) instabilities of differential rotation in magnetised, stably-stratified regions of stars and planets using a Cartesian Boussinesq model. We consider arbitrary latitudes and general shears (with gravity direction misaligned from this by an angle $\phi$), to model radial ($\phi=0$), latitudinal ($\phi=\pm 90^\circ$), and mixed differential rotations, and study both non-diffusive (including magnetorotational, MRI, and Solberg-H{\o}iland instabilities) and diffusive instabilities (including Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke, GSF, and MRI with diffusion). These instabilities could drive turbulent transport and mixing in radiative regions, including the solar tachocline and the cores of red giant stars, but their dynamics are incompletely understood. We revisit linear axisymmetric instabilities with and without diffusion and analyse their properties in the presence of magnetic fields, including deriving stability criteria and computing growth rates, wavevectors and energetics, both analytically and numerically. We present a more comprehensive analysis of axisymmetric local instabilities than prior work, exploring arbitrary differential rotations and diffusive processes. The presence of a magnetic field leads to stability criteria depending upon angular velocity rather than angular momentum gradients. We find MRI operates for much weaker differential rotations than the hydrodynamic GSF instability, and that it typically prefers much larger lengthscales, while the GSF instability is impeded by realistic strength magnetic fields. We anticipate MRI to be more important for turbulent transport in the solar tachocline than the GSF instability when $\phi&gt;0$ in the northern (and vice versa in the southern) hemisphere, though the latter could operate just below the convection zone when MRI is absent for $\phi&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>KM UMa: An active short-period detached eclipsing binary in a hierarchical quadruple system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the G-type eclipsing binary KM UMa is presented, which indicates that the system is a short-period detached eclipsing binary. The radial velocity curves were calculated using the cross-correlation function method based on Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and our observations, which determined the mass ratio as $q=0.45\ (\pm0.04)$. Based on the light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, other survey data, and our multiband observations, the positive and negative O'Connell effects have been detected evolving gradually and alternately over the last 20 yr, which can be explained by the presence of spots on the primary component. A superflare event was detected in the SuperWASP data on 2007 February 28, further indicating that KM UMa is a very active system. We calculated its energy to be $5\times10^{34}$ erg by assuming it occurred on the primary star. Utilizing hundreds of medium-resolution spectra and one low-resolution spectrum, the equivalent width variations of the $H_{\alpha}$ line were calculated, indicating the presence of a 5.21 ($\pm0.67$) yr magnetic activity cycle. The orbital period variations were analyzed using the O-C method, detecting a long-term decrease superimposed with a periodic variation. The amplitude of the cyclic variation is $0.01124\ (\pm0.00004)$ day, with a period of $33.66\ (\pm 0.0012)$ yr, which exceeds the 5.21 yr activity cycle, suggesting that this is more likely attributable to the light travel time effect of a third body. Simultaneously, a visual companion has been detected based on the Gaia astrometric data, indicating that KM UMa is actually in a 2+1+1 hierarchical quadruple system.</description>

      <title>Probing the Extended Atmospheres of AGB Stars: I. Synthetic imaging of 1D hydrodynamical models at radio and (sub-)millimeter wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observable characteristics of the extended atmospheres of AGB stars across a wide range of radio and (sub-)mm wavelengths using state-of-the-art 1D dynamical atmosphere and wind models over one pulsation period. We also study the relationships between the observable features and model properties. We further study practical distance ranges for observable sources assuming the capabilities of current and upcoming observatories. We present time-variable, frequency-dependent profiles of pulsating AGB stars' atmospheres, illustrating observable features in resolved and unresolved observations, including disc brightness temperature, photosphere radius, and resolved and unresolved spectral indices. Notably, temporal variations in disc brightness temperature closely mirror the temperature variability of the stellar atmosphere. We find that while the photospheric radius decreases due to gas dilution in the layers between consecutive shocks, the increase in the observed stellar radius reflects shock propagation through the atmosphere during the expansion phase, providing a direct measurement method for the shock velocity. Furthermore, our models indicate that enhanced gas temperatures after the passage of a strong shock might be observable in the high-frequency ALMA bands as a decrease in the brightness temperature with increasing frequency. We demonstrate that synthetic observations based on state-of-the-art dynamical atmosphere and wind models are necessary for proper interpretations of current (ALMA and VLA) and future (SKA and ngVLA) observations and that multi-wavelength observations of AGB stars are crucial for empirical studies of their extended atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Chemical composition of planetary hosts: C, N, and $\alpha$-element abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of planet-hosting stars are crucial for characterising exoplanets and understanding their formation and evolution. Our objective is to uniformly determine the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and the $\alpha$-elements, magnesium and silicon, along with C/O, N/O and Mg/Si abundance ratios in planet-hosts. We aim to investigate the potential links between stellar chemistry and the presence of planets using high-resolution spectra of 149 F, G, and K dwarf and giant stars hosting planets or planetary systems. The spectra were obtained with the Vilnius University Echelle Spectrograph on the 1.65 m Mol\.{e}tai Observatory telescope. Stellar parameters were determined through standard analysis using equivalent widths and one-dimensional, plane-parallel model atmospheres calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium. The differential synthetic spectrum method was used to uniformly determine carbon C(C2), nitrogen N(CN), oxygen [O I], magnesium Mg I, and silicon Si I elemental abundances as well as the C/O, N/O, and Mg/Si ratios. We found that [C/Fe], [O/Fe], and [Mg/Fe] are lower in metal-rich dwarf hosts; whereas [N/Fe] is close to the Solar ratio. Giants show smaller scatter in [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] and lower than the Solar average [C/Fe] and C/O ratios. The (C+N+O) abundances increase with [Fe/H] in giant stars, with a minimal scatter. We also noted an overabundance of Mg and Si in planet hosting stars, particularly at lower metallicities, and a lower Mg/Si ratio in stars with planets. In giants hosting high-mass planets, nitrogen shows a moderate positive relationship with planet mass. C/O and N/O ratios show moderate negative and positive slopes in giant stars, respectively. The Mg/Si ratio shows a negative correlation with planet mass across the entire stellar sample.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Two New Eruptions of the Ultrashort Recurrence Time Nova M31N 2017-01e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the recent discovery of two new eruptions of the recurrent nova M31N 2017-01e in the Andromeda galaxy. The latest eruption, M31N 2024-08c, reached $R=17.8$ on 2024 August 06.85 UT, $\sim2$ months earlier than predicted. In addition to this recent eruption, a search of archival PTF data has revealed a previously unreported eruption on 2014 June 18.46 UT that reached a peak brightness of $R\sim17.9$ approximately a day later. The addition of these two eruption timings has allowed us to update the mean recurrence time of the nova. We find $\langle T_\mathrm{rec} \rangle = 924.0\pm7.0$ days ($2.53\pm0.02$ yr), which is slightly shorter than our previous determination. Thus, M31N 2017-01e remains the nova with the second shortest recurrence time known, with only M31N 2008-12a being shorter. We also present a low-resolution spectrum of the likely quiescent counterpart of the nova, a $\sim20.5$ mag evolved B star displaying an $\sim14.3$ d photometric modulation.</description>

      <title>The Green Monster hiding in front of Cas A: JWST reveals a dense and dusty circumstellar structure pockmarked by ejecta interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations of the young Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A revealed an unexpected structure seen as a green emission feature in colored composite MIRI F1130W and F1280W images - hence dubbed the Green Monster - that stretches across the central parts of the remnant in projection. Combining the kinematic information from NIRSpec and MIRI MRS with the multi-wavelength imaging from NIRCam and MIRI, we associate the Green Monster with circumstellar material that was lost during an asymmetric mass-loss phase. MIRI images are dominated by dust emission but its spectra show emission lines from Ne, H and Fe with low radial velocities indicative of a CSM nature. An X-ray analysis of this feature in a companion paper (Vink et al. 2024) supports its CSM nature and detects significant blue shifting, thereby placing the Green Monster on the near side, in front of the Cas A SN remnant. The most striking features of the Green Monster are dozens of almost perfectly circular 1" - 3" sized holes, most likely created by interaction between high-velocity SN ejecta material and the CSM. Further investigation is needed to understand whether these holes were formed by small 8000-10500 km/s N-rich ejecta knots that penetrated and advanced out ahead of the remnant's 5000 - 6000 km/s outer blastwave, or by narrow ejecta fingers that protrude into the forward-shocked CSM. The detection of the Green Monster provides further evidence of the highly asymmetric mass-loss that Cas A's progenitor star underwent prior to explosion.</description>

      <title>The Polar Vortex Hypothesis: Evolving, Spectrally Distinct Polar Regions Explain Short- and Long-term Light Curve Evolution and Color-Inclination Trends in Brown Dwarfs and Giant Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies revealed viewing-angle-dependent color and spectral trends in brown dwarfs, as well as long-term photometric variability (~100 hr). The origins of these trends are yet unexplained. Here, we propose that these seemingly unrelated sets of observations stem from the same phenomenon: The polar regions of brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets are spectrally different from lower-latitude regions, and that they evolve over longer timescales, possibly driven by polar vortices. We explore this hypothesis via a spatio-temporal atmosphere model capable of simulating time-series, disk-integrated spectra of ultracool atmospheres. We study three scenarios with different spectral and temporal components: A null hypothesis without polar vortex, and two scenarios with polar vortices. We find that the scenarios with polar vortex can explain the observed infrared color-inclination trend and the variability amplitude-inclination trend. The presence of spectrally distinct, time-evolving polar regions in brown dwarfs and giant exoplanet atmospheres raises the possibility that one-dimensional, static atmospheric models may be insufficient for reproducing ultracool atmospheres in detail.</description>

      <title>Gaia-4b and 5b: Radial Velocity Confirmation of Gaia Astrometric Orbital Solutions Reveal a Massive Planet and a Brown Dwarf Orbiting Low-mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia astrometry of nearby stars is precise enough to detect the tiny displacements induced by substellar companions, but radial velocity data are needed for definitive confirmation. Here we present radial velocity follow-up observations of 28 M and K stars with candidate astrometric substellar companions, which led to the confirmation of two systems, Gaia-4b and Gaia-5b, and the refutation of 21 systems as stellar binaries. Gaia-4b is a massive planet ($M = 11.8 \pm 0.7 \:\mathrm{M_J}$) in a $P = 571.3 \pm 1.4\:\mathrm{day}$ orbit with a projected semi-major axis $a_0=0.312 \pm 0.040\:\mathrm{mas}$ orbiting a $0.644 \pm 0.02 \:\mathrm{M_\odot}$ star. Gaia-5b is a brown dwarf ($M = 20.9 \pm 0.5\:\mathrm{M_J}$) in a $P = 358.58 \pm 0.19\:\mathrm{days}$ eccentric $e=0.6412 \pm 0.0027$ orbit with a projected angular semi-major axis of $a_0 = 0.947 \pm 0.038\:\mathrm{mas}$ around a $0.34 \pm 0.03 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ star. Gaia-4b is one of the first exoplanets discovered via the astrometric technique, and is one of the most massive planets known to orbit a low-mass star.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen transport in protoplanetary disks by ammonium salts: a possible origin of Jupiter's nitrogen enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric compositions preserve the history of planet formation processes. Jupiter has the remarkable feature of being uniformly enriched in various elements compared to the Sun, including highly volatile elements such as nitrogen and noble gases. Radial transport of volatile species by amorphous ice in the solar nebula is one mechanism that explains Jupiter's volatile enrichment, but the low entrapment efficiency of nitrogen into amorphous ice is an issue. We propose an alternative mechanism of delivering nitrogen to Jupiter: radial transport of semi-volatile ammonium salts in the solar nebula. Ammonium salts have been identified in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and can potentially compensate for the comet's nitrogen depletion compared to the Sun. We simulate the radial transport and dissociation of ammonium salts carried by dust in a protoplanetary disk, followed by the accretion of the gas and NH$_3$ vapor by a protoplanet, as well as the delivery of nitrogen to the planetary atmosphere from the salt-containing planetary core that undergoes dilution. We find that when the dust contains 10-30 wt% ammonium salts, the production of NH$_3$ vapor in the inner disk (~ 3 au) by dissociated salts and the incorporation of the salt-derived NH$_3$ through core formation and subsequent gas accretion by the protoplanet result in a planetary nitrogen enrichment consistent with the observations of Jupiter. Ammonium salts may thus play a vital role in developing the atmospheric composition of planets forming in the inner disk. Combining our model with future observations of the bulk compositions and isotopes of comets and other primordial bodies will help to further elucidate the elemental transport to the gas giants and ice giants in the solar system.</description>

      <title>On the diversity of strongly-interacting Type IIn supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars experience strong mass-loss, producing a dense, H-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). After the explosion, the collision and continued interaction of the supernova (SN) ejecta with the CSM power the light curve through the conversion of kinetic energy into radiation. When the interaction is strong, the light curve shows a broad peak and high luminosity lasting for a relatively long time. Also the spectral evolution is slower, compared to non-interacting SNe. Energetic shocks between the ejecta and the CSM create the ideal conditions for particle acceleration and production of high-energy (HE) neutrinos above 1 TeV. In this paper, we study four strongly-interacting Type IIn SNe: 2021acya, 2021adxl, 2022qml, and 2022wed to highlight their peculiar characteristics, derive the kinetic energy of the explosion and the characteristics of the CSM, infer clues on the possible progenitors and their environment and relate them to the production of HE neutrinos. The SNe analysed in this sample exploded in dwarf, star-forming galaxies and they are consistent with energetic explosions and strong interaction with the surrounding CSM. For SNe 2021acya and 2022wed, we find high CSM masses and mass-loss rates, linking them to very massive progenitors. For SN 2021adxl, the spectral analysis and less extreme CSM mass suggest a stripped-envelope massive star as possible progenitor. SN 2022qml is marginally consistent with being a Type Ia thermonuclear explosion embedded in a dense CSM. The mass-loss rates for all SNe are consistent with the expulsion of several solar masses of material during eruptive episodes in the last few decades before the explosion. Finally, we find that the SNe in our sample are marginally consistent with HE neutrino production.</description>

      <title>Dust Drift Timescales in Protoplanetary Disks at the Cusp of Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter emitting dust grains have sizes that make them susceptible to drift in protoplanetary disks due to a difference between their orbital speed and that of the gas. The characteristic drift timescale depends on the surface density of the gas. By comparing disk radii measurements from ALMA CO and continuum observations at millimeter wavelengths, the gas surface density profile and dust drift time can be self-consistently determined. We find that profiles which match the measured dust mass have very short drift timescales, an order of magnitude or more shorter than the stellar age, whereas profiles for disks that are on the cusp of gravitational instability, defined via the minimum value of the Toomre parameter, Qmin ~ 1-2, have drift timescales comparable to the stellar lifetime. This holds for disks with masses of dust &gt; 5 MEarth across a range of absolute ages from less than 1 Myr to over 10 Myr. The inferred disk masses scale with stellar mass as Mdisk ~ Mstar / 5Qmin. This interpretation of the gas and dust disk sizes simultaneously solves two long standing issues regarding the dust lifetime and exoplanet mass budget and suggests that we consider millimeter wavelength observations as a window into an underlying population of particles with a wide size distribution in secular evolution with a massive planetesimal disk.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from October 2022 through May 2024 as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Anisotropic Neutron Stars with a Parametrized Equation of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of anisotropy on slowly rotating neutron stars by extending the Hartle-Thorne formalism in general relativity to include anisotropy in pressure up to second order in the angular velocity. We assess the presence of anisotropy within the star by employing a quasi-local relationship. Our results show that the ratio between the gravitational mass of the fastest anisotropic rotating configurations and the corresponding non-rotating ones ranges from $1.12$ to $1.25$, consistent with recent findings. We develop universal relations for the moment of inertia, binding energy, and quadrupole moment of the rotating stars. These relations are tested against various equations of state, which were modeled by a piecewise polytropic function with continuous sound speed.</description>

      <title>On the membership of variable stars in galactic globular clusters: The Oosterhoff gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a critical evaluation of the membership status of all variable stars in globular clusters recorded in the Catalogue of Variable Stars in Globular Clusters (CVSGC) curated by Christine Clement. To this end, we employed the systematic and bulky membership analysis performed by E. Vasiliev and H. Baumgardt based on the proper motions and parallaxes given in Gaia-EDR3. We found numerous variables in the CVSGC which are in fact field stars, which is particularly the case for globular clusters located in the Galactic bulge. Using the newly acquired list of reliable cluster members we examine the Oosterhoff dichotomy present among the Milky Way (MW) globular clusters using their RR Lyrae stars content. We confirm the presence of the Oosterhoff gap, separating both Oosterhoff groups. The Oosterhoff gap is mostly populated by globular clusters associated with MW dwarf galaxies and globular clusters with a low number of fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables. Several of the clusters in the Oosterhoff gap were previously linked to past merger events (e.g. Kraken/Heracles).</description>

      <title>An X-ray Shell Reveals the Supernova Explosion for Galactic Microquasar SS 433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How black holes are formed remains an open and fundamental question in Astrophysics. Despite theoretical predictions, it lacks observations to understand whether the black hole formation experiences a supernova explosion. Here we report the discovery of an X-ray shell north of the Galactic micro-quasar SS 433 harboring a stellar-mass black hole spatially associated with radio continuum and polarization emissions, and an HI cloud. Its spectrum can be reproduced by a 1-keV under-ionized plasma, from which the shell is inferred to have been created by a supernova explosion 20-30 kyr ago and its properties constitute evidence for canonical SN explosions to create some black holes. Our analysis precludes other possible origins including heated by jets or blown by disk winds. According to the lower mass limit of the compact object in SS 433, we roughly deduced that the progenitor should be more massive than 25 M$_{\odot}$. The existence of such a young remnant in SS 433 can also lead to new insights into the supercritical accretion in young microquasars and the ${\gamma}$-ray emission of this system. The fallback ejecta may provide accretion materials within tens of thousands of years while the shock of the supernova remnant may play a crucial role in the cosmic ray (re)acceleration.</description>

      <title>Investigation of 90,92Zr(n,{\gamma}) 91,93Zr in the s process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron capture rates and Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) for 90Zr(n,{\gamma}) 91Zr and 92Zr(n,{\gamma}) 93Zr processes have been computed within the framework of Talys v1.96. The effects of phenomenological nuclear level density (NLD) parameters and the gamma strength functions (GSFs) on Maxwellian averaged cross sections and neutron capture rates are examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The present model based computed data for MACS and reaction rates gives a good comparison with the existing literature. The fine-tuning of the statistical models nuclear properties (level density and gamma-ray strength) to reproduce experimental data will allow the detailed investigation of the s process network.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions of sd shell N=Z nuclei ($^{24}$Mg, $^{28}$Si, and $^{32}$S) are investigated within the framework of proton-neutron quasi particle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) using a deformed basis. The nuclear properties of these special nuclei were investigated by the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model. The RMF framework with density-dependent interactions (DD-PC1 and DD-ME2) was employed to compute ground-state deformation parameters (beta 2) using potential energy curves. The $\beta_2$ values computed from the RMF and the finite range droplet model (FRDM) were employed as a free parameter in the pn QRPA calculation to investigate the resulting GT strength distributions.The present model-based analyses compare well with the observed data.</description>

      <title>A comparative high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of in situ and accreted globular clusters</title>

Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are extremely intriguing systems that help in reconstructing the assembly of the Milky Way via the characterization of their chemo-chrono-dynamical properties. In this study, we use high-resolution spectroscopic archival data from UVES at VLT and UVES-FLAMES at VLT to compare the chemistry of GCs dynamically tagged as either Galactic (NGC 6218, NGC 6522 and NGC 6626) or accreted from distinct merging events (NGC 362 and NGC 1261 from Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, Ruprecht 106 from the Helmi Streams) in the metallicity regime where abundance patterns of field stars with different origin effectively separate ($-1.3 \le$ [Fe/H] $\le -1.0$ dex). We find remarkable similarities in the abundances of the two Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus GCs across all chemical elements. They both display depletion in the $\alpha$-elements (Mg, Si and Ca) and statistically significant differences in Zn and Eu compared to in situ GCs. Additionally, we confirm that Ruprecht 106 exhibits a completely different chemical makeup compared to the other target clusters, being underabundant in all chemical elements. This demonstrates that when high precision is achieved, the abundances of certain chemical elements not only can efficiently separate in situ from accreted GCs, but can also distinguish among GCs born in different progenitor galaxies. In the end, we investigate the possible origin of the chemical peculiarity of Ruprecht 106. Given that its abundances do not match the chemical patterns of field stars associated to its most likely parent galaxy (i.e., the Helmi Streams), especially being depleted in the $\alpha$-elements, we interpret Ruprecht 106 as originating in a less massive galaxy compared to the progenitor of the Helmi Streams.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, as it can employ techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, gradient-based optimization, and other machine learning techniques. This new programming paradigm has motivated us to develop the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022). ExoJAX is designed to directly calculate cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure, rather than interpolating tabulated data, to minimize errors in high-dispersion spectra modeling. However, its application was primarily proof-of-concept and limited to narrowband high-dispersion emission spectroscopy. In this paper, we have enhanced the differentiable opacity calculation using a new fast and memory-efficient algorithm, and have developed differentiable radiative transfer schemes, including emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. These enhancements significantly expand the range of applications, as demonstrated through actual atmospheric retrievals: high-dispersion emission spectra of the brown dwarf GL229 B, medium-dispersion transmission spectra of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b from JWST, and high-dispersion reflection spectra of Jupiter. We obtained a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrained WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular fine structures at original resolution ($R \sim 3,000$), and estimated Jupiter's metallicity consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Moving-mesh non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields have been shown both observationally and through theoretical work to be an important factor in the formation of protostars and their accretion disks. Accurate modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in low-ionization molecular cloud cores requires the inclusion of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) processes, specifically Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect. These have a profound influence on the efficiency of magnetic removal of angular momentum from protostellar disks and simulations that include them can avoid the `magnetic-braking catastrophe' in which disks are not able to form. However, the impact of the Hall effect, in particular, is complex and remains poorly studied. In this work, we perform a large suite of simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars with several non-ideal MHD chemistry models and initial core geometries using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We find that the efficiency of angular momentum removal is significantly reduced with respect to ideal MHD, in line with previous results. The Hall effect has a varied influence on the evolution of the disk which depends on the initial orientation of the magnetic field. This extends to the outflows seen in a subset of the models, where this effect can act to enhance or suppress them and open up new outflow channels. We conclude, in agreement with a subset of the previous literature, that the Hall effect is the dominant non-ideal MHD process in some collapse scenarios and thus should be included in simulations of protostellar disk formation.</description>

      <title>The Energy Sharing Timescale in an Analytic Framework for Common Envelope Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new predictive theory for the analysis of common envelope (CE) events which incorporates the effects of relevant hydrodynamical processes into a simple analytical framework. We introduce the ejection and dynamical parameters $\xi$ and $\beta$, which define if envelope ejection is energetically or hydrodynamically favorable, respectively, during CE inspiral. When combined, these parameters offer a detailed narrative of how inspiral begins, proceeds, and ends that is consistent with preliminary comparisons to 3D hydrodynamical models. This physically-motivated framework impacts predictions for CE outcomes, especially for systems that have energy excess, and offers promise as a potential alternative for the treatment of CE in binary population synthesis.</description>

      <title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semi-analytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of $\sim 10^7$-$10^8~L_\odot$ in optical and UV, and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XII. A new grid of northern standards for the spectral classification of B-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, automated stellar parameter determination has become commonplace. Nevertheless, spectral classification still offers a quick and useful alternative for obtaining parameter estimates for large samples of spectra of varying quality. We present a new atlas of stellar spectra covering the B-type range, with the intention of providing detailed classification criteria valid for modern spectra and improving the grid of reliable standards. This new grid will be used in future works to provide classification criteria beyond the classical classification range and addressing, in particular, the use of Gaia/RVS spectra. We analysed historical standards by means of multiple high-resolution spectra, marking out problematic cases and complementing the grid with a new set of reliable comparators. We then elaborated on a new set of classification criteria based on high-quality R=4000 spectra. Our new classification grid is much thicker than any previous set of standards, presenting a high degree of self-consistency. Although it is based entirely on morphological criteria, the grid demonstrates a much better correlation with different physical parameters. The new grid can be used to study classification criteria in other spectral ranges, providing a valuable tool for the study of B-type stars that covers a very wide range of temperatures, luminosities, and stellar masses. The very process of classification also offers valuable insights into stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Tests of White Dwarf Cooling Physics with Wide Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present follow-up spectroscopy and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of 29 wide double white dwarfs, including eight systems with a crystallized C/O core member. We use state-of-the-art evolutionary models to constrain the physical parameters of each star, including the total age. Assuming that the members of wide binaries are coeval, any age difference between the binary members can be used to test the cooling physics for white dwarf stars, including potential delays due to crystallization and $^{22}$Ne distillation. We use our control sample of 14 wide binaries with non-crystallized members to show that this method works well; the control sample shows an age difference of only $\Delta$Age = $-0.03 \pm$ 0.15 Gyr between its members. For the eight crystallized C/O core systems we find a cooling anomaly of $\Delta$Age= 1.13$^{+1.20}_{-1.07}$ Gyr. Even though our results are consistent with a small additional cooling delay ($\sim1$ Gyr) from $^{22}$Ne distillation and other neutron-rich impurities, the large uncertainties make this result not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we rule out cooling delays longer than 3.6 Gyr at the 99.7% ($3\sigma$) confidence level for 0.6-0.9 $M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. Further progress requires larger samples of wide binaries with crystallized massive white dwarf members. We provide a list of subgiant + white dwarf binaries that could be used for this purpose in the future.</description>

      <title>The $\delta$ Scuti stars of the Cep--Her Complex. I: Pulsator fraction, rotation, asteroseismic large spacings, and the $\nu_{\rm max}$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify delta Scuti pulsators amongst members of the recently-discovered Cep--Her Complex using light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We use Gaia colours and magnitudes to isolate a subsample of provisional Cep--Her members that are located in a narrow band on the colour--magnitude diagram compatible with the zero-age main sequence. The $\delta$ Sct pulsator fraction amongst these stars peaks at 100% and we describe a trend of higher pulsator fractions for younger stellar associations. We use four methods to measure the frequency of maximum amplitude or power, $\nu_{\rm max}$, to minimise methodological bias and we demonstrate their sound performance. The $\nu_{\rm max}$ measurements display a correlation with effective temperature, but with scatter that is too large for the relation to be useful. We find two ridges in the $\nu_{\rm max}$--$T_{\rm eff}$ diagram, one of which appears to be the result of rapid rotation causing stars to pulsate in low-order modes. We measure the $\nu_{\rm max}$ values of $\delta$ Sct stars in four other clusters or associations of similar age (Trumpler 10, the Pleiades, NGC 2516, and Praesepe) and find similar behaviour with $T_{\rm eff}$. Using \'echelle diagrams we measure the asteroseismic large spacing, $\Delta\nu$, for 70 stars, and find a correlation between $\Delta\nu$, rotation, and luminosity that allows rapid rotators seen at low inclinations to be distinguished from slow rotators. We find that rapid rotators are more likely than slow rotators to pulsate, but they do so with less regular pulsation patterns. We also investigate the reliability of Gaia's vbroad measurement for A-type stars, finding that it is mostly accurate but underestimates $v\sin i$ for slow rotators ($v\sin i &lt; 50$ km.s$^{-1}$) by 10--15%.</description>

      <title>The observational evidence that all microflares that accelerate electrons to high energies are rooted in sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, large solar flares are more efficient at accelerating high-energy electrons than microflares. Nonetheless, we sometimes observe microflares that accelerate electrons to high energies. We statistically characterize 39 microflares with strikingly hard spectra in the hard X-ray (HXR) range, which means that they are efficient in accelerating high-energy electrons. We refer to these events as "hard microflares." The statistical analysis is built upon spectral and imaging information from STIX, combined with EUV and magnetic field maps from SDO. The key observational result is that all hard microflares in this dataset have one of the footpoints rooted directly within a sunspot (either in the umbra or the penumbra). This clearly indicates that the underlying magnetic flux densities are large. For the events with the classic two-footpoints morphology, the absolute value of the mean line-of-sight magnetic flux density (and vector magnetic field strength) at the footpoint rooted within the sunspot ranges from 600 to 1800 G (1500 to 2500 G), whereas the outer footpoint measures from 10 to 200 G (100 to 400 G), therefore about 10 times weaker. Approximately 78% of hard microflares, which exhibited two HXR footpoints, have similar or even stronger HXR flux from the footpoint rooted within the sunspot. This contradicts the magnetic mirroring scenario. In addition, about 74% of the events could be approximated by a single loop geometry, demonstrating that hard microflares typically have a relatively simple morphology. We conclude that all hard microflares are rooted in sunspots, which implies that the magnetic field strength plays a key role in efficiently accelerating high-energy electrons, with hard HXR spectra associated with strong fields. This key result will allow us to further constrain our understanding of the electron acceleration mechanisms in flares and space plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields with strengths ranging from 300 to 500 kG have recently been discovered in a group of four extremely similar helium-enriched hot subdwarf (He-sdO) stars. Besides their strong magnetic fields, these He-sdO stars are characterised by common atmospheric parameters, clustering around $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 46500K, $\log g$ close to 6, and intermediate helium abundances. Here we present the discovery of three additional magnetic hot subdwarfs, J123359.44-674929.11, J125611.42-575333.45, and J144405.79-674400.93. These stars are again almost identical in terms of atmospheric parameters but, at $B \approx$ 200kG, their magnetic fields are somewhat weaker than those previously known. The close similarity of all known He-sdOs implies a finely-tuned origin. We propose the merging of an He white dwarf with a H+He white dwarf. A differential rotation at the merge interface may initiate a toroidal magnetic field that evolves by a magnetic dynamo to produce a poloidal field. This field is either directly visible at the surface or may diffuse towards the surface if initially buried. We further discuss a broad absorption line centred at about 4630\r{A} that is common to all magnetic He-sdOs. This feature may not be related to the magnetic field but instead to the intermediate helium abundances in these He-sdO stars, allowing the strong He II 4686\r{A} line to be perturbed by collisions with hydrogen atoms.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of global, resonant oscillation modes in red giant stars offers valuable insights into their internal structures. In this study, we investigate in detail the information we can recover on the structural properties of core-helium burning (CHeB) stars by examining how the coupling between gravity- and pressure-mode cavities depends on several stellar properties, including mass, chemical composition, and evolutionary state. Using the structure of models computed with the stellar evolution code MESA we calculate the coupling coefficient implementing analytical expressions, which are appropriate for the strong coupling regime and the structure of the evanescent region in CHeB stars. Our analysis reveals a notable anti-correlation between the coupling coefficient and both the mass and metallicity of stars in the regime $M \lesssim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, in agreement with Kepler data. We attribute this correlation primarily to variations in the density contrast between the stellar envelope and core. The strongest coupling is expected thus for red-horizontal branch stars, partially stripped stars, and stars in the higher-mass range exhibiting solar-like oscillations ($M \gtrsim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$). While our investigation emphasises some limitations of current analytical expressions, it also presents promising avenues. The frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient emerges as a potential tool for reconstructing the detailed stratification of the evanescent region.</description>

      <title>Photospheric hot spots at solar coronal loop footpoints revealed by hyperspectral imaging observations</title>

Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Connecting stellar and galactic scales: Energetic feedback from stellar wind bubbles to supernova remnants</title>

Abstract: Energy and momentum feedback from stars is a key element of models for galaxy formation and interstellar medium dynamics, but resolving the relevant length scales to directly include this feedback remain out of reach of current-generation simulations. We aim to constrain the energy feedback by winds, photoionisation and supernovae (SNe) from massive stars. We measure the thermal and kinetic energy imparted to the interstellar medium on various length scales, calculated from high-resolution 1D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Our grid of simulations covers a broad range of densities, metallicities, and state-of-the-art evolutionary models of single and binary stars. We find that a single star or binary system can carve a cavity of tens-of-pc size into the surrounding medium. During the pre-SN phase, post-main-sequence stellar winds and photoionisation dominate. While SN explosions dominate the total energy budget, the pre-SN feedback is of great importance by reducing the circumstellar gas density and delaying the onset of radiative losses in the SN remnant. Contrary to expectations, the metallicity dependence of the stellar wind has little effect on the cumulative energy imparted by feedback to the ISM; the only requirement is the existence of a sufficient level of pre-SN radiative and mechanical feedback. The ambient medium density determines how much and when feedback energy reaches to distance $\gtrsim 10-20$ pc and affects the division between kinetic and thermal feedback. Our results can be used as a sub-grid model for feedback in large-scale simulations of galaxies. The results reinforce that the uncertain mapping of stellar evolution sequences to SN explosion energy is very important to determining the overall feedback energy from a stellar population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial, kinematic, and orbital properties, along with ages and chemical compositions of the thin disc, thick disc, and various stellar substructures in the halo, are studied based on data from the LAMOST and Gaia surveys. The star formation in the Galactic thin and thick disc, with peak metallicities of $-0.20$ and $-0.45$ dex, is found to have peaked about 5.5 and 12.5 Gyr ago, respectively. The thin disc is also found to have experienced an initial star formation burst about 12.5 Gyr ago. The pro-grade population Splash and hot-disc (HD), with peak metallicity of about $-0.60$ and $-0.43$, are found to be about 13.03 and 12.21 Gyr old, respectively, with peak eccentricity of 0.70 and 0.35, are understood to be of in situ origin. The Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GE/S), Thamnos, and Sequoia, with peak metallicity of about $-1.31$, $-1.36$, and $-1.56$, are found to be about 11.66, 12.89, and 12.18 Gyr old, respectively, and are understood to be remnants of dwarf galaxies merged with the Milky Way. The HD, Splash, and Thamnos are found to have experienced chemical evolution similar to the thick disc while GE/S, Sequoia, and Helmi stream are found to have experienced distinct chemical enrichment of iron and $\alpha$-process elements.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered at redshift $z\lesssim2.5$ are presumed to be produced from Population (Pop) I/II stars. {In this work, we investigate the production of SNe Ia from Pop III binaries in the cosmological framework. We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a theoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate the likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from recent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a considerable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be the dominant SN Ia producer at z $\gtrsim 6$.} {In an optimistic scenario, we expect $\sim 1(2)$ SNe Ia from Pop III stars at $z\approx 4(5)$ for a survey of area $300 \;\rm arcmin^2$ during a $3\;\rm yr$ period with JWST. The same survey may record more than $\sim 400$ SNe Ia at lower redshift ($z\lesssim 2.5$) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be $\sim 6$ Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of $5-10$.} Observational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of $5-10$ can place crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.</description>

      <title>Old neutron stars as a new probe of relic neutrinos and sterile neutrino dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Absorption in LAMOST low Resolution Normalized Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies like the Milky Way form hierarchically, and many supporting evidences have been found in the Galactic halo. However, most stars in the Milky Way are disk stars. Disk stars have almost lost their spatial distribution and kinematic features at birth, retaining solely chemical signatures. Identifying such substructures using abundances of iron or light elements is difficult due to their high degeneracy. Heavy elements, especially neutron capture elements have limited sources so have lower degeneracy, but spectral line fitting of these elements is tough, requiring mid to high resolution spectra, which are currently limited in sample size. This work utilizes the collective effect of many spectral lines from several elements, especially neutron capture elements to weaken the degeneracy of [Fe/H]. The analysis suggests the presence of at least 12 clusters, due to the hierarchical absorption in LAMOST low resolution normalized Spectra. More detailed work is needed to ascertain whether this hierarchical absorption is natural.</description>

      <title>Loki: an ancient system hidden in the Galactic plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse high-resolution ESPaDOnS/CFHT spectra of 20 very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-2.0$) in the solar neighbourhood (within $\sim2$ kpc) selected to be on planar orbits (with a maximum height of $\lesssim4$ kpc). Targets include 11 prograde and 9 retrograde stars, spanning a wide range of eccentricities ($0.20-0.95$). Their chemical abundances are consistent with those observed in the Galactic halo but show a smaller spread, with no notable difference between progrades and retrogrades. This suggests a common chemical evolution and likely a shared formation site (except for one star). In this case, chemical evolution models indicate that the formation site would have had a baryonic mass of $\sim1.4\times10^9\msun$, similar to classical dwarf galaxies. High-energy supernovae and hypernovae are needed to reproduce the [X/Fe] up to the Fe-peak, while fast-rotating massive stars and neutron star merger events explain the [X/Fe] of the neutron-capture elements. The absence of Type Ia supernova signatures suggests a star formation duration of $\lesssim1$~Gyr. Cosmological zoom-in simulations support the scenario that an in-plane infall of a single system could disperse stars over a wide range of angular momenta during the early Galactic assembly. We propose that these stars originated in a proto-Galactic building block, which we name Loki. Less likely, if progrades and retrogrades formed in two different systems, their chemical evolution must have been very similar, with a combined baryonic mass twice that of a single system. Forthcoming surveys will provide a large and homogeneous dataset to investigate whether Loki is associated with any of the known detected structures. A comparison (primarily [$\alpha$/Fe]) with other VMPs moving in planar orbits suggests multiple systems contributed to the Galactic planar population, presenting some differences in their kinematical parameters.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.</description>
