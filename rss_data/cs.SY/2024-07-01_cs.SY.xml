      <title>Microgrid Planner: A Distributed Energy Resource Sizing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a heuristic search method for distrubuted energy resource sizing, released in Microgrid Planner, an open-source software platform. Our method is constructed to identify a wide range of microgrid design options that satisfy a given set of power load requirements, allowing a decision maker to weigh trade-offs between potential designs and select preferred solutions. We introduce a global binary search algorithm to build a diverse set of microgrid design options and refine them using a local linear search method.</description>

      <title>Multi-service collaboration and composition of cloud manufacturing customized production based on problem decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud manufacturing system is a service-oriented and knowledge-based one, which can provide solutions for the large-scale customized production. The service resource allocation is the primary factor that restricts the production time and cost in the cloud manufacturing customized production (CMCP). In order to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost in CMCP, we propose a new framework which considers the collaboration among services with the same functionality. A mathematical evaluation formulation for the service composition and service usage scheme is constructed with the following critical indexes: completion time, cost, and number of selected services. Subsequently, a problem decomposition based genetic algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal service compositions with service usage schemes. A smart clothing customization case is illustrated so as to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the method proposed in this paper. Finally, the results of simulation experiments and comparisons show that these solutions obtained by our method are with the minimum time, a lower cost, and the fewer selected services.</description>

      <title>Practical Power System Inertia Monitoring Based on Pumped Storage Hydropower Operation Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a practical method to monitor power system inertia using Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) switching-off events. This approach offers real-time system-level inertia estimation with minimal expenses, no disruption, and the inclusion of behind-the-meter inertia. First, accurate inertia estimation is achieved through improved RoCoF calculation that accounts for pre-event RoCoF, reducing common random frequency fluctuations in practice. Second, PSH field data is analyzed, highlighting the benefits of using switching-off events for grid inertia estimation. Third, an event detection trigger is designed to capture pump switching-off events based on local and system features. Fourth, the method is validated on the U.S. Eastern Interconnection model with over 60,000 buses, demonstrating very high accuracy (3%-5% error rate). Finally, it is applied to the U.S. Western Interconnection, with field validation showing a 9.9% average absolute error rate. Despite challenges in practical power system inertia estimation, this method enhances decision-making for power grid reliability and efficiency, addressing challenges posed by renewable energy integration.</description>

      <title>Global Regulation of Feedforward Nonlinear Systems: A Logic-Based Switching Gain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the global regulation problem for a class of feedforward nonlinear systems. Notably, the systems under consideration allow unknown input-output-dependent nonlinear growth rates, which has not been considered in existing works. A novel logic-based switching (LBS) gain approach is proposed to counteract system uncertainties and nonlinearities. Furthermore, a tanh-type speed-regulation function is embedded into the switching mechanism for the first time to improve the convergence speed and transient performance. Then, a switching adaptive output feedback (SAOF) controller is proposed based on the developed switching mechanism, which is of a concise form and low-complexity characteristic. It is shown that the objective of global regulation is achieved with faster convergence speed and better transient performance under the proposed controller. Moreover, by strengthening the switching mechanism, the improved control approach can deal with feedforward nonlinear systems with external disturbances. Finally, representative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach in comparison with the existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Condition monitoring of wind turbine blades via learning-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the topic of condition monitoring of wind turbine blades and presents a learning-based approach to fault detection. The proposed scheme utilises Principal Components Analysis and Autoencoders to derive data-driven models from root-bending moment and other measurements. The models are trained with real data obtained from a fault-free wind turbine, and then validated on data corresponding to unknown health condition. Online test statistics, employing static thresholds and Generalized Likelihood Ratio tests, are used on residual signals generated by discrepancies between the actual and reconstructed measurements to detect deviations from nominal operation. The efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated using real-life data collected from wind turbines experiencing blade faults.</description>

      <title>Identifying Ordinary Differential Equations for Data-efficient Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of a mathematical dynamics model is a crucial step in the designing process of a controller. However, it is often very difficult to identify the system's governing equations, especially in complex environments that combine physical laws of different disciplines. In this paper, we present a new approach that allows identifying an ordinary differential equation by means of a physics-informed machine learning algorithm. Our method introduces a special neural network that allows exploiting prior human knowledge to a certain degree and extends it autonomously, so that the resulting differential equations describe the system as accurately as possible. We validate the method on a Duffing oscillator with simulation data and, additionally, on a cascaded tank example with real-world data. Subsequently, we use the developed algorithm in a model-based reinforcement learning framework by alternately identifying and controlling a system to a target state. We test the performance by swinging-up an inverted pendulum on a cart.</description>

      <title>Composite Adaptive Disturbance Rejection in Robotics via Instrumental Variables based DREM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider trajectory tracking problem for robotic systems affected by unknown external perturbations. Considering possible solutions, we restrict our attention to composite adaptation, which, particularly, ensures parametric error convergence being desirable to enhance overall stability and robustness of a closed-loop system. At the same time, existing composite approaches cannot simultaneously relax stringent persistence of excitation requirement and guarantee convergence of parametric error to zero for a perturbed scenario. So, a new composite adaptation scheme is proposed, which successfully overcomes mentioned problems of known counterparts and has several salient features. First, it includes a novel adaptive disturbance rejection control law for a general n-DoF dynamical model in the Euler-Lagrange form, which, without achievement of the parameter estimation goal, ensures global stability via application of a high-gain external torque observer augmented with some adaptation law. Secondly, such law is extended with a composite summand derived via the recently proposed Instrumental Variables based Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing procedure, which relaxes excitation conditions and ensures asymptotic parameter estimation and reference tracking in the presence of external torque under some non-restrictive assumptions. An illustrative example shows the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach in comparison with existing solutions.</description>

      <title>`Just One More Sensor is Enough' -- Iterative Water Leak Localization with Physical Simulation and a Small Number of Pressure Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an approach to leak localisation in a complex water delivery grid with the use of data from physical simulation (e.g. EPANET software). This task is usually achieved by a network of multiple water pressure sensors and analysis of the so-called sensitivity matrix of pressure differences between the network's simulated data and actual data of the network affected by the leak. However, most algorithms using this approach require a significant number of pressure sensors -- a condition that is not easy to fulfil in the case of many less equipped networks. Therefore, we answer the question of whether leak localisation is possible by utilising very few sensors but having the ability to relocate one of them. Our algorithm is based on physical simulations (EPANET software) and an iterative scheme for mobile sensor relocation. The experiments show that the proposed system can equalise the low number of sensors with adjustments made for their positioning, giving a very good approximation of leak's position both in simulated cases and real-life example taken from BattLeDIM competition L-Town data.</description>

      <title>Shock wave in series connected Josephson transmission line: Theoretical foundations and effects of resistive elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01427v13 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study shock wave in the Josephson transmission line (JTL) in the presence of ohmic dissipation. When ohmic resistors shunt the Josephson junctions (JJ) or are introduced in series with the ground capacitors the shock is broadened. When ohmic resistors are in series with the JJ, the shock remains sharp, same as it was in the absence of dissipation. In all the cases considered, ohmic resistors don't influence the shock propagation velocity. We study an alternative to the shock wave - an expansion fan - in the framework of the simple wave approximation for the dissipationless JTL and formulate the generalization of the approximation for the JTL with ohmic dissipation.</description>

      <title>The kinks, the solitons and the shocks in series connected discrete Josephson transmission lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11008v11 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study the localized running waves in the discrete Josephson transmission lines (JTL), constructed from Josephson junctions (JJ) and capacitors. The quasi-continuum approximation reduces calculation of the running wave properties to the problem of equilibrium of an elastic rod in the potential field. Making additional approximation, we reduce the problem to the motion of the fictitious Newtonian particle in the potential well. We show that there exist running waves in the form of supersonic kinks and solitons and calculate their velocities and profiles. We show that the nonstationary smooth waves which are small perturbations on the homogeneous non-zero background are described by Korteweg-de Vries equation, and those on zero background -- by modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. We also study the effect of dissipation on the running waves in JTL and find that in the presence of the resistors, shunting the JJ and/or in series with the ground capacitors, the only possible stationary running waves are the shock waves, whose profiles are also found. Finally in the framework of Stocks expansion we study the nonlinear dispersion and modulation stability in the discrete JTL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07990v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the modulated harmonic wave in the discrete series connected Josephson transmission line (JTL). We formulate the approach to the modulation problems for discrete wave equations based on discrete calculus. We check up the approach by applying it to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type problem. Applying the approach to the discrete JTL, we obtain the equation describing the modulation amplitude, which turns out to be the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. We compare the profile of the single soliton solution of the NLS with that of the soliton obtained in our previous publication.</description>

Abstract: We consider the series-connected Josephson transmission line (JTL), constructed from Josephson junctions, capacitors and (possibly) resistors. We calculate the velocity of shocks in the discrete lossy JTL. We study thoroughly the continuum and the quasi-continuum approximations to the discrete JTL, both lossless and lossy. In the framework of these approximations we show that the compact travelling waves in the lossless JTL are the kinks and the solitons, and calculate their velocities. On top of each of the above mentioned approximations, we propose the simple wave approximation, which decouples the JTL equations into two separate equations for the right- and left-going waves. The approximation, in particular, allows to easily consider the formation of shocks in the lossy JTL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15078v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our previous studies of the shocks in the lossy Josephson transmission line (JTL). The paper consists of two parts. In the first part we analyse the scattering of the "sound' (small amplitude small wave vector harmonic wave) on the shock wave and calculate the reflection and the transmission coefficients. In the second part we show that the kinks, which we previously studied only in the lossless JTL, exist also in the lossy JTL and study the similarities and the dissimilarities between the shocks and the kinks there. We find that the nonlinear equation describing the weak kinks and the weak shocks can be integrated (in particular cases) in terms of elementary functions. We also show that the profile of the shock in the lossy JTL demonstrates soliton-like features if the losses are weak.</description>

      <title>A Thermal Study of Terahertz Induced Protein Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins can be regarded as thermal nanosensors in an intra-body network. Upon being stimulated by Terahertz (THz) frequencies that match their vibrational modes, protein molecules experience resonant absorption and dissipate their energy as heat, undergoing a thermal process. This paper aims to analyze the effect of THz signaling on the protein heat dissipation mechanism. We therefore deploy a mathematical framework based on the heat diffusion model to characterize how proteins absorb THz-electromagnetic (EM) energy from the stimulating EM fields and subsequently release this energy as heat to their immediate surroundings. We also conduct a parametric study to explain the impact of the signal power, pulse duration, and interparticle distance on the protein thermal analysis. In addition, we demonstrate the relationship between the change in temperature and the opening probability of thermally-gated ion channels. Our results indicate that a controlled temperature change can be achieved in an intra-body environment by exciting protein particles at their resonant frequencies. We further verify our results numerically using COMSOL Multiphysics and introduce an experimental framework that assesses the effects of THz radiation on protein particles. We conclude that under controlled heating, protein molecules can serve as hotspots that impact thermally-gated ion channels. Through the presented work, we infer that the heating process can be engineered on different time and length scales by controlling the THz-EM signal input.</description>

      <title>Funplex: A Modified Simplex Algorithm to Efficiently Explore Near-Optimal Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) is an increasingly popular method in energy system optimization. MGA explores the near-optimal space, namely, system alternatives whose costs are within a certain fraction of the globally optimal cost. Real-world stakeholders may prefer these alternatives due to intangible factors. Nonetheless, widespread MGA adoption is hampered by its additional computational burden. Current MGA methods identify boundary points of the near-optimal space through repeated, independent optimization problems. Hundreds of model runs are usually required, and such individual runs are often inefficient because they repeat calculations or retrace previous trajectories. In this study, we transcend such limitations by introducing a novel algorithm called Funplex, which uses methods from multi-objective Simplex to optimize many MGA objectives with minimal computational redundancy. For a simple linear-programming energy hub case study, we show that Funplex is five times faster than existing methods and yields higher-quality near-optimal spaces. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses suggest that Funplex scales well with the number of investment variables, making it promising for capacity planning models. The current proof-of-concept implementation based on a full multi-objective tableau may face memory and stability limitations for large models. Nonetheless, future developments based on more advanced versions of Simplex may overcome such barriers, thereby making MGA more accessible and standard among modeling teams.</description>

      <title>Koopman based trajectory model and computation offloading for high mobility paradigm in ISAC enabled IoT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User experience on mobile devices is constrained by limited battery capacity and processing power, but 6G technology advancements are diving rapidly into mobile technical evolution. Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers a solution, offloading computationally intensive tasks to edge cloud servers, reducing battery drain compared to local processing. The upcoming integrated sensing and communication in mobile communication may improve the trajectory prediction and processing delays. This study proposes a greedy resource allocation optimization strategy for multi-user networks to minimize aggregate energy usage. Numerical results show potential improvement at 33\% for every 1000 iteration. Addressing prediction model division and velocity accuracy issues is crucial for better results. A plan for further improvement and achieving objectives is outlined for the upcoming work phase.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture, with only a few reasonable assumptions about network structure, has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme significantly accelerates convergence over the independent case (and often even the centralised case), without relying on the assumption of a centralised learner. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that the networked approach has significant advantages, over both the centralised and independent alternatives, in terms of robustness to unexpected learning failures and to changes in population size.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization of Initial Perturbations toward Quantitative Weather Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes introducing convex optimization to find initial perturbations of atmospheric models for realizing specified changes in subsequent forecasts. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The sensitivity matrix is used to solve the inverse problem as convex optimization, in which a global optimal solution can be found computationally efficiently. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using an NWP model. The experiments showed that identified perturbation successfully realized specified spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation. These results demonstrated the possibility of controlling the real atmosphere by solving inverse problems and adding small perturbations to atmospheric states.</description>

      <title>Solving Differential Equations using Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Physics-Informed Deep Equilibrium Models (PIDEQs) for solving initial value problems (IVPs) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Leveraging recent advancements in deep equilibrium models (DEQs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), PIDEQs combine the implicit output representation of DEQs with physics-informed training techniques. We validate PIDEQs using the Van der Pol oscillator as a benchmark problem, demonstrating their efficiency and effectiveness in solving IVPs. Our analysis includes key hyperparameter considerations for optimizing PIDEQ performance. By bridging deep learning and physics-based modeling, this work advances computational techniques for solving IVPs, with implications for scientific computing and engineering applications.</description>
