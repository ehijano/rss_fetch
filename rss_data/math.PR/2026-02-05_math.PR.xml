      <title>Functional Stochastic Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eldan's stochastic localization is a probabilistic construction that has proved instrumental to modern breakthroughs in high-dimensional geometry and the design of sampling algorithms. Motivated by sampling under non-Euclidean geometries and the mirror descent algorithm in optimization, we develop a functional generalization of Eldan's process that replaces Gaussian regularization with regularization by any positive integer multiple of a log-Laplace transform. We further give a mixing time bound on the Markov chain induced by our localization process, which holds if our target distribution satisfies a functional Poincar\'e inequality. Finally, we apply our framework to differentially private convex optimization in $\ell_p$ norms for $p \in [1, 2)$, where we improve state-of-the-art query complexities in a zeroth-order model.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-driven queuing networks in multi-scale light and heavy traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a queueing network with a strictly upper-triangular routing matrix, where each column contains at most one non-negative entry, and the root node receives input from a spectrally positive L\'{e}vy process. Our aim is to characterize the distribution of the multivariate stationary workload under a specific scaling of the service rates. Under mild conditions on the Laplace exponent of the driving L\'{e}vy process, we identify the limiting law of an appropriately scaled joint stationary workload in both light-traffic and heavy-traffic regimes. In particular, we establish conditions under which certain queueing workloads within the network asymptotically decouple, becoming independent in the limiting regime.</description>

      <title>A Note on Physical Dependence and Mixing Conditions for Triangular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under mild structural assumptions and regularity conditions on the marginal and conditional densities, an explicit bound on the $\beta$-mixing coefficients in terms of the physical dependence measure is provided. Consequently, weak physical dependence implies $\beta$-mixing and strong mixing for triangular arrays, complementing Hill (2025), who proved the converse implication under moment assumptions.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the stochastic Levy--Lorentz gas driven by general long-range reference random walk on correlated and entangled random medium. Further consideration has been laid on the stochastic reinforcement of the underlying random walk, where it now possesses memory. Central limit theorems are obtained in both cases.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to SDEs with singular drifts driven by fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the strong well-posedness of SDEs with merely integrable time-dependent drifts driven by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst parameter H&lt;1/2. Our result holds over the entire subcritical regime and can be regarded as an extension of (Krylov and Rockner, Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 131(2): 154-196 (2005)) to the fractional case. Furthermore, we prove the existence of stochastic flows of Sobolev diffeomorphisms for this class of SDEs, which generalizes a result in (Mohammed et al., Ann. Probab. 43, 1535-1576 (2015)). The approach adopted in our work is based on a compactness criterion for random fields in Wiener spaces.</description>

      <title>On the local nature of the de Almeida-Thouless line for mixed \(p\)-spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jagannath and Tobasco~\cite{JagTob} proposed a generalized de Almeida-Thouless (AT) criterion aimed at characterizing the replica symmetric (RS) regime for a broad class of mixed \(p\)-spin glass models with Ising spins. In this paper, we show that this generalized AT condition does not characterize the RS regime in general. Using the Hopf-Lax representation of the Parisi formula, we construct explicit counterexamples within the class of mixed \(p\)-spin models. In particular, we exhibit a model in which the classical AT perturbation is performed around the unique minimizer of the RS free energy, and prove that even in this setting, the AT criterion fails to characterize the RS phase. By contrast, the validity of the classical AT condition for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model remains open.</description>

      <title>Disordered systems and (subcritical) polynomial chaos with heavy-tail disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete statistical mechanics systems perturbed by a random environment without a finite second moment. Specifically, we consider a random environment whose tail distribution satisfies $P[\omega &gt; x] \sim x^{-\gamma}$ as $x \to +\infty$ for some $\gamma \in (1,2)$. Inspired by the seminal work of Caravenna, Sun and Zygouras \cite{csz_2016}, we adopt a general framework that encompasses as key examples both the disordered pinning model and the long-range directed polymer model. We provide some subcriticality condition under which we prove that the discrete disordered system possesses a non-trivial scaling limit. We also interpret the subcriticality condition in terms of a generalized Harris criterion without second moment, which gives a prediction for disorder relevance depending on the parameters of the system. Our analysis relies on the study of multilinear polynomials of independent heavy-tailed random variables known as polynomial chaos and their continuous analogue, given by multiple integrals with respect to a $\gamma$-stable L\'evy white noise. We develop precise and flexible moments estimates adapted to the heavy-tailed setting.</description>

      <title>How seed banks evolve in plants: a stochastic dynamical system subject to a strong drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how changes in population size and fluctuating environmental conditions influence the establishment of seed banks in plants. Our model is a modification of the Wright-Fisher model with seed bank, introduced by Kaj, Krone and Lascoux. We distinguish between wild type individuals, producing only nondormant seeds, and mutants, producing seeds with dormancy. To understand how changing population size shapes the establishment of seed banks, we analyse the process under a diffusive scaling. The results support the biological insight that seed banks are favoured in a declining population, and disfavoured if population size is constant or increasing. The surprise is that this is true even when population sizes are changing very slowly -- over evolutionary timescales. We also investigate the influence of short-term fluctuations, such as annual variations in rainfall or temperature. Mathematically, our analysis reduces to a stochastic dynamical system forced onto a manifold by a large drift, which converges under scaling to a diffusion on the manifold. Inspired by the Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, we derive an explicit formula for the limiting diffusion coefficients by projecting the system onto its linear counterpart. This provides a general framework for deriving diffusion approximations in models with strong drift and nonlinear constraints.</description>

      <title>Smooth Multi-Trace Statistics of Classical Ensembles: Large $N$ Expansions, Cumulants, and Matrix Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider expectations of the form $E [tr h_1(X_1^N)... tr h_r(X_r^N)]$, where $X_i^N$ are self-adjoint polynomials in various independent classical random matrices and $h_i$ are smooth test function and obtain a large $N$ expansion of these quantities, building on the framework of polynomial approximation and Bernstein-type inequalities recently developed by Chen, Garza-Vargas, Tropp, and van Handel. As applications of the above, we prove the higher-order asymptotic vanishing of cumulants for smooth linear statistics, establish a Central Limit Theorem, and demonstrate the existence of formal asymptotic expansions for the free energy and observables of matrix integrals with smooth potentials.</description>

      <title>Brownian paths as loop-decorated SLEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an application, which takes as input a simple path and a possibly infinite collection of loops, and outputs a continuous path by adding the loops chronologically to the simple path as the simple path encounters them. By studying the regularity properties of this application and using lattice discretisations, we prove that chronologically adding the loops from a Brownian loop soup encountered by an independent radial SLE$_2$ path produces a continuous path which has the law of a planar Brownian motion. This resolves a conjecture of Lawler and Werner.
  This construction produces a coupling between SLE$_2$ and Brownian motion, and we further show that this joint law is the scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk and the random walk itself. The arguments are robust and can be applied for instance in the off-critical setup, where the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk is Makarov and Smirnov's massive SLE$_2$.</description>

      <title>Vistas of Algebraic Probability: Quantum Computation and Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov's foundation of probability takes measure spaces, $\sigma$-algebras, and probability measures as basic objects. It is, however, widely recognized that this classical framework is inadequate for random phenomena involving quantum effects, and more generally for \emph{quantum-like} situations. A broader formulation is provided by an algebraic viewpoint: one starts from an algebra of random variables equipped with a distinguished linear functional -- the \emph{state} -- interpreted as expectation. In this sense, the approach can also be viewed as a modern reading of ideas already implicit in early probability (e.g., the Bernoullis), while its contemporary form has been developed and used extensively in quantum physics.
  The algebraic framework accommodates both classical and quantum-like behaviours, yet it remains underused in classical probability and uncertainty quantification, where it can nevertheless open new perspectives and clarify structural features. Although the language carries a physics flavor, the subject is purely probabilistic. The key distinction between classical and quantum-like behaviour is \emph{commutativity}: its failure produces the characteristic effects of quantum-like situations. The rise of quantum computing is a prominent setting in which such behaviour may become relevant even for practitioners in computational science. Here we focus on the purely algebraic core of the approach. By restricting attention to finite-dimensional algebras, we avoid many analytical subtleties while retaining the main ideas, their classical limit, and their applicability to quantum-like models and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics simulations of large deviations for three subclasses of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have gradually deepened our understanding of the one-dimensional (1D) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class even in the large deviation regime, but numerical methods for studying KPZ large deviations remain limited. Here we implement a method based on the population dynamics algorithm for studying large deviations of time-integrated local currents in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), which is a pragmatic model in the 1D KPZ class. Carrying out simulations for the three representative initial conditions, namely step, flat, and stationary ones, we not only confirm theoretical predictions available for the step case, but also characterize large deviations for the flat and stationary cases which have not been investigated before. We reveal in particular an unexpected robustness of the deeply negative large deviation regime with respect to different initial conditions. We attribute this robustness to the spontaneous formation of a wedge shape in interface profile. Our population dynamics approach may serve as a versatile method for studying large deviations in the KPZ class numerically and, potentially, even experimentally.</description>

      <title>Unit Shiha Distribution and its Applications to Engineering and Medical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing need for flexible statistical distributions that can accurately model data defined on the unit interval. This paper introduces a new unit distribution, termed the unit Shiha (USh) distribution, which is derived from the original Shiha (Sh) distribution through an inverse exponential transformation. The probability density function of the USh distribution is sufficiently flexible to model both left- and right-skewed data, while its hazard rate function is capable of capturing various failure-rate patterns, including increasing, bathtub-shaped, and J-shaped forms. Several statistical properties of the proposed distribution are investigated, including moments and related measures, the quantile function, entropy, and stress-strength reliability. Parameter estimation is carried out using the maximum likelihood method, and its performance is evaluated through a simulation study. The practical usefulness of the USh distribution is demonstrated using four real-life data sets, and its performance is compared with several well-known competing unit distributions. The comparative results indicate that the proposed model fits the data better than the competitive models applied in this study.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Boltzmann equation from hard-sphere dynamics (after Y. Deng, Z. Hani, and X. Ma)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a microscopic system of $N$ hard spheres that are initially independent (modulo the exclusion condition on particle positions) and identically distributed in $\mathbb{R}^3$. When the number $N$ of particles goes to infinity and the diameter $\varepsilon$ of the particles goes to zero, and under the weak density assumption $N\varepsilon^2=1$, it has been known since the work of Lanford that the empirical measure for the particles converges to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in a short time interval. In particular, the particles remain dynamically independent, in this limit and in the short time interval where the correlations induced by their collisions remain under control. In a recent work, Y. Deng, Z. Hani and X. Ma successfully obtained the same convergence result in arbitrary large time; more precisely, the convergence result holds for any time interval on which the Boltzmann equation has a regular solution. In this note, we explain a few elements of their proof.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of stochastic primitive equations with relaxed hydrostatic assumption as a higher order approximation of 3D stochastic Navier-Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of solutions of a stochastic representation of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations to those of their primitive equations counterpart. Our analysis covers both weak and strong convergence regimes, corresponding respectively to rigid-lid and "fully periodic" boundary conditions. Furthermore, we explore the impact of relaxing the hydrostatic assumption in the stochastic primitive equations by retaining martingale terms as deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. This modified model, obtained through a specific asymptotic scaling accessible only within the stochastic framework, captures non-hydrostatic effects while remaining within the primitive equations formalism. The resulting generalized hydrostatic model has been shown to be well-posed when the additional terms are regularized using a suitable filter for divergence-free noises under suitable assumptions. Within this setting, we demonstrate that the model provides a higher-order approximation of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for appropriately scaled noises.</description>

      <title>Universality of General Spiked Tensor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rank-one spiked tensor model in the high-dimensional regime, where the noise entries are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, unit variance, and finite fourth moment.This setting extends the classical Gaussian framework to a substantially broader class of noise distributions.Focusing on asymmetric tensors of order $d$ ($\ge 3$), we analyze the maximum likelihood estimator of the best rank-one approximation.Under a mild assumption isolating informative critical points of the associated optimization landscape, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of a suitably defined block-wise tensor contraction converges almost surely to a deterministic limit that coincides with the Gaussian case.As a consequence, the asymptotic singular value and the alignments between the estimated and true spike directions admit explicit characterizations identical to those obtained under Gaussian noise. These results establish a universality principle for spiked tensor models, demonstrating that their high-dimensional spectral behavior and statistical limits are robust to non-Gaussian noise.
  Our analysis relies on resolvent methods from random matrix theory, cumulant expansions valid under finite moment assumptions, and variance bounds based on Efron-Stein-type arguments. A key challenge in the proof is how to handle the statistical dependence between the signal term and the noise term.</description>

      <title>Multivariate and quantitative Erd\H{o}s-Kac laws for Beatty sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem states that for $n$ chosen uniformly at random from $1, \dots, N$, the random variable $(\omega(n) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges in distribution to the standard Gaussian as $N$ tends to infinity. Banks and Shparlinski showed that this Gaussian convergence holds for any Beatty sequence $\lfloor\alpha n + \beta\rfloor$ in place of $n$. Continuing in this spirit, Crn\v{c}evi\'c, Hern\'andez, Rizk, Sereesuchart and Tao considered the joint distribution of $\omega(n)$ and $\omega(\lfloor\alpha n\rfloor)$, which they showed to be asymptotically independent for irrational values of $\alpha$.
  Generalising both results, we show that for any positive integer $k$, real numbers $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k &gt; 0$ and $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_k$, where $\alpha_i/\alpha_j$ is irrational for $i\neq j$, the joint distribution of $(\omega(\lfloor\alpha_in + \beta_i\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ converges to the $k$-dimensional standard Gaussian.
  We next discuss quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence which do not depend on the values taken by the relevant parameters. Banks and Shparlinski remarked that such quantitative bounds may be given for a single Beatty sequence $\lfloor\alpha n + \beta\rfloor$ under Diophantine type assumptions on $\alpha$. We show that such assumptions are in fact unnecessary. Specifically, for any real numbers $\alpha &gt; 0, \beta$, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the random variable $(\omega(\lfloor\alpha n + \beta\rfloor) - \log\log N)/\sqrt{\log\log N}$ and the standard Gaussian is bounded above by $O(\log\log\log N/\sqrt{\log\log N})$ as $N$ tends to infinity.
  On the other hand, we show that universal quantitative bounds of this kind do not exist for higher-degree generalised polynomials or for the joint convergence for multiple Beatty sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.09552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The binomial, the negative binomial, the Poisson, the compound Poisson and the Erlang distribution do all admit integral representations with respect to its (continuous) parameter. We use the Margulis-Russo type formulas for Bernoulli and Poisson processes to derive these representations in a unified way and to provide a probabilistic interpretation for the derivatives. By similar variational methods, we obtain apparently new integro-differential identities which the density of a strictly $\alpha$-stable multivariate density satisfies. Then, we extend Crofton's derivative formula known in integral geometry to the case of a Poisson process. Finally we use this extension to give a new probabilistic proof of a version of this formula for binomial point processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral gap behavior of an operator obtained by summing a random permutation $M$ and a deterministic bistochastic matrix $Q$. We are interested in the asymptotic in terms of dimension. In the case where $(M,Q)$ are asymptotically free with amalgamation over the diagonal, we can compute limit operators $(u,q)$ which give the weak limit spectral distribution. Therefore we introduce free with amalgamation operators that are suitable for computing the spectral gap limit of our operator in high dimensions. We then approximate the spectral radius of the corresponding limit operator and finally give an upper bound for the spectral radius of the finite-dimensional operator. In particular, we show that if the deterministic matrix underlying graph is an expander, then the underlying graph associated to the sum with a random permutation is again an expander.</description>

Abstract: We show that a site percolation is a stronger model than a bond percolation. We use the van den Berg -- Kesten (vdBK) inequality to prove that site percolation on a neighborhood of a vertex of degree $4$ cannot be simulated even approximately by bond percolation, and develop a decision tree technique to prove the same for a neighborhood of a vertex of degree $3$. This technique can be used to obtain inequalities for connectedness probabilities, including a conjectured inequality of Erik Aas.</description>

      <title>The Eyring-Kramers Law for the Extinction Time of the Contact Process on Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a precise estimate for the mean extinction time of the contact process with a fixed infection rate on a star graph with $N$ leaves. Specifically, we determine not only the exponential main factor but also the exact sub-exponential prefactor in the asymptotic expression for the mean extinction time as $N\to\infty$. Previously, such detailed asymptotic information on the mean extinction time of the contact process was available exclusively for complete graphs. To obtain our results, we first establish an accurate estimate for the stationary distribution of a modified contact process, employing special function theory and refined Laplace's method. Subsequently, we apply a recently developed potential theoretic approach for analyzing metastability in non-reversible Markov processes, enabling us to deduce the asymptotic expression. The integration of these methodologies constitutes a novel approach developed in this paper, one which has not been utilized previously in the study of the contact process.</description>

      <title>On the Mean-Field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: $L^{\infty}$ estimates and extreme value behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the states of the players evolve with time as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with interaction only in the drift terms. Each player controls the drift of the SDE satisfied by her state process, aiming to minimize the expected value of a cost that depends on the paths of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players until a terminal time. When $N \to \infty$, previous works have established Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviation Principles for the state processes when the game is in Nash Equilibrium (the Nash states), by using the Master Equation to construct approximations of those processes that evolve with time as SDEs with classical Mean-Field interaction. Staying in this framework, we improve an existing $L^{1}$ estimate for the total error of approximating all the Nash states to an $L^{\infty}$ one, and we also establish the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the Nash states. The latter initiates the development of an Extreme Value Theory for Stochastic Differential Games.</description>

      <title>Percolation of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field in high dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the set of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field contains an unbounded path in sufficiently high dimensions. This contrasts with the two-dimensional case, where Aru, Papon, and Powell (2023) showed that the set of thick points is totally disconnected. This result has an interesting implication for the exponential metric of the log-correlated Gaussian field: in sufficiently high dimensions, when the parameter $\xi$ is large, the set-to-set distance exponent (if it exists) is negative. This suggests that a new phase may emerge for the exponential metric, which does not appear in two dimensions. In addition, we establish similar results for the set of thick points of the branching random walk. As an intermediate result, we also prove that the critical probability for fractal percolation converges to 0 as $d \to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study vector-valued functional equations with multiple recursive terms that arise naturally when we are dealing with vector-valued multiplicative Lindley-type recursions. Our work is strongly motivated by a wide range of semi-Markovian queueing, and vector-valued autoregressive processes. In all cases, we provide explicit expressions for the joint distribution in terms of Laplace-Stieltjes transforms/generating functions.</description>

      <title>Universality of rational canonical form for random matrices over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study the distribution of the rational canonical form of a random matrix over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, whose entries are independent and $\epsilon$-balanced with $\epsilon\in(0,1-1/p]$. We show that, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the statistics converge to independent Cohen-Lenstra distributions, demonstrating the universality of this asymptotic behavior. In particular, we recover, as a special case, the uniform setting proved by Fulman in his thesis in 1997.
  Our proof uses the fact that the rational canonical form data of $A_n$ and the $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$-module structure of the function field cokernel $\Cok(tI_n-A_n)$ determine each other uniquely. Consequently, our question can be reformulated, equivalently, as the asymptotic distribution problem for this cokernel, which has been established by Cheong-Yu (arXiv:2303.09125).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random connection model (RCM) $\xi$ driven by a Poisson process $\eta$. We derive exponential moment bounds for an arbitrary cluster, provided that the intensity $t$ of $\eta$ is below a certain critical intensity $t_T$. The associated subcritical regime is characterized by a finite mean cluster size, uniformly in space. Under an exponential decay assumption on the connection function, we also show that the cluster diameters are exponentially small as well. In the important stationary marked case and under a uniform moment bound on the connection function, we show that $t_T$ coincides with $t_c$, the largest $t$ for which $\xi$ does not percolate. In this case, we also derive some percolation mean field bounds. These findings generalize some of the recent results. Even in the classical unmarked case, our results are more general than what has been previously known. Our proofs are partially based on some stochastic monotonicity properties, which might be of interest in their own right.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Jump multi-marginal transport (HJMOT), a generalization of multi-marginal optimal transport where mass can "jump" over intermediate spaces via augmented isolated points. Established on Polish spaces, the framework guarantees the existence of Kantorovich solutions and, under sequential differentiability and a twist condition, the existence and uniqueness of Monge solutions. This core theory extends robustly to diverse settings, including smooth Riemannian manifolds, demonstrating its versatility as a unified framework for optimal transport across complex geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical variational setting was recently introduced and shown to be applicable to many important SPDEs not covered by the classical variational setting. In this paper, we extend the critical variational setting in several ways. We introduce a flexibility in the range space for the nonlinear drift term, due to which certain borderline cases can now also be included. An example of this is the Allen-Cahn equation in dimension two in the weak setting. In addition to this, we allow the drift to be singular in time, which is something that naturally arises in the study of the skeleton equations for large deviation principles for SPDEs. Last but not least, we present the theory in the case of L\'evy noise for which the critical setting was not available yet.</description>

While statistical methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Kalman Filtering, Inverse Variable Method, and more have historically been used to estimate the parameters of stochastic differential equations, the recent explosion of deep learning technology suggests that models such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) could produce more precise estimators. We present a series of experiments that compare the estimation accuracy and computational expensiveness of a statistical method (MLE) with a deep learning model (RNN) for the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem, and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.</description>

      <title>On the Tail Transition of First Arrival Position Channels: From Cauchy to Exponential Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the zero-drift first arrival position (FAP) channel is known to exhibit a Cauchy noise distribution, practical molecular communication systems typically operate under nonzero drift. This letter analyzes the resulting transition in FAP noise behavior from heavy-tailed algebraic decay to exponential regularization. By asymptotically examining the exact FAP distribution, we identify a characteristic propagation distance (CPD) $r_c=\sigma^2/v$ that separates diffusion-dominated and drift-dominated regimes. Numerical results show that in low-drift environments, Gaussian approximations substantially underestimate the achievable rate, whereas the zero-drift Cauchy model provides a physically grounded performance baseline.</description>

      <title>Exact 3-D Channel Impulse Response Under Uniform Drift for Absorbing Spherical Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact channel impulse response (CIR) for the three-dimensional point-to-sphere absorbing channel under drift has remained unavailable due to symmetry breaking. This letter closes this gap by deriving an exact analytical CIR for a fully absorbing spherical receiver under uniform drift with arbitrary direction. By formulating the problem in terms of joint first-hitting time-location statistics and applying a Girsanov-based measure change, drift effects are isolated into an explicit multiplicative factor, yielding an exact series representation. The resulting CIR provides a rigorous reference model and enables efficient, noise-free evaluation of key channel metrics without relying on Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning from Neighbors with PHIBP: Predicting Infectious Disease Dynamics in Data-Sparse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Pricing Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a von Neumann algebra and let $(N_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ be an increasing family of abelian von Neumann subalgebras encoding a (classical) information flow. Fix a faithful normal state $\varphi_\rho$ and a filtration of normal $\varphi_\rho$-preserving conditional expectations $E_t:M\to N_t$ satisfying the tower property. Using bounded functional-calculus cutoffs $f_n$, we introduce a truncation-stable notion of localized $(N_t,E_t)$-martingales for affiliated self-adjoint observables, and formulate a \emph{Local Informational Efficiency Principle} requiring symmetrically discounted traded prices to be martingales in this sense. Assuming a pricing state $\varphi^\star$ and a compatible family of normal $\varphi^\star$-preserving conditional expectations $(E_t^\star)$, we define for bounded terminal payoffs $X\in M_T$ the dynamic pricing operator \[ \Pi_t(X):=B_t^{1/2}\,E_t^\star\!\bigl(B_T^{-1/2}XB_T^{-1/2}\bigr)\,B_t^{1/2}, \] where $(B_t)$ is a strictly positive num\'eraire adapted to $(N_t)$. We prove that $(\Pi_t)$ is normal, completely positive, $N_t$-bimodular, and time-consistent, and satisfies $\Pi_t(\mathbf 1)=B_t$ (equivalently, $\widetilde{\Pi}_t(X):=B_t^{-1/2}\Pi_t(X)B_t^{-1/2}$ is unital). In the commutative reduction it agrees with risk-neutral valuation by conditional expectation. Finally, we develop an $L^2(M,\varphi_\rho)$ prediction theory and introduce an operator-valued Fisher information relative to $(N_t)$, obtaining a noncommutative Cram\'er--Rao lower bound for conditional mean-square prediction error; we compute the bound for compound Poisson lattice-jump models under $\sum_{\alpha}\gamma_\alpha(e^{\alpha\Delta x}-1)=r$.</description>

      <title>Habit Formation, Labor Supply, and the Dynamics of Retirement and Annuitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decision to annuitize wealth in retirement planning has become increasingly complex due to rising longevity risk and changing retirement patterns, including increased labor force participation at older ages. While an extensive literature studies consumption, labor, and annuitization decisions, these elements are typically examined in isolation. This paper develops a unified stochastic control and optimal stopping framework in which habit formation and endogenous labor supply shape retirement and annuitization decisions under age-dependent mortality. We derive optimal consumption, labor, portfolio, and annuitization policies in a continuous-time lifecycle model. The solution is characterized via dynamic programming and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Our results reveal a rich sequence of retirement dynamics. When wealth is low relative to habit, labor is supplied defensively to protect consumption standards. As wealth increases, agents enter a work-to-retire phase in which labor is supplied at its maximum level to accelerate access to retirement. Human capital acts as a stabilizing asset, justifying a more aggressive pre-retirement investment portfolio, followed by abrupt de-risking upon annuitization. Subjective mortality beliefs are a key determinant in shaping retirement dynamics. Agents with pessimistic longevity beliefs rationally perceive annuities as unattractive, leading them to avoid or delay annuitization. This framework provides a behavior-based explanation for low annuity demand and offers guidance for retirement planning jointly linking labor supply, portfolio choice, and the timing of annuitization.</description>
