      <title>The chiral torsional anomaly and the Nieh-Yan invariant with and without boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists a long-standing debate regarding the torsion contribution to the 4d chiral anomaly of a Dirac fermion. Central to this debate is the Nieh-Yan anomaly, which has been considered ill-defined and a regularization artifact. Using a heat-kernel approach, we examine the relationship between the Dirac operator index, the Nieh-Yan invariant and the torsional anomaly. We show the Nieh-Yan invariant vanishes on spacetimes without boundaries, if the Dirac index is well-defined. In the known examples of non-vanishing Nieh--Yan invariant on manifolds without boundaries, the heat kernel expansion breaks down, making the index ill-defined. Finally, for finite boundaries we identify several finite bulk and boundary anomaly terms, alongside bulk and boundary Nieh-Yan terms. We construct explicit counterterms that cancel the Nieh-Yan terms and argue that the boundary terms give rise to a torsional anomalous Hall effect. Our results emphasize the importance of renormalization conditions, as these can affect both the thermal and non-thermal Nieh-Yan anomaly coefficients. In addition, we demonstrate that anomalous torsional transport may arise even without relying on the Nieh-Yan invariant.</description>

      <title>NLO in the large charge sector of the critical $O(N)$ model at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the next-to-leading correction to the scaling dimension of large-charge operators in the $3d$ critical $O(N)$ model in a double scaling limit in which both $N$ and the operator charge $Q$ are taken to be large. When $Q \gg N$ our result matches predictions from the conformal superfluid EFT and allows to extract next-to-leading order corrections to the EFT Wilsonian coefficients. At present, our result represents the most precise determination of large-charge operator scaling dimension in weakly-coupled CFTs.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping non-Hermitian Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the ``Bootstrap" technique was applied in Quantum Mechanics to solve the eigenspectra of Hermitian Hamiltonians and extended to non-Hermitian PT-symmetric systems. However, its application has been limited to real spectra. In this work, we establish bootstrap conditions for the non-Hermitian system and generate eigenspectra for a generic complex polynomial potential, which includes PT-symmetric Hamiltonians as a special case. Additionally, we demonstrate the method's ability to obtain eigenspectra under various boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunction, including the notable application of capturing the PT-symmetric phase transition.</description>

      <title>Five dimensional Weyl double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Weyl double copy to five-dimensional spacetime. We show that a special class of five-dimensional type N vacuum solutions admits a special class of degenerate Maxwell field that squares to give the Weyl tensor. The five-dimensional Weyl double copy relation defines a scalar field that satisfies the source-free Klein-Gordon equation on the curved background.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Hodge Theory in String Compactifications and Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the framework of asymptotic Hodge theory and its applications in both the string landscape and the landscape of 2d integrable field theories. We show how this mathematical framework allows for a general characterization of the asymptotic behaviour of physical couplings in low-energy effective theories coming from string theory, and apply this knowledge to investigate the finiteness and geometric structure of the string landscape landscape. At the same time, we find that the defining equations of variations of Hodge structure also arise in the context of certain integrable field theories, which opens the way to finding new classes of very general solutions to said models.
  Part I reviews the relevant aspects of type IIB / F-theory flux compactifications and the resulting landscape of 4d low-energy effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity theories.
  Part II provides an in-depth discussion on asymptotic Hodge theory, including detailed explanations on the nilpotent orbit theorem of Schmid, and the multi-variable Sl(2)-orbit theorem of Cattani, Kaplan, and Schmid. This part of the thesis also contains new results regarding the multi-variable bulk reconstruction procedure, which have not appeared in the author's previous publications.
  Part III concerns the application of the aforementioned results to study the finiteness of the F-theory flux landscape. Additionally, motivated by recent advances in the field of o-minimal geometry and the theory of unlikely intersections, we propose three conjectures which aim to address finer features of the flux landscape.
  Part IV investigates two corners of the landscape of 2d integrable non-linear sigma-models, namely the $\lambda$-deformed gauged WZW model and the critical bi-Yang-Baxter model. Notably, it is shown that asymptotic Hodge theory can be used to find broad classes of solutions these models.</description>

      <title>Deviations from maximal entanglement for eigenstates of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mid-spectrum eigenstates of the Sachdev-Ye-Kiteav (SYK) model. We prove that for subsystems whose size is a constant fraction of the system size, the entanglement entropy deviates from the maximum entropy by at least a positive constant. This result highlights the difference between the entanglement entropy of mid-spectrum eigenstates of the SYK model and that of random states.</description>

      <title>Scalar field theory under Robin boundary conditions: two-point function and energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider four-dimensional scalar field theory in presence of Robin boundary conditions on two parallel plates. These boundary conditions are directly imposed in the path integral definition of the theory via auxiliary fields living on the plates. We discuss how this leads to boundary corrections to the standard energy momentum tensor operator. Via a dimensional reduction to an effective three-dimensional boundary theory, we compute the Casimir energy in terms of the plate separation and the two Robin parameters, as well as the scalar field propagator in the presence of the plates. Coincidentally, the boundary contribution vanishes in the expectation value for the vacuum energy, thereby giving results in full accordance with other energy expressions in the literature for the same setup. We also discuss for which values of the Robin parameters this energy is real-valued.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Extremality in Power-law AdS Black Holes A Universal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the universal relation between Goon and Penco (GP) proposed within the frameworks of Power-Maxwell, Power-Yang-Mills, and Maxwell-Power-Yang-Mills black holes. We begin by analyzing these black holes' thermodynamics and then calculating the perturbed metric and thermodynamic quantities by perturbing the action. Our objective is to examine the consistency of the GP relation across various power-law terms in the field equations, aiming to gain deeper insights into the nature of these black holes. The GP connection remains robust across different power spacetimes, indicating that this relation is a universal feature of black holes.</description>

      <title>The effect of resummation on retarded Green's function and greybody factor in $AdS$ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the retarded Green's function and the greybody factor in asymptotically AdS black holes. Using the connection coefficients of the Heun equation, expressed in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) free energy of an $SU(2)$ supersymmetric gauge theory with four fundamental hypermultiplets, we derive asymptotic expansions for both the retarded Green's function and the greybody factor in the small horizon limit. Furthermore, we compute the corrections to these asymptotic expansions resulting from the resummation procedure of the instanton part of the NS function.</description>

      <title>Is the type-D NUT C-metric really "missing" from the most general Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It remains a long-standing problem, unsettled for almost two decades in General Relativity (GR) community, ever since Griffiths and Podolsky demonstrated in Ref. [J.B. Griffiths and J. Podolsky, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, 3467 (2005)] that the type-D NUT C-metric seems to be absent from the most general family of the type-D Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski (P-D) solution. However, Astorino [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084038 (2024)] presented a different form of rotating and accelerating black holes and showed that all known four-dimensional type-D accelerating black holes (without the NUT charge) can be recovered via various different limits in a definitive fashion. In particular, he provided, for the first time, the correct expressions for the type-D static accelerating black holes with a nonzero NUT charge, which was previously impossible using the traditional parametrization of the familiar P-D solution. Nevertheless, it still remains elusive that how these two different forms of the four-dimensional rotating and accelerating solutions are related. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by finding the obvious coordinate transformations and parameter identifications between the vacuum metrics after two different parameterizations of the generated solution via the inverse scattering method from the seed metric -- the Rindler vacuum background. We then resolve this ``missing" puzzle by providing another M\"{o}bius transformation and linear combinations of the Killing coordinates, which clearly cast the type-D NUT C-metric into the familiar form of the P-D solution. Additionally, we propose an alternative new routine for the normalization of the obtained metric derived via the inverse scattering method from the vacuum seed solution, which could be potentially useful for the construction of higher-dimensional solutions using the trivial vacuum background as the seed metric.</description>

      <title>Basics of Multiple Polyexponential Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of special functions called multiple polyexponential integrals, defined as iterated integrals of the exponential integral $\text{Ei}(z)$. These functions arise in certain perturbative expansions of the local solutions of second-order ODEs around an irregular singularity. In particular, their recursive definition describes the asymptotic behavior of these local solutions. To complement the study of the multiple polyexponential integrals on the entire complex plane, we relate them with two other sets of special functions - the undressed and dressed multiple polyexponential functions - which are characterized by their Taylor series expansions around the origin.</description>

      <title>Accelerated detector in a superposed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of a full-fledged theory of quantum gravity, operational approaches offer insights into quantum-gravitational effects produced by quantum superposition of different spacetimes not diffeomorphic to one another. Recent work applies this approach to superpose cylindrically identified Minkowski spacetimes (i.e. periodic boundary conditions) with different characteristic circumferences, where a two-level detector coupled to a quantum field residing in the spacetime exhibits resonance peaks in response at certain values of the superposed length ratios. Here, we extend this analysis to a superposition of cylindrically identified Rindler spacetimes, considering a two-level detector constantly accelerated in the direction orthogonal to the compact dimension. Similarly to previous work, we find resonance peaks in the detector response at rational ratios of the superposed compactified lengths, which we observe to be accentuated by the acceleration of the detector. Furthermore, for the first time we confirm the detailed balance condition due to acceleration in a superposition of spacetimes, commensurate with the Unruh effect in a single spacetime state. The resonant structure of detector response in the presence of event horizons, for the first time observed in 3+1 dimensions, may offer clues to the nature of black hole entropy in the full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing inflation and reheating in the framework of a generalized $\mathcal{F}(H)$ Friedmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of an inflationary universe considering the parametrization of the scalar spectral index as a function of the number of $e-$folds in the framework of a modified Friedmann equation is analyzed. In this context, we examine the possibility of reconstructing the Hubble parameter together with the effective potential considering a modified Friedmann equation specified by $\mathcal{F}(H)\propto \rho$, where $\mathcal{F}(H)$ corresponds to an arbitrary function of the Hubble parameter $H$ and $\rho$ denotes the energy density associated with the matter in the universe. To reconstruct the background variables during the inflationary scenario, we develop a new methodology by expressing the spectral index in terms of the Hubble parameter and its derivatives. Thus, we obtain a general formalism for the reconstruction of the inflation, using the slow roll approximation together with the parametrization of the scalar spectral index as a function of the number of $e-$folds $N$. As specific examples, we consider the simplest attractor $n_s-1=-2/N$ together with different functions $\mathcal{F}(H)$, associated to the modified Friedmann equation, to rebuild the Hubble parameter and the effective potential in terms of the scalar field $\phi$. Additionally, we examine the reheating epoch by considering a constant equation of state parameter, in which we determine the temperature and the number of e-folds during this epoch, using the background variables found during the reconstruction of the different $\mathcal{F}(H)-$models studied. Besides, we constrain the different parameters associated with the reconstructed inflationary $\mathcal{F}(H)-$models during the epochs of inflation and reheating, using current astronomical data from Planck and BICEP/Keck results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determinant of an anti-symmetric matrix $g$ is the square of its Pfaffian, which like the determinant is a polynomial in the entries of $g$. Studies of certain super conformal field theories (of class S) suggested a conjectural generalization of this, predicting that each of a series of other polynomials in the entries of $g$ also admit polynomial square roots. Among other consequences, this conjecture led to a characterization of the local Hitchin image for type D. Several important special cases had been established previously. In this paper we prove the conjecture in full.</description>

Abstract: A derived algebraic geometric study of classical $\mathrm{GL}_n$-Yang-Mills theory on the $2$-dimensional square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is presented. The derived critical locus of the Wilson action is described and its local data supported in rectangular subsets $V =[a,b]\times [c,d]\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ with both sides of length $\geq 2$ is extracted. A locally constant dg-category-valued prefactorization algebra on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is constructed from the dg-categories of perfect complexes on the derived stacks of local data.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <title>From Feynman integrals to quantum algorithms: the Loop-Tree Duality connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of high-energy particle physics, a reliable theory-experiment confrontation requires precise theoretical predictions. This translates into accessing higher-perturbative orders, and when we pursue this objective, we inevitably face the presence of complicated multi-loop Feynman integrals. There are serious bottlenecks to compute them with classical tools: the time to explore novel technologies has arrived. In this work, we study the implementation of quantum algorithms to optimize the integrands of scattering amplitudes. Our approach relies on the manifestly causal Loop-Tree Duality (LTD), which re-casts the loop integrand into phase-space integrals and avoids spurious non-physical singularities. Then, we codify this information in such a way that a quantum computer can understand the problem, and build Hamiltonians whose ground state are directly related to the causal representation. Promising results for generic families of multi-loop topologies are presented.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational constraints on black holes with primary hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity: Stability and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We found that, unlike General Relativity, the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories provides black holes with primary hair, which are thermodynamically stable and compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope observations for M87* and Sgr A* black holes. We first investigate its thermodynamic properties by studying the influence of the primary hair on the thermodynamic quantities and the local stability, imposing severe constraints in the allowed range of the primary hair values. Then, we analyze the null geodesics near this black hole, demonstrating how the scalar hair influences the shadow diameter, finding that higher values of the primary hair lead to smaller shadow sizes. Additionally, we constrain the scalar hair using the observational data, revealing its sensitivity to the choice of other black hole parameters. To further probe the observational features of the scalar hair, we simulate face-on two-dimensional images of spherically infalling accretion disks, examining how the primary scalar hair affects the black hole's shadow. Finally, we impose all relevant constraints to identify black holes that are both stable and consistent with observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal Field Theory in a Minkowski setting is discussed in an embedding space approach, paying special attention to causality constraints for four-point amplitudes. The physics of dilatation and Lorentz boost is emphasized in specifying the non-compact Maximal Abelian subgroup (MASG) of $SO(d,2)$. Reduction of a Conformal Field Theory (CFT) four-point amplitudes as functions of cross ratios is shown to be equivalent to enforcing $H$ bi-invariance, i.e., $F(hgh')=F(g)$, with $g\in SO(d,2)$ and $H$ an appropriate subgroup. Causality is imposed by introducing appropriate semigroups. Causal zonal spherical functions are constructed, making contact with Minkowski conformal blocks introduced previously.</description>

      <title>On exceptional QP-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between two recent descriptions of tensor hierarchies - namely, infinity-enhanced Leibniz algebroids, given by Bonezzi &amp; Hohm and Lavau &amp; Palmkvist, the p-brane QP-manifolds constructed by Arvanitakis - is made precise. This is done by presenting a duality-covariant version of latter.
  The construction is based on the QP-manifold $T^\star[n]T[1]M \times \mathcal{H}[n]$, where $M$ corresponds to the internal manifold of a supergravity compactification and $\mathcal{H}[n]$ to a degree-shifted version of the infinity-enhanced Leibniz algebroid. Imposing that the canonical Q-structure on $T^\star[n] T[1] M$ is the derivative operator on $\mathcal{H}$ leads to a set of constraints. Solutions to these constraints correspond to $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS p-branes, suggesting that this is a new incarnation of a brane scan. Reduction w.r.t. to these constraints reproduces the known p-brane QP-manifolds. This is shown explicitly for the SL(3)$\times$SL(2)- and SL(5)-theories.
  Furthermore, this setting is used to speculate about exceptional 'extended spaces' and QP-manifolds associated to Leibniz algebras. A proposal is made to realise differential graded manifolds associated to Leibniz algebras as non-Poisson subspaces (i.e. not Poisson reductions) of QP-manifolds similar to the above. Two examples for this proposal are discussed: generalised fluxes (including the dilaton flux) of O(d,d) and the 3-bracket flux for the SL(5)-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the power spectra large enough to produce primordial black holes in models with multiple scalar fields. We present analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. We derive the criteria for an arbitrary number of fields that can lead to an exponential amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results to a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light'' scenario and show how the presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the two-field case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel classically integrable model is proposed. It is a deformation of the two-dimensional principal chiral model, embedded into a heterotic $\sigma$-model, by a particular heterotic gauge field. This is inspired by the bosonic part of the heterotic $\sigma$-model and its recent Hamiltonian formulation in terms of O$(d,d+n)$-generalised geometry by Hatsuda, Mori, Sasaki and Yata. Classical integrability is shown by construction of a Lax pair and a classical $\mathcal{R}$-matrix. Latter is almost of the canonical form with twist function and solves the classical Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimer tiling problem asks in how many ways can the edges of a graph be covered by dimers so that each site is covered once. In the special case of a planar graph, this problem has a solution in terms of a free fermionic field theory. We rediscover and explore an expression for the number of coverings of an arbitrary graph by arbitrary objects in terms of an interacting fermionic field theory first proposed by Samuel. Generalizations of the dimer tiling problem, which we call `dimer piling problems,' demand that each site be covered N times by indistinguishable dimers. Our field theory provides a solution of these problems in the large-N limit. We give a similar path integral representation for certain lattice coloring problems.</description>

      <title>On the universal exceptional structure of world-volume theories in string and M-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal structure of world-volume theories of half-BPS branes in string and M-theory in terms of exceptional generalised geometry is observed. Previous constructions are extended in two ways: from internal $d$-dimensional space to full 11- or 10-dimensional spacetimes, by coupling to the tensor hierarchy gauge fields, and from $E_{d(d)}$ with $d\leq 6$ to $E_{7(7)}$ and $E_{8(8)}$. This is done by a clarification of the role of the tensor hierarchy and its end in the context of brane world-volume theories. The exceptional structure of the gauged $\sigma$-model of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is provided as a new example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16166v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Schwinger model of a massless charged fermion coupled to an Abelian gauge field on a fixed de Sitter background. The theory admits an exact solution, first examined by Jayewardena, and can be analyzed efficiently using Euclidean methods. We calculate fully non-perturbative, gauge-invariant correlation functions of the electric field as well as the fermion and analyze these correlators in the late-time limit. We compare these results with the perturbative picture, for example by verifying that the one-loop contribution to the fermion two-point function, as predicted from the exact solution, matches the direct computation of the one-loop Feynman diagram. We demonstrate many features endemic of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, including the appearance of late-time logarithms, their resummation to de Sitter invariant expressions, and Boltzmann suppressed non-perturbative phenomena, with surprising late-time features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The known stringy non-relativistic (NR) limit of the universal NS-NS sector of supergravity has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the metric and the $B$-field. We demonstrate that in Double Field Theory (DFT) and generalised geometry these cancellations already happen at the level of the generalised metric, which is convergent in the limit $c \rightarrow \infty$, implying that the NR limit can be imposed before solving the strong constraint. We present the $c$-expansion of the generalised metric, which reproduces the Non-Riemannian formulation of DFT at the (finite) leading order, and the $c$-expansion of the generalised frame, which contains divergences. We also extend this approach to the non-Abelian gauge field of Heterotic DFT assuming a convergent expansion for the O$(D,D+n)$ generalised metric. From this proposal, we derive a novel $c$-expansion for the bosonic part of the heterotic supergravity which is, by construction, compatible with O$(D,D)$-symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study correlation functions on the Coulomb branch of planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang- Mills theory (SYM), and their relationship with integrability, the operator product expansion (OPE), the sum rule, the large charge expansion, and holography. First, we compute one-point functions of arbitrary scalar operators at weak coupling and derive a compact spin-chain representation. We next study the two-point functions of chiral primaries at one loop and find that the radius of convergence of OPE in position space is infinite. We estimate the asymptotic growth of the OPE data based on this finding. Finally, we propose a concrete nonperturbative formula that connects the correlation functions on the Coulomb branch with the correlation functions with large charge insertions at the conformal point and provide a holographic interpretation based on a large D3-brane in AdS. The formula extends the known connection between the large charge sector and the Coulomb branch for rank-1 theories to the large $N$ limit.</description>

Abstract: We propose a giant graviton expansion for Wilson line operator indices in general representations. The inserted line operators are specified by power sum symmetric polynomials $p_\lambda$ labeled by partitions $\lambda$. We interpret the partitions as the structure of fundamental string worldsheets wrapping around the temporal circle. The strings may or may not end on giant gravitons, and by summing the contributions from all brane configurations consistent with the specified partitions, we obtain the finite $N$ line operator index. The proposed formula is consistent with known results and passes highly non-trivial numerical tests.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we propose a generalized notion of distance between vacua in the theory of a scalar field $\phi$ with scalar potential $V(\phi)$ coupled to gravity. We propose the normalized tension of domain wall connecting different field values, with a varying normalization relative to a local energy scale, as the distance. We show this definition reproduces the usual moduli space distance for zero potential, as well as the $d\propto |\log \Lambda|$ behavior with the vacuum energy $\Lambda$ in the AdS case, previously proposed in the literature. In the case of large AdS we also obtain the expected exponent of mass versus distance in one particular case, when the mass of the light tower is $m\sim \sqrt \Lambda$ and there is a single extra dimension decompactifying. We also discuss the features and shortcomings of alternative but related proposals.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a Hamiltonian lattice formulation for 2+1D compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is derived. We analytically solve this theory and demonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known continuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the quantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates, the non-trivial properties of Wilson loops, and the mutual and self statistics of anyons. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based simulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Mellin amplitudes for $AdS_3 \times S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are holographic superconformal theories in all dimensions between two and six which allow arbitrary tree-level four-point functions to be fixed by basic consistency conditions. Although Mellin space is usually the most efficient setting for imposing these contraints, four-point functions in two dimensions have thus far been an exception due to their more intricate dependence on the conformal cross-ratios. In this paper, we introduce a simple fix which exploits the relation between a parity-odd conformal block in two dimensions and a parity-even conformal block in four dimensions. We then apply the resulting toolkit to a study of the paradigmatic holographic theory in two dimensions which is the D1-D5 CFT. For correlators involving Kaluza-Klein modes of the tensor multiplet, this analysis reproduces results which were previously obtained using hidden conformal symmetry. With four Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton multiplet, it yields new results including a compact formula for the correlators of all pairwise identical operators,</description>

      <title>Combinatorial summation of Feynman diagrams: Equation of state of the 2D SU(N) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet inflation in light of the PTA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in non-minimal coupling Gauss-Bonnet inflationary model in the presence of power-law potentials. We employ a two part coupling function to enhance primordial curvatures at small scales as well as satisfy Planck measurements at the CMB scale. Moreover, our model satisfies the swampland criteria. We find PBHs with different mass scales and demonstrate that PBHs with masses around $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot}$ can account for almost all of the dark matter in the universe. In addition, we investigate the implications of the reheating stage and show that the PBHs in our model are generated during the radiation-dominated era. Furthermore, we investigate the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs). More interestingly enough is that, for the specific cases $D_{\rm n}$ in our model, the GWs can be considered as a source of PTA signal. %evaluate the idea that the induced GWs propagating concurrently with the PBH production are the source of NANOGrav signal. Also, we conclude that the GWs energy density parameter at the nano-Hz regime can be parameterized as $\Omega_{\rm GW_0} (f) \sim f^{5-\gamma}$, where the obtained $\gamma$ is consistent with the PTA Observations.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Non-perturbative Regime of the Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator by Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of deep learning in physical sciences has recently boosted the ability of researchers to tackle physical systems where little or no analytical insight is available. Recently, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been introduced as one of the most promising tools to solve systems of differential equations guided by some physically grounded constraints. In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator. We investigate systems with real and imaginary frequency, laying the foundation for novel numerical methods to tackle problems emerging in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Massive two-loop four-point Feynman integrals at high energies with AsyInt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present analytic techniques for parametric integrations of massive two-loop four-point Feynman integrals at high energies, and their implementation in the toolbox AsyInt. In the high-energy region, the Feynman integrals involving external and internal massive particles, such as the top quark, Higgs and vector bosons, can be asymptotically expanded and directly calculated in the small-mass limit. With this approach, analytic results for higher-order terms in the expansion parameter and the dimensional regulator can be obtained with AsyInt. These results are important ingredients for the two-loop electroweak and QCD corrections for $2 \to 2$ scattering processes in the large transverse momenta region, which is relevant to both precision collider phenomenology and new physics searches at current and future high-energy colliders. In this paper, analytic results of representative planar and non-planar Feynman integrals are presented.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called dSC phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians for Periodic Free Fermion Chains with Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the half system entanglement Hamiltonians of the ground state of free fermion critical transverse field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of defects. In general, we see that these defects introduce non-local terms into the entanglement Hamiltonian with the largest being couplings across the defect that decay with distance. It is also shown that the entanglement Hamiltonian does know of the defect even if the defect is outside of the subsystem. We also discuss what happens when defects are on the boundaries of the subsystem, and in particular, we investigate the behavior as the bond leading into the subsystem is cut. Finally, we examine the non-local behavior of the antiperiodic defect and duality defect, both of which introduce zero modes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement content of kink excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum one-dimensional systems in their ordered phase admit kinks as elementary excitations above their symmetry-broken vacua. While the scattering properties of the kinks resemble those of quasiparticles, they have distinct locality features that are manifest in their entanglement content. In this work, we study the entanglement entropy of kink excitations. We first present detailed calculations for specific states of a spin-1/2 chain to highlight the salient features of these excitations. Second, we provide a field-theoretic framework based on the algebraic relations between the twist fields and the semilocal fields associated with the excitations, and we compute the R\'enyi entropies in this framework. We obtain universal predictions for the entropy difference between the excited states with a finite number of kinks and the symmetry-broken ground states, which do not depend on the microscopic details of the model in the limit of large regions. Finally, we discuss some consequences of the Kramers-Wannier duality, which relates the ordered and disordered phases of the Ising model, and we explain why, counterintuitively, no explicit relations between those phases are found at the level of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Spin-charge separation for paired Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions at finite density coupled to a complex pairing field assumed to obey scalar field theory with quartic self-repulsion. The bulk of our work develops the mathematics that elucidates the propagation of fermionic excitations in such systems as independent spin (boosts) and charge (fermion number) degrees of freedom. A necessary ingredient is the presence of broken $U(1)$ symmetry in the pairing field and decoupling of its density and phase. In the fermion sector, these elements give rise to an emergent spin-dependent gauge coupling which binds in-vacuum spin and charge into elementary fermions, while driving proliferation of unbound spin and charge for finite condensation in the pairing field. Notably, the onset of spin-charge separation is signaled by $\mathcal{P} \mathcal{T}$-symmetry breaking and decoupling of spin components under Lorentz transformations. Our investigation concludes with two theorems that identify generic features of spin-charge separation in such systems.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factors of Hadrons from CFT in Momentum Space and the Dilaton in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons at one-loop, in relation to their conformal field theory (CFT) description, within the framework of QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes at large momentum transfers. These form factors play an essential role in studying the quark and gluon angular momentum of the hadrons due to their relation to the Mellin moments of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) invariant amplitudes. Our analysis is performed using a diffeomorphism invariant approach, applying the formalism of the gravitational effective action and conformal symmetry in momentum space for the discussion of the quark and gluon contributions. The interpolating correlator in the hard scattering of any GFF is the non-Abelian $TJJ$ (stress-energy/gluon/gluon) 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, revealing an effective dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel due to the trace anomaly, in the form of a massless anomaly pole in the QCD hard scattering, constrained by a sum rule on its spectral density. We investigate the role of quarks, gauge-fixing and ghost contributions in the reconstruction of the hard scattering amplitude mediated by this interaction, performed in terms of its transverse traceless, longitudinal, and trace decomposition, as identified from CFT in momentum space ($CFT_p$). We present a convenient parameterization of the hard scattering amplitude relevant for future experimental investigations of the DVCS/GFF amplitudes at the Electron-Ion Collider at BNL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for realizing anyon condensation of topological orders within the string-net model by constructing a Hamiltonian that bridges the parent string-net model before and the child string-net model after anyon condensation. Our approach classifies all possible types of bosonic anyon condensation in any parent string-net model and identifies the basic degrees of freedom in the corresponding child models. Compared with the traditional UMTC perspective of topological orders, our method offers a finer categorical description of anyon condensation at the microscopic level. We also explicitly represent relevant UMTC categorical entities characterizing anyon condensation through our model-based physical quantities, providing practical algorithms for calculating these categorical data.</description>
