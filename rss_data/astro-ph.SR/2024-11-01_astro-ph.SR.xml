      <title>Polarization position angle standard stars: a reassessment of $\theta$ and its variability for seventeen stars based on a decade of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of polarization position angle ($\theta$) standards made from 2014 to 2023 with the High Precision Polarimetric Instrument (HIPPI) and other HIPPI-class polarimeters in both hemispheres are used to investigate their variability. Multi-band data were first used to thoroughly recalibrate the instrument performance by bench-marking against carefully selected literature data. A novel Co-ordinate Difference Matrix (CDM) approach - which combines pairs of points - was then used to amalgamate monochromatic ($g^\prime$ band) observations from many observing runs and re-determine $\theta$ for 17 standard stars. The CDM algorithm was then integrated into a fitting routine and used to establish the impact of stellar variability on the measured position angle scatter. The approach yields variability detections for stars on long time scales that appear stable over short runs. The best position angle standards are $\ell$ Car, $o$ Sco, HD 154445, HD 161056 and $\iota^1$ Sco which are stable to $\leq$ 0.123$^\circ$. Position angle variability of 0.27-0.82$^\circ$, significant at the 3-$\sigma$ level, is found for 5 standards, including the Luminous Blue Variable HD 160529 and all but one of the other B/A-type supergiants (HD 80558, HD 111613, HD 183143 and 55 Cyg), most of which also appear likely to be variable in polarization magnitude ($p$) - there is no preferred orientation for the polarization in these objects, which are all classified as $\alpha$ Cygni variables. Despite this we make six key recommendations for observers - relating to data acquisition, processing and reporting - that will allow them to use these standards to achieve $&lt;$ 0.1$^\circ$ precision in the telescope position angle with similar instrumentation, and allow data sets to be combined more accurately.</description>

      <title>Origin of line broadening in fading granule: influence of small-scale turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quiet region of the solar photosphere, turbulent convective motions of the granular flows naturally drive the subgranular-scale flows. However, evaluating such small-scale velocities is challenging because of the limited instrumental resolution. Our previous study, Ishikawa et al. (2020), found line broadening events during fading process of granules; however, their physical mechanism has remained unclear. In the present study, we observed the fading granules with the Hinode-SOT/SP and performed spectral line inversions. Moreover, we investigated broadening events of synthesized spectra in fading granules reproduced by the MURaM simulation. Our results demonstrated that the small-scale turbulent motions are excited in the fading process and such turbulent flows contribute to line broadening. The spectral line widths can be potential tracers of the photospheric turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Photometry and Habitable Zones of Over 2700 Planet-Hosting Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing discovery of exoplanets has sparked significant interest in finding suitable worlds that could potentially support life. Stellar ultraviolet (UV; 100-3000 \AA) radiation may play a crucial role in determining the habitability of their planets. In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis of the UV photometry of over 2700 host stars with confirmed planets, using observational data from the GALEX and Swift UVOT missions. We performed aperture photometry on single-exposure images, and provided photometric catalogs that can be used to explore a wide range of scientific questions, such as stellar UV activity and planet habitability. By calculating the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UV habitable zone (UHZ), we found that fewer than 100 exoplanets fall within both of these zones, with the majority being gas giants. We also examined stellar activity based on their far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) emissions. We found the FUV$-$NUV color more effectively represents stellar activity compared to the $R^{\prime}_{\rm FUV}$ and $R^{\prime}_{\rm NUV}$ indices. The Sun's low FUV emission and moderate NUV emission highlight its uniqueness among (solar-like) stars.</description>

      <title>Seismic differences between solar magnetic cycles 23 and 24 for low-degree modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar magnetic activity follows regular cycles of about 11 years with an inversion of polarity in the poles every 22 years. This changing surface magnetism impacts the properties of the acoustic modes. The acoustic mode frequency shifts are a good proxy of the magnetic cycle. In this Letter we investigate solar magnetic activity cycles 23 and 24 through the evolution of the frequency shifts of low-degree modes (l= 0, 1, and 2) in three frequency bands. These bands probe properties between 74 and 1575 km beneath the surface. The analysis was carried out using observations from the space instrument Global Oscillations at Low Frequency and the ground-based Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network and Global Oscillation Network Group. The frequency shifts of radial modes suggest that changes in the magnetic field amplitude and configuration likely occur near the Sun's surface rather than near its core. The maximum shifts of solar cycle 24 occurred earlier at mid and high latitudes (relative to the equator) and about 1550 km beneath the photosphere. At this depth but near the equator, this maximum aligns with the surface activity but has a stronger magnitude. At around 74 km deep, the behaviour near the equator mirrors the behaviour at the surface, while at higher latitudes, it matches the strength of cycle 23.</description>

      <title>Abrupt Periodic Pulsation Resumptions in Deneb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deneb (alpha Cygni) is a bright (V magnitude 1.25) blue-white supergiant (spectral type A2 Ia) which shows variability in both radial velocity and photometric measurements. H. Abt reviewed radial velocity measurements by Paddock (1935) using the Lick observatory 36-inch telescope spectrograph during 1927-1935. Abt noticed resumptions of pulsations with a dominant quasi-period of around 12 days that occur at intervals of around 70 days, and damp out after a few cycles. These resumptions appear to happen at arbitrary phase. Perhaps another event like this was captured in a shorter series of radial velocity measurements by Abt in 1956. We examined subsequent radial velocity and photometric data available in the literature, along with photometric measurements by the TESS spacecraft and V-magnitude observations by AAVSO observers. We find some evidence for periodic resumptions of larger-amplitude pulsations in these data. However, longer contiguous data sets combined with more frequent sampling are needed to confirm this periodicity in resumption of pulsations, and to help answer many more questions about Deneb and the alpha Cygni variables.</description>

      <title>Deneb and the alpha Cygni Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deneb, the prototype alpha Cygni variable, is a blue-white supergiant that shows irregular variability with quasi-period around 12 days in brightness and radial velocity. Abt et al. (2023) found that larger amplitude 12-day variations appear to resume abruptly and at an arbitrary phase and damp out after several cycles, with an interval of around 70 days between these resumptions. Here we make use of an 8.6-year photometric data set for Deneb from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) to better characterize this behavior. We find that the interval between pulsation resumptions is not exact, with the most common intervals between 100 and 120 days. Sometimes one or more intervals are skipped. We also examine AAVSO and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves for alpha Cyg variables Rigel, Saiph, and Alnilam in Orion, Aludra in Canis Major, and 6 Cas to compare with the behavior of alpha Cyg. Except for 6 Cas, the time series are too short, or the observations too infrequent to draw any conclusions about similarities between the behavior of these stars and alpha Cyg. We also summarize results of evolution and pulsation modeling for Deneb and alpha Cyg variables from the literature. The alpha Cyg variables may not be a homogenous group with a common mechanism for their variability. It has not been determined whether they are on the first crossing of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram toward the red supergiant phase or are on their second crossing after having been red supergiants. Future plans include examining BRITE Constellation data for Deneb, processing SMEI data for other bright alpha Cyg variables, and comparing 6 Cas light curves from AAVSO and TESS data taken concurrently.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Solar Orbiter Observations of Interplanetary Shocks in Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary shocks are fundamental constituents of the heliosphere, where they form as a result of solar activity. We use previously unavailable measurements of interplanetary shocks in the inner heliosphere provided by Solar Orbiter, and present a survey of the first 100 shocks observed in situ at different heliocentric distances during the rising phase of solar cycle 25. The fundamental shock parameters (shock normals, shock normal angles, shock speeds, compression ratios, Mach numbers) have been estimated and studied as a function of heliocentric distance, revealing a rich scenario of configurations. Comparison with large surveys of shocks at 1~au show that shocks in the quasi-parallel regime and with high speed are more commonly observed in the inner heliosphere. The wave environment of the shocks has also been addressed, with about 50\% of the events exhibiting clear shock-induced upstream fluctuations. We characterize energetic particle responses to the passage of IP shocks at different energies, often revealing complex features arising from the interaction between IP shocks and pre-existing fluctuations, including solar wind structures being processed upon shock crossing. Finally, we give details and guidance on the access use of the present survey, available on the EU-project ``solar energetic particle analysis platform for the inner heliosphere'' (SERPENTINE) website. The algorithm used to identify shocks in large datasets, now publicly available, is also described.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band Follow-up. I. -Carbon-Chain Chemistry of Intermediate-Mass Protostars-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} &lt; m_* &lt;8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Deep Search for a scattered light dust halo around Vega with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a provisory scattered light detection of the Vega debris disk using deep Hubble Space Telescope coronagraphy (PID 16666). At only 7.7 parsecs, Vega is immensely important in debris disk studies both for its prominence and also because it allows the highest physical resolution among all debris systems relative to temperature zones around the star. We employ the STIS coronagraph's widest wedge position and classical Reference Differential Imaging to achieve among the lowest surface brightness sensitivities to date ($\sim 4\,\mu Jy/arcsec^{2}$) at wide separations using 32 orbits in Cycle 29. We detect a halo extending from the inner edge of our effective inner working angle at $10^{\prime\prime}.5$ out to the photon noise floor at $30^{\prime\prime}$ (80 - 230 au). The face-on orientation of the system and the lack of a perfectly color-matched PSF star have provided significant challenges to the reductions, particularly regarding artifacts from the imperfect color matching. However, we find that a halo of small dust grains provides the best explanation for the observed signal. Unlike Fomalhaut (a close twin to Vega in luminosity, distance, and age), there is no clear distinction in scattered light between the parent planetesimal belt observed with ALMA and the extended dust halo. These HST observations complement JWST GTO Cycle 1 observations of the system with NIRCam and MIRI.</description>

      <title>Classifying binary black holes from Population III stars with the Einstein Telescope: A machine-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers at redshifts up to $z\sim 100$. However, an unequivocal determination of the origin of high-redshift sources will remain uncertain because of the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and poor estimate of their luminosity distance. This study proposes a machine-learning approach to infer the origins of high-redshift BBHs. We specifically differentiate those arising from Population III (Pop. III) stars, which probably are the first progenitors of star-born BBH mergers in the Universe, and those originated from Population I-II (Pop. I-II) stars. We considered a wide range of models that encompass the current uncertainties on Pop. III BBH mergers. We then estimated the parameter errors of the detected sources with ET using the Fisher information-matrix formalism, followed by a classification using XGBoost, which is a machine-learning algorithm based on decision trees. For a set of mock observed BBHs, we provide the probability that they belong to the Pop. III class while considering the parameter errors of each source. In our fiducial model, we accurately identify $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the detected BBHs that originate from Pop. III stars with a precision $&gt;90\%$. Our study demonstrates that machine-learning enables us to achieve some pivotal aspects of the ET science case by exploring the origin of individual high-redshift GW observations. We set the basis for further studies, which will integrate additional simulated populations and account for further uncertainties in the population modeling.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for modeling the temporal and spectral evolution of kilonova systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and frequency-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and frequency-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.</description>
