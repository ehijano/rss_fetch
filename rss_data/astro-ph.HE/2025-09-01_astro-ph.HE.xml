      <title>Fates of Rotating Supergiants from Stellar Mergers and the Landscape of Transients upon Core-collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a grid of rotating supergiant models from post-main sequence binary merger products, constructed by the MESA stellar evolution code. We focus on the evolution of these stars until core-collapse, in addition to their rotation, which could influence their mass loss and explosion phenomenology. We find that (i) as in previous studies, larger mass gain by merger favors the production of blue supergiants (BSGs) over red supergiants, and (ii) merger products that end as BSGs at core collapse have rotating outer envelopes, with lower-mass BSGs having faster envelope rotation due to less wind mass loss. We model the expected transients from these BSGs upon core-collapse, considering cases where the neutrino-driven explosion is successful and unsuccessful. The successful explosions result in supernovae (SNe) with long-rising light curves of morphology similar to SN 1987A. Failed explosions of these BSGs result in envelope fallback of $\sim (0.1$- several) $~M_\odot$ over $10^3$-$10^5$ seconds that power strong ($10^{51}$-$10^{53}$ erg) accretion-driven outflows in winds and possibly jets, with relativistic jets (if formed) generally capable of breaking out of the BSG envelope. Our modeling points to these merger-origin BSGs as viable progenitors for SN 1987A-like SNe, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, and some of the fast luminous transients found in high-cadence optical surveys.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization in radio-quiet AGN: Insights from the wedge corona model using Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present novel calculations of X-ray polarization from radio-quiet and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the Monte Carlo code MONK, which includes all general and special relativity effects. Our geometric model, referred to as the ``wedge corona'', features a homogeneous cloud of electrons characterized by an aspect ratio of h/r and a radius that extends down to the innermost stable circular orbit around the central black hole (BH). Adopting the physical parameters of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 as a baseline, we investigated various geometric and physical configurations of the BH-corona-accretion disk (AD) system, such as the coronal opening angle, temperature, optical depth, BH spin, and the inner radius of the disk. Finally, we compared our calculations with results from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) for NGC 4151, the only radio-quiet and unobscured AGN with significant polarization detected by IXPE, to constrain the system's geometric parameters within the framework of the wedge corona model.</description>

      <title>A re-identification of six Candidate Gravitationally Lensed Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing effect of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) holds significant and diverse applications in the field of astronomy. Nevertheless, the identification of millilensing events in GRBs presents substantial challenges. We re-evaluate the gravitational lensing candidacy of six previously proposed GRBs (GRB 081122A, GRB 081126A, GRB 090717A, GRB 110517B, GRB 200716C, and GRB 210812A) using a comprehensive set of temporal and spectral diagnostics. These include $\chi^2$ light-curve similarity tests, photon-count-based hardness ratio ($HR_{count}$) comparisons, $T_{90}$ duration measurements, spectral lag, Norris pulse-shape fitting, and both time-resolved and time-integrated spectral analyses. We propose an evaluation framework, any single test that reveals a statistically significant inconsistency between the two pulses is sufficient to reject the lensing hypothesis for that burst.Although certain diagnostics, such as $T_{90}$ and parametric model fits, have known limitations, they are applied and interpreted in conjunction with the more robust, model-independent $\chi^2$ and $HR_{count}$ tests. For all six GRBs, at least one diagnostic shows a significant discrepancy, leading us to conclude that none are consistent with a gravitational lensing interpretation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 17 New GeV Blazar Candidates through Spatial Cross-Matching between Roma-BZCAT and 4FGL-Xiang-DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data and resources from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), we constructed two high-precision catalogs: the updated 4FGL-Xiang-DR2 (DR2) and a supplementary version of the fifth edition of Roma-BZCAT (5BZCAT\_err), both featuring refined positional uncertainties. We performed a spatial cross-identification between the two catalogs and developed a systematic three-step analytical pipeline: (1) efficient retrieval of positional uncertainties and multi-wavelength fluxes from 5BZCAT\_err, (2) calculation of spatial association probabilities with DR2, and (3) statistical modeling of multi-band fluxes, using the Box--Cox transformation and a truncated normal distribution. Through this process, we identified 17 new blazar candidates. Fermi-LAT analysis reveals that, except for J1043.7+5323, which exhibits significant flux variability above 100 MeV, the remaining sources display stable fluxes, without apparent spatial extension or spectral curvature. Multi-wavelength flux modeling shows that 15 of the 17 sources fall within the 2$\sigma$ confidence interval of the distribution model, demonstrating strong statistical consistency with known blazar samples. As Fermi-LAT data continues to accumulate, the remaining two sources are expected to converge toward the high-confidence region, providing further support for the common-source hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Identifying massive black hole binaries via light curve variability in optical time-domain surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) often display periodic variations in their emitted radiation, providing a distinctive signature for their identification. In this work, we explore the MBHBs identification via optical variability studies by simulating the observations of the LSST survey. To this end, we generate a population of MBHBs using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model, focusing on systems with observed orbital periods $\leq$ 5 years. This ensures that at least two complete cycles of emission can be observed within the 10-year mission of LSST. To construct mock optical light curves, we first calculate the MBHB average magnitudes in each LSST filter by constructing a self-consistent SED that accounts for the binary accretion history and the emission from a circumbinary disc and mini-discs. We then add variability modulations by using six 3D hydrodynamic simulations of accreting MBHBs with different eccentricities and mass ratios as templates. To make the light curves realistic, we mimic the LSST observation patterns and cadence, and we include stochastic variability and LSST photometric errors. Our results show from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$ MBHBs per square degree, with light curves that are potentially detectable by LSST. These systems are mainly low-redshift ($z\lesssim1.5$), massive ($\gtrsim10^{7}\, M_{\odot}$), equal-mass (${\sim} 0.8$), relatively eccentric (${\sim}0.6$), and with modulation periods of around $3.5$ years. Using periodogram analysis, we find that LSST variability studies have a higher success rate ($&gt;$50%) for systems with high eccentricities ($e&gt;$0.6). Additionally, at fixed eccentricity, detections tend to favour systems with more unequal mass ratios. The false alarm probability shows similar trends. Circular binaries systematically feature high values ($\gtrsim 10^{-1}$). Eccentric systems have low-FAP tails, down to $\sim10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Possible Coronal Geometry in the Hard and Soft State of Black Hole X-ray Binaries from MONK Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the coronal geometry in different states of black hole X-ray binaries is important for more accurate modeling of the system. However, it is difficult to distinguish different geometries by fitting the observed Comptonization spectra. In this work, we use the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code MONK to simulate the spectra for three widely proposed coronal geometries: sandwich, spherical, and lamppost, varying their optical depth and size (height). By fitting the simulated NuSTAR observations with the simplcut*kerrbb model, we infer the possible parameter space for the hard state and soft state of different coronal geometries. The influence of the disk inclination angle and black hole spin is discussed. We find that for the lamppost model the disk emission is always dominant, making it incompatible in the hard state. While the sandwich and spherical models can produce similar spectra in both the hard and soft states, the simulated IXPE polarimetric spectra show the potential to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Probing Picohertz Gravitational Waves with Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data. However, signatures of these low-frequency signals persist in the slow variation of pulsar timing parameters. In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the gamma-ray emission in the Cygnus region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cygnus region is a vast star-forming complex harbouring a population of powerful objects, including massive star clusters and associations, Wolf-Rayet stars, pulsars, and supernova remnants. The multi-wavelength picture is far from understood, in particular the recent LHAASO detection of multi-degree scale diffuse gamma-ray emission up to PeV energies. We aim to model the broadband gamma-ray data, discriminating plausible scenarios amongst all candidate accelerators. We consider in particular relic hadronic emission from a supernova remnant expanding in a low-density environment and inverse Compton emission from stellar-wind termination shocks in the Cygnus OB2 stellar association. We first estimate the maximum particle energy from a 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the supernova remnant scenario. The transport equation is then solved numerically to determine the radial distribution of non-thermal protons and electrons. In order to compute synthetic gamma-ray spectra and emission maps, we develop a 3D model of the gas distribution. This includes, firstly, a HI component with a low-density superbubble around Cygnus OB2 and, secondly, molecular clouds lying at the edge of the superbubble and in the foreground. We find that a powerful, ~50 kyr-old supernova remnant can account for both the morphology and spectrum from 10 TeV-PeV. At PeV energies, the microquasar Cygnus X-3 and diffuse Galactic cosmic rays might also contribute to the flux. Below about 10 TeV, hadronic models are incompatible with the expected existence of a superbubble centred on Cygnus OB2. Instead, the spectrum is well fitted with inverse Compton emission from electrons accelerated at stellar-wind termination shocks in Cygnus OB2 in line with existing multi-wavelength limits.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray energy spectra derived from KASCADE-Grande data using post-LHC hadronic interaction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KASCADE-Grande was dedicated to measuring the energy spectrum and mass composition of cosmic rays in the energy range of 10 PeV to 1 EeV. We observed a knee-like structure in the heavy mass component at around 100 PeV and an ankle-like structure in the light component. In this contribution, we present updated energy spectra based on shower size measurements, using the post-LHC hadronic models QGSJet-II-04, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL 2.3d, including accounting for shower-to-shower fluctuations. In addition, the newly released EPOS-LHC-R model is tested for the first time with KASCADE-Grande. We will compare and discuss the results obtained using the different hadronic interaction models.</description>

      <title>The cosmic-ray spectrum in the PeV to EeV energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays around the so-called knee in the spectrum at around PeV primary energy are generally galactic in origin. Observations on the form of their energy spectrum and their mass composition are fundamental tools to understand the origin, acceleration and propagation mechanism of high-energy cosmic rays. In addition, it is required to find signatures to clarify the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources, which are believed to be responsible for the highest-energy cosmic rays above EeV. This brief review focuses on recent experimental results around the knee of the all-particle energy spectrum and composition in the energy range of the knee up to EeV energies.</description>

      <title>Road map for the tuning of hadronic interaction models with accelerator-based and astroparticle data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy and astroparticle physics, event generators play an essential role, even in the simplest data analyses. As analysis techniques become more sophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of the observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical processes occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo framework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum transfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic collision. Phenomenological models inspired by Quantum Chromodynamics used for these phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase space. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable experimental data. Until now, event generators have primarily been developed and tuned based on data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators. However, in many cases they have been found to not satisfactorily describe data from astroparticle experiments, which provide sensitivity especially to hadrons produced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass energies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so far. In this report, we address the complementarity of these two sets of data and present a road map for exploiting, for the first time, their complementarity by enabling a unified tuning of event generators with accelerator-based and astroparticle data.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in protogalactic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z &gt; 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.</description>

Abstract: We present version 2.1 of the public code {\sc precession}, a Python module for studying the post-Newtonian dynamics of precessing black hole binaries. In this release, we extend the code to handle eccentric orbits. This extension leverages the existing numerical infrastructure wherever possible, introducing a semi-automatic method to adapt circular-orbit functions to the eccentric case via a Python decorator. Additional new features include orbit- and precession-averaged evolutionary equations for the eccentricity, as well as revised expressions to convert between post-Newtonian separation and gravitational-wave emission frequency.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Variance in Anisotropy Searches at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) with angular correlations consistent with the Hellings-Downs curve. Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of this GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\% for astrophysical sources, but suppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave detectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements of a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which induces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB. We demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains robust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of isotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly discriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate that the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with the number of pulsars $\ell_{\rm max} \sim N_p$.</description>

      <title>Intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in a dense dark-matter environment: Effects of the initial dark-matter distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>The fate of rotating massive stars across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.</description>

      <title>The degeneracy between microlensing wave effect and precession in strongly lensed gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microlensing induced by the stellar field within a strong lensing galaxy can introduce fluctuations in the waveforms of strongly-lensed gravitational waves.When fitting these signals with templates that do not account for microlensing,possible degeneracies can lead to false evidence of certain intrinsic parameters,resulting in a misinterpretation of the properties of the underlying system.For example,the wave effect of microlensing may mimic spin precessions,as both effects generically induce periodic waveform modulations.Although previous studies suggest that lensing-induced modulations can be distinguished from precession using parameter estimation under a geometric-optic approximation,it does not directly apply for lensed image through stellar fields due to large number of stars involved an wave-optic effects.This study aims to evaluate the degree of degeneracy between the stellar-field microlensing and spin precession,investigating whether microlensing leads false evidence of precession.In other words,to what extent observed SLGWs are identified with false evidence of precession.The main findings are as follows.First,assuming O5 sensitivity and parallel spins for the underlying binary black holes,microlensing-induced false evidence of precession is generally weak(15% of the events show significant evidence,30% if the signal-to-noise ratio doubles).Second,for highly magnified events,about 72% of the population show significant evidence of precession,which could serve as an identification criterion for microlensing.This implies the possibility of strong lensing for the recent event GW231123,which is in the mass gap and also shows evidence of precession.Finally,a moderate to strong positive correlation exists between microlensing strength and precession evidence,more pronounced in Type II SLGWs.This suggests that stronger precession evidence may imply a stronger microlensing effect.</description>

      <title>Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole Spacetimes in Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</description>

Abstract: We summarize how a renormalization-group (RG)-consistent treatment removes well-known artifacts in NJL-model descriptions of color-superconducting quark matter. We introduce two RG-consistent schemes, "minimal" and "massless", and present analytic solutions for the diquark gap at $T=0$ and for the phase boundary $T_c(\mu)$ in symmetric massless matter, representing the high-density limit of the model. We compare the pairing gaps, phase diagram, and speed of sound with results obtained using conventional regularization.</description>

      <title>Gaia's promise to detect compact-object binaries: where we stand with the third data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With its third data release (DR3), Gaia begins unveiling dormant candidate compact object (CO) binaries with luminous companion (LC) as predicted by several past theoretical studies. To date, 3 black hole (BH), 21 neutron star (NS), and ~3200 white dwarf (WD) candidates have been identified with LCs in detached orbits using astrometry. We adopt an observationally motivated sampling scheme for the star formation history of the Milky Way, and initial zero-age main-sequence binary properties, incorporate all relevant binary interaction processes during evolution to obtain a realistic present-day intrinsic population of CO--LC binaries. We apply Gaia's selection criteria to identify the CO--LC binaries detectable using the observational cuts applicable for DR3 as well as its end-of-mission (EOM). We find that under the DR3 selection cuts, our detectable population includes no BH--LCs, approximately 10-40 NS--LCs, and around ~4300 WD--LCs. In contrast, by EOM, the expected numbers increase to 30-300 BH--LCs, 1500-5000 NS--LCs, and ~10^5-10^6 WD--LC binaries, primarily because of the significantly longer baseline of observation.</description>

Abstract: We describe a new method to incorporate thermonuclear heating in the envelope of accreting neutron star into long term simulations of their thermal evolution. We obtain boundary conditions for the heat exchange between the envelope and the crust based on stationary models which include nuclear burning and validate these values comparing to the results of the time-dependent code \texttt{MESA}. These simple boundary conditions allow us to explore a large parameter space. We quantify the amount of heat flowing from the envelope into the crust, or viceversa, depending on the mass accretion rate, outburst duration and duty cycle, and especially crust/core physical parameters such as impurities, crustal heating, and neutrino cooling rate.</description>

      <title>Gravity versus astrophysics in black hole images and photon rings: Equatorial emissions and spherically symmetric space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EHT collaboration released in 2019 the first horizon-scale images of a black hole accretion flow, opening a novel route for plasma physics comprehension and gravitational tests. Although the present unresolved images deeply depend on the astrophysical properties of the accreted matter, GR predicts that they contain highly lensed observables, the "photon rings", embodying the effects of strong-field gravity. Focusing on the supermassive black hole M87* and adopting a geometrically thin, equatorial disc as a phenomenological configuration for the accreting matter, our goal is to study the degeneracy of spacetime curvature and of physically-motivated emission processes on EHT-like images observed at 230 and 345 GHz. In a parametric framework, we simulate adaptively ray-traced images using GYOTO in various spherically-symmetric spacetime geometries, for a comprehensive class of disc velocities and realistic synchrotron emission profiles. We then extract the width and the peak position of 1D intensity cross sections on the direct image and the first photon ring. We show that, among the investigated quantities, the most appropriate observables to probe the geometry are the peak positions of the first photon ring. Small geometric deviations can be unequivocally detected, regardless of the motion of the disc, ranging from a Keplerian to a radially infalling one, if the black hole mass-to-distance estimate is accurate up to around 2%; the current uncertainty of 11% being sufficient just to access extreme deviations. The equatorial set-up of this paper, favoured by present EHT observations of M87*, is adapted to model future measurements at higher observing frequencies, where absorption effects are negligible, and with higher resolution, indispensable to resolve the photon rings. Additional work is needed to investigate if our conclusions hold for more realistic disc configurations.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal emission in the central starburst region of M82</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse non-thermal (NT) emission from the central starburst (CSB) of M82 has been measured at radio, X-ray and gamma-ray energies. Far-infrared (FIR), radio, and X-ray emission maps are mutually consistent, with radio and X-ray emissions spectrally similar - suggesting the latter to be Compton/FIR radiation. We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements, which - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest, most extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT radio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR). Key features of our models are the identification of the &gt;50 GeV emission as pionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum. This enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and secondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR and magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR, and use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB region - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody. Our SED modeling indicates that 1) the &gt;10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2) the 0.1 &lt; E/GeV &lt; 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight (and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the &lt;0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic, and 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at comparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and a curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp spectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200 1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the magnetic field is B = 120 uG. The derived CR and B energy densities are in equipartition.</description>

      <title>The most distant $\gamma$-ray flare to date: a multiwavelength campaign on the $z = 4.715$ blazar GB6 B1428+4217</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In November 2023, the Fermi Large Area Telescope detected a $\gamma$-ray flare from the high-redshift blazar GB6 B1428+4217 ($z=4.715$). We initiated a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign involving Swift, NuSTAR, the Sierra Nevada and Perkins Observatories, and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. This source, also known as 5BZQ J1430+4204, has shown an anomalous soft X-ray spectrum in previous observations, including possible ionized absorption features or signatures of bulk Comptonization of thermal electrons, which are also detected during the flaring episode. Simultaneous optical data revealed a polarization fraction of ${\sim}8$\% in the R band, confirming that synchrotron emission dominated over thermal emission from the accretion disk. The hard X-ray flux was enhanced during the flare. Modeling of the broadband spectral energy distribution suggests that the high-energy component is dominated by Compton scattering by external seed photons from the accretion disk. The origin of the flare is consistent with the injection of a hard-spectrum electron population in the emission region. With a $\gamma$-ray luminosity among the top 5% of flaring events, GB6 B1428+4217 exemplifies a prototypical MeV blazar. Its Compton-dominated SED and extreme luminosity are in line with expectations from the blazar sequence. High-redshift flares like this are critical for understanding jet physics in the early Universe and may improve detection prospects with future missions such as COSI.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the dispersion measure of Fast Radio Burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is sensitive to the electron distribution in the Universe, making it a promising probe of cosmology and astrophysical processes such as baryonic feedback. However, cosmological analyses of FRBs require knowledge of the contribution to the observed DM coming from the FRB host. The size and distribution of this contribution is still uncertain, thus significantly limiting current cosmological FRB analyses. In this study, we extend the baryonification (BCM) approach to derive a physically-motivated, analytic model for predicting the host contribution to FRB DMs. By focusing on the statistical properties of FRB host DMs, we find that our simple model is able to reproduce the probability distribution function (PDF) of host halo DMs measured from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations, as well as their mass- and redshift dependence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model allows for self-consistent predictions of the host DM PDF and the matter power spectrum suppression due to baryonic effects, as observed in these simulations, making it promising for modelling host-DM-related systematics in FRB analyses. In general, we find that the shape of the host DM PDF is determined by the interplay between the FRB and gas distributions in halos. Our findings indicate that more compact FRB profiles require shallower gas profiles (and vice versa) in order to match the observed DM distributions in hydrodynamic simulations. Furthermore, the analytic model presented here shows that the shape of the host DM PDF is highly sensitive to the parameters of the BCM. This suggests that this observable could be used as an interesting test bed for baryonic processes, complementing other probes due to its sensitivity to feedback on galactic scales. We further discuss the main limitations of our analysis, and point out potential avenues for future work.</description>

Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from supersymmetric gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify the dynamics of massive vector (Proca) fields in Schwarzschild spacetime with supersymmetric gauge theories through the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal mode (SW/QNM) duality. By mapping Proca perturbations-specifically monopole and odd-parity modes governed by confluent Heun equations-to the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve, we establish a gauge-gravity correspondence. Leveraging instanton counting, we analytically compute QNM and quasi-bound state frequencies to high precision, resolving spectral properties non-perturbatively. Our results align with numerical benchmarks while extending the SW framework beyond scalar fields.</description>

      <title>The Science of the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is the European project for a gravitational-wave (GW) observatory of third-generation. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of its science objectives, providing state-of-the-art predictions for the capabilities of ET in both geometries currently under consideration, a single-site triangular configuration or two L-shaped detectors. We discuss the impact that ET will have on domains as broad and diverse as fundamental physics, cosmology, early Universe, astrophysics of compact objects, physics of matter in extreme conditions, and dynamics of stellar collapse. We discuss how the study of extreme astrophysical events will be enhanced by multi-messenger observations. We highlight the ET synergies with ground-based and space-borne GW observatories, including multi-band investigations of the same sources, improved parameter estimation, and complementary information on astrophysical or cosmological mechanisms obtained combining observations from different frequency bands. We present advancements in waveform modeling dedicated to third-generation observatories, along with open tools developed within the ET Collaboration for assessing the scientific potentials of different detector configurations. We finally discuss the data analysis challenges posed by third-generation observatories, which will enable access to large populations of sources and provide unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing Fermionic Dark Matter in Scotogenic Model with Low Reheating Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.</description>
