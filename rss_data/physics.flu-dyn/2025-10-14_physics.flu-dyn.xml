      <title>From deep to shallow water 2D wave turbulence: Emergence of soliton gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on 2D random water wave propagation in a large wave tank are analyzed when the effect of dispersion changes. A stereoscopic profilometry technique is used to measure the water surface displacement resolved in both time and space over a significant fraction of the wave tank. The wave regimes are characterized by analyzing the space-time spectral statistical properties of the wave field. At a given, finite, water depth, the effect of dispersion can be varied by tuning the peak frequency of the wave generation. In shallow water conditions, the waves are only weakly dispersive and this enables the propagation of solitons. {In these conditions random wave forcing produces soliton gases}. In deep water conditions, the waves are dispersive and for wideband spectra, one observes the development of weak turbulence. A transition between these regimes is observed when changing the peak forcing frequency (dispersion) and the wave amplitude (nonlinearity), with a clear threshold between states with solitons and soliton-less states. The development of a soliton gas is associated with a strong change of the wave spectrum as well as a significant evolution of the distribution of the water elevation. We also observed a strong effect of the finite size of the tank due to the peculiar reflection laws of line solitons.</description>

      <title>A feasibility study of passive ventilation via origami-driven stack effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative ventilation system, which leverages an origami-inspired structure to improve and regulate natural airflow driven by the stack effect, with applications in underground mines and buildings. The proposed system retrofits chimneys and/or exhaust risers with expandable origami units that dynamically modulate their geometric features (height and vent area) to control buoyancy-driven ventilation independent of external wind or solar conditions. The efficacy of the proposed concept is evaluated using a three-dimensional computational model that focuses on how the geometric design of the deployable stack and varying atmospheric conditions affect the volumetric airflow through the stack in both its fully expanded and contracted states. The results show that the ventilation rate increases by up to 25\% with each doubling of the height of the origami stack. % These findings highlight the potential of leveraging origami-inspired structures for adaptable and controllable energy-efficient ventilation, which is particularly beneficial in energy-intensive applications and/or remote, off-grid locations.</description>

      <title>Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering: influences of intermolecular potentials and chirp rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirped coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) is a flow diagnostic technique that offers high signal-to-noise ratios and nanosecond temporal resolution. To extract information of dilute gas flow, experimental spectra must be compared with theoretical predictions derived from the Boltzmann equation. In this work, we develop a MATLAB code that deterministically solves the Boltzmann equation to compute CRBS spectra, enabling each line shape to be obtained in about one minute. We find that the CRBS spectrum is highly sensitive to the intermolecular potential, and that rapid chirping generates fine ripples around the Rayleigh peak along with spectral asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Adhesive forces in droplet kinetic friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic frictional forces resisting droplet motion often appear to be separate to surface wettability and adhesive forces. Here we show that such friction arises from a simple combination of the contact angle hysteresis and adhesive force. We show theoretically, and confirm using tilt angle experiments of droplets on liquid-like surfaces, the dependence of the coefficient of droplet-on-solid kinetic friction on system parameters. We also show that a molecular kinetic-type model can describe the observed non-linear velocity-force relationship. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the relationship between droplet-on-solid friction, and wettability and liquid adhesion.</description>

      <title>Spectral spacetime-geometry of Womersley flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Womersley solution for pulsatile viscous flow in a circular tube and reconstruct its full time-domain geometry from first principles. By combining harmonic decomposition with exact Bessel solutions, we derive a unified spectral spacetime analytical solution in which the instantaneous relationship between pressure gradient and velocity can be visualized as a loop in phase space. The enclosed loop area is shown to equal the mean hydraulic power per cycle, establishing an exact geometric-energetic identity that holds for arbitrary Womersley number and harmonic composition. We further show that higher harmonic content and increasing Womersley number induce topological transitions in these loops, producing cusps, self-intersections, and curvature hot spots that correspond to inertial-viscous phase dispersion. This framework provides a rigorous baseline for interpreting arterial pressure-flow loops, connecting frequency-domain impedance analysis to measurable time-domain geometry.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Coulomb fissions of drops on lubricated surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged water drops are more widespread than commonly acknowledged. For example, raindrops typically carry charges of order Q ~ 1 pC, while routine pipetting in the laboratory produces drops with Q ~ 50 pC. Here, we show that such modest charging can spontaneously generate periodic Coulomb fissions for evaporating water drops on lubricated surfaces, with more than 60 successive cycles observed over 30 min. Interestingly, the underlying instability can be quantitatively predicted by two fissility thresholds: one marking the onset of drop elongation and another triggering fission. Each fission culminates with a fine liquid jet that disintegrates into 40-50 microdroplets, expelled within microseconds. The phenomenon spans an extraordinary range of length scales (from millimetres to microns) and time scales (hour to microseconds), with broad potential applications ranging from nanoscale fabrication to electrospray ionization.</description>

      <title>The significance of two-way coupling in two-dimensional, dusty turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of small-scale forcing of particles on the carrier two-dimensional turbulent flow has been shown [Pandey, Perlekar, and Mitra, Phys. Rev. E, 100, 013114 (2019)] to influence the spectral scaling properties of the carrier fluid. We investigate possible consequences of such two-way coupling in a turbulent suspension of inertial particles in one and two-point Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics. In particular, we find signatures of a possibly enhanced intermittency in the vorticity distributions. We characterize the changes in the (small-scale) geometry of the flow via the Okubo-Weiss parameter. Finally, we examine the scaling properties of the second-order (vorticity) structure functions and find a non-trivial form of scale-invariance at finite mass-loading. This suggests that a dual-scale forcing mechanism on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation may be an effective model to mimic the role of particle feedback in turbulence.</description>

      <title>A model for transport of soluble surfactants in two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel transport model for soluble surfactants in two-phase flows. In a two-phase flow, the soluble surfactants can adsorb/desorb from/into the bulk of any of the phases to the interface and can modify the interface properties. This results in sharp gradients in the surfactant concentration on the interface and also between the two phases in the bulk when there is selective adsorption/desorption, presenting a serious challenge for the numerical simulations.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational model for the transport of soluble surfactants that can model the adsorption and desorption processes accurately. The model is discretized using a central-difference scheme, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation that is crucial for the simulation of turbulent flows. The model is used with the ACDI diffuse-interface method (Jain, 2022), but can also be used with other algebraic-based interface-capturing methods. Furthermore, the provable strengths of the proposed model are: (a) the model maintains the positivity property of the surfactant concentration field, a physical realizability requirement for the simulation of surfactants, when the proposed criterion is satisfied, (b) the proposed model maintains discrete confinement of the interfacial and bulk surfactants and prevents artificial numerical diffusion of the surfactant between the interface and the bulk and between the two phases in the bulk.
  Finally, we present numerical simulations using the proposed model for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases and assess: the accuracy and robustness of the model, the validity of the positivity property of the scalar concentration field, and the confinement of the surfactant at the interface. We also study the effect of surfactants on an oscillating droplet and on a complex droplet/bubble-laden turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Analysis of bio-nanofluid flow over a stretching sheet with slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A viscous, incompressible, micropolar bio-nanofluid flowing across a stretching sheet in three dimensions while being driven to convect several slip boundaries in the presence of a magnetic field was studied. With the assistance of the relevant transformations, a mathematical model is presented. The finite difference method numerically solves the converted non-linear ordinary differential equations. A comprehensive assessment was conducted to examine the impact of governing parameters on dimensionless velocity, micro-rotation, temperature, nanoparticle volume fraction, microorganisms, and heat transfer rate. The findings of this investigation showed a strong correlation when compared to previous studies, indicating a high level of agreement and consistency between the results. The study's conclusions indicate that the velocity profile increases with higher values of {\lambda} and {\delta}, while it decreases with higher values of A, {\delta}v, and M. The micro-rotation profile F({\eta}) drops as the spin gradient viscosity parameter rises, but G({\eta}) increases. The temperature profile decreases with higher Prandtl numbers but increases with higher thermophoresis parameters. The concentration profile decreases with higher Schmidt numbers and Brownian motion parameters. The microorganism profile increases with higher Peclet numbers and microorganism slip parameters but decreases with higher bio-convection Schmidt numbers. Lastly, the local Nusselt number grows with increasing values of the stretching parameter {\lambda}.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical investigation of heat transfer of porous fin in a local thermal non-equilibrium state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research employs a local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model to analyze the heat transfer phenomenon through a porous fin, considering natural convection and radiation effects. The infiltration velocity within the porous medium is evaluated using the Darcy model, and buoyancy effects are accounted for using the Boussinesq approximation. The Akbari-Ganji method (AGM) is applied to address the governing energy equations. The accuracy of the proposed solution is verified by comparing it with numerical results obtained from the finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and earlier investigations. The results are presented regarding the total average Nusselt number and temperature profiles. These results shed light on the influence of several important parameters, such as the thermal conductivity ratio, dimensionless thickness, convectional heat transfer, and external and internal radiation. The analysis reveals that decreasing Rayleigh and Biot numbers reduces the temperature profiles of the solid phase. Additionally, when the Rayleigh number is low but the assigned Biot number is high, the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases diminishes. Furthermore, increased thermal conductivity ratio and dimensionless thickness for assigned Biot and Rayleigh numbers lead to higher solid phase temperatures. The Nusselt number exhibits a decreasing trend with a decreasing thermal conductivity ratio but increases with higher Rayleigh and Biot numbers and increased external radiation.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity dependence of the Navier-Stokes turbulence of a two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection on time-step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection governed by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is solved by traditional direct numerical simulation (DNS) using double precision and various time-steps. It is found that there are two kinds of final flow types, one is vortical flow, the other is zonal flow, and their statistics are completely different. Especially, the two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step decreases to a very small value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each type of turbulent flows should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise has huge influences on final flow type and statistics of numerical simulation of the NS turbulence (i.e. turbulence governed by NS equations), since time-step has a close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations as turbulence model have such an assumption that all small stochastic disturbances for $t&gt;0$ are negligible. This leads to a logic paradox in theory. Obviously, more investigations are necessary to reveal the essential differences between the NS turbulence, its numerical simulation, and real turbulence.</description>

      <title>Impact of Wind Direction on Flow Over a Realistic Urban Area: A Large-Eddy Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted high-resolution large-eddy simulations over a real urban district in Barcelona to examine the impact of wind direction on near-ground flow. The computational mesh resolves over 500 million degrees of freedom, with a spatial resolution on the order of 1 m at pedestrian level. This allows a detailed analysis of mean velocity and turbulence patterns within the canopy layer. Although instantaneous flow fields differ significantly between cases, double-averaged profiles of velocity and turbulence intensity remain remarkably consistent across all wind directions. The results reveal a shear-driven mixing layer below the average building height and turbulence maxima near the tallest buildings, highlighting the influence of urban morphology on the development of flow and turbulence.</description>

      <title>A novel spatial distribution method for wind farm parameterizations based on the Gaussian function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind farm parameterizations are crucial for quantifying the wind-farm atmosphere interaction, where wind turbines are typically modeled as elevated momentum sinks and sources of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). These quantities must be properly distributed to the mesoscale grid. Existing parameterizations use the single-column method. However, this method can easily lead to the errors of the spatial distribution of the sink and source, thereby impacting the accuracy of mesoscale flow simulations. To this end, we propose a multi-column spatial distribution method based on the Gaussian function. This method distributes the sink and source to multiple vertical grid columns based on the grid weights, which are analytically determined by integrating the two-dimensional Gaussian function over the mesoscale grid. We have applied this method to the classic Fitch model, proposed the improved Fitch-Gaussian model, and integrated it into the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model. Using high-fidelity large eddy simulation as a benchmark, we compared the performance of the proposed method with the single-column method. The results show that the proposed method captures the spatial distribution of the sink and source more accurately, with a higher correlation coefficient and lower normalized root mean square error. Furthermore, the Fitch-Gaussian model better captures the overall spatial distribution patterns of velocity deficit and added TKE. Therefore, the proposed method is recommended for future mesoscale wind farm simulations, especially when the influence of the wind turbine rotor spans multiple mesoscale grid columns.</description>

      <title>A framework for realisable data-driven active flow control using model predictive control applied to a simplified truck wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient and realisable active flow control framework with few non-intrusive sensors. The method builds upon data-driven, reduced-order predictive models based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and efficient gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC). The model uses only surface-mounted pressure probes to infer the wake state, and is trained entirely offline on a dataset built with open-loop actuations, thus avoiding the complexities of online learning. Sparsification of the sensors needed for control from an initially large set is achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations. A parsimonious set of sensors is then deployed in closed-loop control with MPC. The framework is tested in numerical simulations of a 2D truck model at Reynolds number 500, with pulsed-jet actuators placed in the rear of the truck to control the wake.

      <title>Verification of Convergent-Divergent Nozzle Designs in Propulsion Aerospace Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of convergent divergent nozzles plays a critical role in aerospace propulsion systems, where efficient expansion of high-temperature, high-pressure gases directly impacts thrust generation. In this study, we investigate a series of nozzle geometries using numerical simulations performed in ANSYS Fluent, with design parameters guided by classical compressible flow theory, initially developed by Ludwig Prandtl. The governing equations of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are solved under steady state conditions, with emphasis on shock formation, boundary-layer effects, and Mach number distributions across the nozzle throat and divergent section. Parametric analyses are conducted to evaluate the influence of nozzle contour, area ratio, and throat geometry on flow acceleration and thrust coefficient. The results demonstrate close agreement with theoretical predictions of isentropic compressible flow while also highlighting deviations due to viscous and three-dimensional effects. These findings provide design insights for optimizing nozzle performance in propulsion applications ranging from launch vehicles to high speed air breathing systems.</description>

Abstract: Active flexible filaments form the classical continuum framework for modelling the locomotion of spermatozoa and algae driven by the periodic oscillation of flagella. This framework also applies to the locomotion of various artificial swimmers. Classical studies have quantified the relationship between internal forcing (localised or distributed internal moments or forces) and external output (filament shape and swimming speed). In this paper, we pose locomotion as a mathematical optimisation problem and demonstrate that the swimming of an isolated active filament can be accurately described and optimised using a small number of eigenmodes, significantly reducing computational complexity. In particular, we reveal that the motion of a filament with monophasic forcing, relevant to recently proposed artificial swimmers, is governed by exactly four forcing eigenmodes, only two of which are independent. We further present optimisations of such swimmers under various constraints.</description>

      <title>Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.</description>

      <title>A family of three maximally symmetric boost-invariant flows in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the constructions of boost-invariant dissipative conformal hydrodynamic flows by elaborating on the geometric procedure by Gubser and Yarom, which starts from a static, maximally symmetric flow on dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$. Three foliations of dS$_3$ preserve three-dimensional non-Abelian isometry groups, namely, the flat ISO(2)-invariant, the spherical (closed) SO(3)-invariant, and the hyperbolic (open) SO(2,1)-invariant slicings. I show that the fluids that preserve these symmetries, after they have been Weyl transformed to flat spacetime, give rise to three physically distinct and boost-invariant solutions of the relativistic dissipative Navier-Stokes equations: the well-known and widely studied Bjorken and Gubser flows, and a seemingly thus far unexplored solution that arises from the hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3$. The new solution combines the radial expansion characteristic of the Gubser flow with the late-proper-time applicability of Bjorken's solution, and features a finite, radially bounded droplet whose expanding edge resembles a free-streaming shockwave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article examines the complex dynamics of thin-film flows of granular suspensions spreading over rigid solid substrates with free air interfaces. Such systems feature an involved coupling of the free-surface dynamics with the flow and microstructure of the suspension. In particular, we develop two canonical thin-film situations: drop spreading and dip-coating. In drop spreading, confinement of the particulate phase near the advancing contact line alters both the spreading rate and the interface shape. In dip-coating, understanding the entrainment of fluid and particles becomes challenging as the film thickness approaches the particle size.</description>

      <title>Far-Field Aeroacoustic Shape Optimization Using Large Eddy Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a shape optimization framework that combines a Flux Reconstruction (FR) spatial discretization, Large Eddy Simulation (LES), the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) formulation, and the gradient-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) optimization algorithm. We emphasize the necessity of duplicating the data surface to achieve accurate far-field noise prediction in spanwise periodic problems using the FW-H formulation. The proposed parallel implementation of the optimization framework ensures consistent runtime per optimization iteration, regardless of the number of design parameters, thereby addressing a common limitation of many gradient-free algorithms. The framework is demonstrated through far-field aeroacoustic shape optimization of NACA 4-digit airfoils at a Reynolds number of $23,000$. The objective function minimizes the Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) at a far-field observer positioned $10$ unit chords below the trailing edge, while preserving the mean lift coefficient and reducing the mean drag coefficient. The optimized airfoil achieves an OASPL reduction of $5.9~dB$ and over $14\%$ decrease in mean drag, while maintaining the mean lift coefficient. These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for practical shape optimization applications.</description>

      <title>Premixed flame quenching distance between cold walls: effects of flow and Lewis number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the critical conditions for flame propagation in channels with cold walls. We analyze the impact of the Lewis number and flow amplitude ($A$) on the minimum channel width required to sustain a premixed flame. Our results span a wide range of Lewis numbers, encompassing both aiding and opposing flow conditions. Results are presented for both variable and constant density models. A combined numerical approach, involving stationary and time-dependent simulations, is employed to determine quenching distances and solution stability. We find that smaller Lewis numbers and aiding flows ($A &lt; 0$) facilitate flame propagation in narrower channels, while opposing flows ($A &gt; 0$) tend to destabilize the flame, promoting asymmetric solutions. For sufficiently large positive values of $A$, the quenching distance is determined by asymmetric solutions, rather than the typical symmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Growth rate and energy dissipation in wind-forced breaking waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the energy growth and dissipation of wind-forced breaking waves at high wind speed using direct numerical simulations of the coupled air-water Navier-Stokes equations. A turbulent wind boundary layer drives the growth of a pre-existing narrowband wave field until it breaks, transferring energy into the water column. Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field resumes growth. We separately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking-induced dissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and turbulent dissipation during breaking. Wind input during growth is balanced with dissipation during breaking over an entire growing-breaking cycle. The wave growth rate scales with $(u_\ast/c)^2$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering, and the energy dissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking, confirming the universality of the process. Following breaking, near-surface vertical turbulence dissipation profiles scale as $z^{-1}$, with their magnitude controlled by the breaking-induced dissipation.</description>

      <title>Elastohydrodynamics of 3D chemically active filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength and nature of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with a computationally efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics. Through two illustrative examples, we conduct initial-value simulations that show that, as the stiffness of the filament is decreased, the dynamic behaviour moves from rigid motion to planar buckling, through an out-of-plane transition, eventually reaching diffusive-like behaviours for very deformable filaments.</description>

      <title>Clean numerical simulation (CNS) of three-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. Thus, due to the famous butterfly-effect of chaos, unavoidable numerical noises of DNS might have great influence on spatiotemporal trajectories of turbulence. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence. Thus, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are indeed badly polluted by numerical noise rather quickly, and besides the DNS result has significant deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the spatial symmetry of flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of turbulence and turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic forced convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate properties of turbulence and turbulent transport of non-inertial particles described in terms of turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic convection forced by two similar turbulence generators with oscillating membrane and a steady grid in the air flow (with the Rayleigh number about $10^8$). Velocity field and spatial distribution of particles are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry system. The temperature distribution is measured in many locations using a temperature probe equipped with 12 E - thermocouples. In the forced convection, the gradients of the mean temperature field and the particle number density in the horizontal direction in the core flow are much stronger than in the vertical direction. The mean fluid velocity structure show transition between a single-roll pattern for isothermal turbulence to double-roll patterns with increase of the temperature difference between the bottom and upper walls of the chamber. For larger temperature differences, the mean fluid velocity structure returns to a single-roll pattern. In the turbulent regions with large mean temperature gradients, the dominant effect of the large-scale particle clustering is turbulent thermal diffusion, resulting in that the maximum of the mean particle number density is located in the regions with minimum of the mean temperature and vise versa. Deviations from this feature is observed in the regions with strong mean fluid velocities where the mean temperature gradients are small.</description>

Abstract: This work presents an analytical investigation of the hydrodynamic entrance region in laminar flows through slender converging pipes. Extending previous analyses for straight pipes, the model radially divides the flow into a viscous wall region and a central core where both inertia and viscous effects are important. The study analyzes the impact of the inlet Reynolds number and convergence angle on the velocity profile and pressure drop. Results show that a converging geometry, which imposes a favorable pressure gradient, significantly shortens the hydrodynamic entrance length compared to a straight pipe. Analytical solutions show good agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Composite B-Spline Regularized Delta Functions for the Immersed Boundary Method: Divergence-Free Interpolation and Gradient-Preserving Force Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to enhance volume conservation in the immersed boundary (IB) method by using regularized delta functions derived from composite B-splines. The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the Navier--Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that transcends traditional computational limitations.</description>
