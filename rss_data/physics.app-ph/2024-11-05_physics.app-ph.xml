      <title>Humidity-enhanced NO$_2$ gas sensing using atomically sharp edges in multilayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambient humidity poses a significant challenge in the development of practical room temperature NO$_2$ gas sensors. Here, we employ atomically precise zigzag edges in multilayer MoS$_2$, fabricated using electron beam lithography and anisotropic wet etching, to achieve highly sensitive and selective gas sensing performance that is humidity-tolerant at elevated temperatures and humidity-enhanced at room temperature under ultraviolet illumination. Notably, exposure to 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) NO$_2$ at 70% relative humidity under ultraviolet illumination and at room-temperature resulted in a 33-fold increase in response and a 6-fold faster recovery compared to 0% relative humidity, leading to response values exceeding 1100%. The optimized samples demonstrated a theoretical detection limit ranging from 4 to 400 parts per trillion (ppt) NO$_2$. The enhanced NO$_2$ sensing capabilities of MoS$_2$ edges have been further confirmed through first-principles calculations. Our study expands the applications of nanostructured MoS$_2$ and highlights its potential for detecting NO$_2$ at sub-ppb levels in complex scenarios, such as high humidity conditions.</description>

      <title>A Phononic Crystal Waveguide Using Surface Waves Below the Sound Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves are commonly used in a variety of radio-frequency electrical devices as a result of their operation at high frequencies and robust nature. For devices based on Rayleigh-like plane waves, functionality is based on the fact that the Rayleigh wave mode is confined at the solid-air interface. However, to create advanced functionality through the use of phononic crystal structures, standard cylindrical inclusions have been shown to couple Rayleigh modes to the shear horizontal bulk modes and provide a significant pathway to energy loss. We introduce alternative inclusion shapes with a reduced 2-fold symmetry that lowers the speed of the Rayleigh-like surface acoustic wave to below that of the shear horizontal mode. With an eigenfrequency below the sound line, the new mode is confined to the surface with limited coupling and loss to the bulk. Based on these inclusions, an acoustic waveguide design is proposed that demonstrates a strong confinement of wave energy both at the surface and within the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Copper-based disordered plasmonic system with dense nanoisland morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dry synthesis is a highly versatile method for the fabrication of nanoporous metal films, since it enables easy and reproducible deposition of single or multi-layer(s) of nanostructured materials that can find intriguing applications in plasmonics, photochemistry and photocatalysis, to name a few. Here, we extend the use of this methodology to the preparation of copper nanoislands that represent an affordable and versatile example of disordered plasmonic substrate. We perform detailed characterizations of the system using several techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry, cathodoluminescence, electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation with the aim to investigate the optical properties of these systems in an unprecedented systematic way. Our study represents the starting point for future applications of this new disordered plasmonic system ranging from sensing to photochemistry and photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Trion Engineered Multimodal Transistors in Two dimensional Bilayer Semiconductor Lateral Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal device operations are essential to advancing the integration of 2D semiconductors in electronics, photonics, information and quantum technology. Precise control over carrier dynamics, particularly exciton generation and transport, is crucial for finetuning the functionality of optoelectronic devices based on 2D semiconductor heterostructure. However, the traditional exciton engineering methods in 2D semiconductors are mainly restricted to the artificially assembled vertical pn heterostructures with electrical or strain induced confinements. In this study, we utilized bilayer 2D lateral npn multijunction heterostructures with intrinsically spatially separated energy landscapes to achieve preferential exciton generation and manipulation without external confinement. In lateral npn FET geometry, we uncover unique and nontrivial properties, including dynamic tuning of channel photoresponsivity from positive to negative. The multimodal operation of these 2D FETs is achieved by carefully adjusting electrical bias and the impinging photon energy, enabling precise control over the trions generation and transport. Cryogenic photoluminescence measurement revealed the presence of trions in bilayer MoSe2 and intrinsic trap states in WSe2. Measurements in different FET device geometries show the multifunctionality of 2D lateral heterostructure phototransistors for efficient tuning and electrical manipulation of excitonic characteristics. Our findings pave the way for developing practical exciton-based transistors, sensors, multimodal optoelectronic and quantum technologies</description>

      <title>The Impact of TaS$_{2}$-Augmented Interconnects on Circuit Performance: A Temperature-Dependent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer TaS$_{2}$ is being explored as a future liner/barrier to circumvent the scalability issues of the state-of-the-art interconnects. However, its large vertical resistivity poses some concerns and mandates a comprehensive circuit analysis to understand the benefits and trade-offs of this technology. In this work, we present a detailed temperature-dependent modeling framework of TaS$_{2}$-augmented copper (Cu) interconnects and provide insights into their circuit implications. We build temperature-dependent 3D models for Cu-TaS$_{2}$ interconnect resistance capturing surface scattering and grain boundary scattering and integrate them in an RTL-GDSII design flow based on ASAP7 7nm process design kit. Using this framework, we perform synthesis and place-and-route (PnR) for advanced encryption standard (AES) circuit at different process and temperature corners and benchmark the circuit performance of Cu-TaS$_{2}$ interconnects against state-of-the-art interconnects. Our results show that Cu-TaS$_{2}$ interconnects yield an enhancement in the effective clock frequency of the AES circuit by 1%-10.6%. Considering the worst-case process-temperature corner, we further establish that the vertical resistivity of TaS$_{2}$ must be below 22 k${\Omega}$-nm to obtain performance benefits over conventional interconnects.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz Law and Thermoelectric Inequalities: Effective ZT and Single-leg Efficiency Overestimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01635v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a thermoelectric inequality in thermoelectric conversion between the material figure of merit (ZT) and the module effective ZT using the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation combining with the Wiedemann-Franz law. In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT values of the P- and N-legs. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT is less than approximately one-third of the leg's ZT. This reduction results from the need for an external wire to complete the circuit, introducing additional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis shows that, although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the system efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg material efficiency. Our findings explain the single-leg efficiency overestimation and highlight the importance of optimizing the P-N leg-pair module structure. They also underscore the need for thermoelectric leg-compatibility, particularly with respect to Seebeck coefficients.</description>

      <title>Hafnia-based Phase-Change Ferroelectric Steep-Switching FETs on a 2-D MoS$_2$ platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric field-effect transistors integrated on 2D semiconducting platforms are extremely relevant for low power electronics. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel phase-change ferroelectric field effect transistor (PCFE-FET) for steep switching applications. Our gate stack is engineered as a ferroelectric Lanthanum doped hafnium oxide (LHO) proximity coupled with Mott insulator Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) and is integrated onto a 2D MoS$_2$ channel. The interplay of partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric LHO layer and reversible field-tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) in Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) layer concomitantly triggers polar to non-polar phase transition in the LHO layer between 200 and 220 K. This results in distinctive step-like features in the channel current during DC measurements, and random current fluctuations in high-speed measurements with slim anticlockwise hysteresis. Our devices show subthreshold slopes as steep as 25 mV/dec at 210 K, breaking the Boltzmann limit. Our gate stack is also potentially tunable for operation at temperatures of interest, presenting innovative gate stack engineering approaches for low-power computing solutions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Miniature On-chip Fourier Transform Spectrometer For Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniaturized spectrometers for Raman spectroscopy have the potential to open up a new chapter in sensing. Raman spectroscopy is essential for material characterization and biomedical diagnostics, however, its weak signal and the need for sub-nanometer resolution pose challenges. Conventional spectrometers, with footprints proportional to optical throughput and resolution, are difficult to integrate into compact devices such as wearables. Waveguide-based Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS) enable compact spectrometers, and multi-aperture designs can achieve high throughput for applications such as Raman spectroscopy, however, experimental research in this domain remains limited. In this work, we present a multi-aperture SiN waveguide-based FTS overcoming these limitations and enabling Raman spectroscopy of isopropyl alcohol, glucose, Paracetamol, and Ibuprofen with enhanced throughput. Our spectrometer chip, fabricated on a 200 mm SiN wafer, with 160 edge-coupled waveguide apertures connected to an array of ultra-compact interferometers and a small footprint of just 1.6 mm x 4.8 mm, achieves a spectral range of 40 nm and a resolution of 0.5 nm. Experimental results demonstrate that least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression significantly enhances Raman spectrum reconstruction. Our work on waveguide-based spectrometry paves the way for integrating accurate and compact Raman sensors into consumer electronics and space exploration instruments.</description>

      <title>Controlled Delivery of Reactive Oxygen Species by Functionalized Catalytic Plasma Coatings for Antimicrobial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing complications due to bacterial and viral infections require novel antimicrobial approaches. One emerging strategy is that based on catalysts able to selectively deliver reactive oxygen species (ROS) without leaching of other substances. In particular, metal oxide thin films activated by daylight can produce ROS by simply catalyzing oxygen and water molecules. This study examines plasma technology, combining deposition and oxidation processes, as well as plasma polymerization, to obtain functionalized AgOx-doped titanium oxide (TiOx) catalytic materials. The high-energy conditions in the reactive, ionized gas enable the intrinsic formation of a large number of reactive sites at defects and interfaces between the metal oxide nanostructures. Furthermore, plasma functionalization with nanoporous SiOx films (up to 100 nm thick) allows to precisely control the ROS delivery as well as unravel ROS formation mechanism at the metal oxide interface. Combining fluorescence spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, the controlled delivery of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen has been tuned based on the thickness of the nanoporous functional layer. ROS delivery by functionalized catalytic plasma coating has been related to excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli bacteria as well as murine hepatitis virus, while avoiding cytotoxic and sensitization effects.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Microstructural Evolution in All-Solid-State Micro-Batteries through in situ Electrochemical TEM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-solid-state batteries hold great promise for electric vehicle applications due to their enhanced safety and higher energy density. However, further performance optimization requires a deeper understanding of their degradation mechanisms, particularly at the nanoscale. This study investigates the real-time degradation processes of an oxide-based all-solid-state micro-battery, using focused ion beam lamellae composed of LAGP as the solid electrolyte, LiFePO4 (LFP) composite as the positive electrode, and LiVPO4 (LVP) composite as the negative electrode. In situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed critical degradation phenomena, including the formation of cracks along grain boundaries in the solid electrolyte due to lithium diffusion and mechanical stress. Additionally, the shrinkage of solid electrolyte particles and the formation of amorphous phases were observed. These findings highlight the importance of grain boundary dynamics and amorphization in the performance of solid electrolytes and provide insights into degradation mechanisms that can inform the design of more durable all-solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Ultra-Low-Loss, Dispersion-Engineered Silicon Nitride Photonic Integrated Circuits via Silicon Hardmask Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have emerged as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, such as nonlinear optics, narrow-linewidth lasers, and quantum photonics. While thin-film Si$_3$N$_4$ processes have been extensively developed, many nonlinear and quantum optics applications require the use of thick Si$_3$N$_4$ films with engineered dispersion, high mode confinement, and low optical loss. However, high tensile stress in thick Si$_3$N$_4$ films often leads to cracking, making the fabrication challenging to meet these requirements. In this work, we present a robust and reliable fabrication method for ultra-low-loss, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs using amorphous silicon (a-Si) hardmask etching. This approach enables smooth etching of thick Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides while ensuring long-term storage of crack-free Si$_3$N$_4$ wafers. We achieve intrinsic quality factors ($Q_i$) as high as $25.6 \times 10^6$, corresponding to a propagation loss of 1.6 dB/m. The introduction of a-Si hardmask etching and novel crack-isolation trenches offers notable advantages, including high etching selectivity, long-term wafer storage, high yield, and full compatibility with existing well-developed silicon-based semiconductor processes. We demonstrate frequency comb generation in the fabricated microring resonators, showcasing the platform's potential for applications in optical communication, nonlinear optics, metrology, and spectroscopy. This stable and efficient fabrication method offers high performance with significantly reduced fabrication complexity, representing a remarkable advancement toward mass production of Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs for a wide spectrum of applications.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale 3D structural dynamics and functional degradation of Pt alloy nanocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pt-based electrocatalysts are the primary choice for fuel cells due to their superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. To enhance ORR performance and durability, extensive studies have investigated transition metal alloying, doping, and shape control to optimize the three key governing factors for ORR: geometry, local chemistry, and strain of their surface and subsurface. However, systematic optimization remains incomplete, as it requires an atomic-scale understanding of these factors and their dynamics over potential cycling, as well as their relationship to ORR activity. Here, we implement neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography to measure the 3D atomic structural dynamics and their effects on the functional degradation of PtNi alloy catalysts. Our results reveal that PtNi catalysts undergo shape changes, surface alloying, and strain relaxation during cycling, which can be effectively mitigated by Ga doping. By combining geometry, local chemistry, and strain analysis, we calculated the changes in ORR activity over thousands of cycles and observed that Ga doping leads to higher initial activity and greater stability. These findings offer a pathway to understanding 3D atomic structural dynamics and their relation to ORR activity during cycling, paving the way for the systematic design of durable, high-efficiency nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Electrostatic Patch Force Evaluation on the Lateral Resolution of Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) is widely used to measure the surface potential on samples, from which electrostatic patch force can be calculated. However, since the KPFM measurements represent a weighted average of local potentials on the sample, the accuracy of the evaluation critically depends on the precision and lateral resolution of the method. In this paper, we investigate the influence of this averaging effect on patch force estimations using both analytic and numerical methods. First, we derive the correlation functions of patch potential and establish the formulas for calculating the electrostatic patch forces in the parallel-plate geometry, with and without consideration of the KPFM measurement effect. Thus, an analytic method is established to determine the accuracy of patch force evaluation when the statistical parameters of the patch potential and the lateral resolution of the KPFM are given. Second, numerical simulations are employed to explore the dependence of estimated patch forces on the KPFM's lateral resolution under more realistic conditions. Both analytic and numerical results show a similar dependence of the patch force estimation on the patch characteristic size, potential fluctuation and the lateral resolution of the KPFM. It is also found that the underestimation of the patch force becomes less sensitive to the KPFM's resolution as the separation between plates increases. The results of this study could provide useful guidance for the accurate evaluation of electrostatic patch forces using KPFM.</description>

      <title>Single-layer spin-orbit-torque magnetization switching due to spin Berry curvature generated by minute spontaneous atomic displacement in a Weyl oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin-orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach has not been applied to devices; generally, the extrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT-induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single-crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of ~3.1{\times}10^6 A cm-2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of ~5{\deg} near the interface with a substrate. Tight-binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin-orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. Our results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single-crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin-orbitronics devices.</description>

      <title>Deriving mobility-lifetime products in halide perovskite films from spectrally- and time-resolved photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites are semiconductor materials with attractive properties for photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications. However, determining crucial electronic material parameters, such as charge-carrier mobility and lifetime, is plagued by a wide range of reported values and inconsistencies caused by interpreting and reporting data originating from different measurement techniques. In this paper, we propose a method for the simultaneous determination of mobility and lifetime using only one technique: transient photoluminescence spectroscopy. By measuring and simulating the decay of the photoluminescence intensity and the redshift of the photoluminescence peak as a function of time after the laser pulse, we extract the mobility, lifetime, and diffusion length of halide perovskite films. With a voltage-dependent steady-state photoluminescence measurement on a cell, we relate the diffusion length to the external voltage and quantify its value at the maximum power point.</description>

      <title>Manipulating terahertz phonon-polariton in the ultrastrong coupling regime with bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling between photons and phonons in polar materials gives rise to phonon-polaritons that encapsulate a wealth of physical information, offering crucial tools for the ultrafast terahertz sources and the topological engineering of terahertz light. However, it is still quite challenging to form and manipulate the terahertz phonon-polaritons under the ultrastrong coupling regime till now. In this work, we demonstrate the ultrastrong coupling between the phonon (at 0.95 THz) in a MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film and the metallic bound states in the continuum (BICs) in Au metasurfaces. The Rabi splitting can be continuously tuned from 28% to 48.4% of the phonon frequency by adjusting the parameters (size, shape and period) of Au metasurfaces, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. By introducing wavelet transform, the mode evolution information of the terahertz phonon-polariton is successfully extracted. It indicates that the phonon radiation intensity of the MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film is enhanced as the coupling strength is increased. This work not only establishes a new platform for terahertz devices but also opens new avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of terahertz phonon-polaritons.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties of metamorphic GaSbBi films on GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the electronic, structural, and optical properties of epitaxial GaSbBi films with varying Bi-concentration (up to 7%Bi) grown on semi-insulating GaAs(100) substrates. The 1 $\mu$m thick GaSbBi epilayers exhibit fully relaxed narrow X-ray diffraction peaks and smooth surface morphology comparable to that of high-quality GaSb epilayers on GaAs. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra exhibit band gap shrinkage consistent with Bi alloying. Electrical Hall measurements indicate reduction of hole concentration and no change in the hole mobilities with increasing Bi content for the nominally undoped GaSbBi alloy. The residual hole concentration reduces from $10^{18} cm^{-3}$ level for a reference GaSb sample, to low $10^{17} cm^{-3}$ level with increasing Bi content. Hole mobility values of around $300 cm^{2}/Vs$ are observed independent of the Bi content. These dependencies are attributed to the Bi surfactant effect and Bi-induced defect formation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensing of Momentum Kicks with a Feedback-Controlled Nanomechanical Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External disturbances exciting a mechanical resonator can be exploited to gain information on the environment. Many of these interactions manifest as momentum kicks, such as the recoil of residual gas, radioactive decay, or even hypothetical interactions with dark matter. These disturbances are often rare enough that they can be resolved as singular events rather than cumulated as force noise. While high-Q resonators with low masses are particularly sensitive to such momentum kicks, they will strongly excite the resonator, leading to nonlinear effects that deteriorate the sensing performance. Hence, this paper utilizes optimal estimation methods to extract individual momentum kicks from measured stochastic trajectories of a mechanical resonator kept in the linear regime through feedback control. The developed scheme is illustrated and tested experimentally using a pre-stressed SiN trampoline resonator. Apart from enhancing a wide range of sensing scenarios mentioned above, our results indicate the feasibility of novel single-molecule mass spectrometry approaches.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Graphene-based Sub-Terahertz Receivers enabling Wireless Communications for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the telecommunications field has experienced an unparalleled proliferation of wireless data traffic. Innovative solutions are imperative to circumvent the inherent limitations of the current technology, in particular in terms of capacity. Carrier frequencies in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) range (~0.2-0.3 THz) can deliver increased capacity and low attenuation for short-range wireless applications. Here, we demonstrate a direct, passive and compact sub-THz receiver based on graphene, which outperforms state-of-the-art sub-THz receivers. These graphene-based receivers offer a cost-effective, CMOS-compatible, small-footprint solution that can fulfill the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) requirements of 6G technologies. We exploit a sub-THz cavity, comprising an antenna and a back mirror, placed in the vicinity of the graphene channel to overcome the low inherent absorption in graphene and the mismatch between the areas of the photoactive region and the incident radiation, which becomes extreme in the sub-THz range. The graphene receivers achieve a multigigabit per second data rate with a maximum distance of ~3 m from the transmitter, a setup-limited 3 dB bandwidth of 40 GHz, and a high responsivity of 0.16 A/W, enabling applications such as chip-to-chip communication and close proximity device-to-device communication.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that show outstanding agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce muon beams with GeV energies and fluxes, at a few meters from the source, up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than cosmic ray muons. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high fluxes which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>

      <title>Generative inverse design of multimodal resonant structures for locally resonant metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the development of locally resonant metamaterials, the physical resonator design is often omitted and replaced by an idealized mass-spring system. This paper presents a novel approach for designing multimodal resonant structures, which give rise to multi-bandgap metamaterials with predefined band gaps. Our method uses a conditional variational autoencoder to identify nontrivial patterns between design variables of complex-shaped resonators and their modal effective parameters. After training, the cost of generating designs satisfying arbitrary criteria - frequency and mass of multiple modes - becomes negligible. An example of a resonator family with six geometric variables and two targeted modes is further elaborated. We find that the autoencoder performs well even when trained with a limited dataset, resulting from a few hundred numerical modal analyses. The method generates several designs that very closely approximate the desired modal characteristics. The accuracy of the best designs, proposed by the auto-encoder, is confirmed in tests of 3D-printed resonator prototypes. Further experiments demonstrate the close agreement between the measured and desired dispersion relation of a sample metamaterial beam.</description>

      <title>RCS reduction method with anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis : design modelling and measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. This work focuses the discussion on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the Floquet direction considered. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <title>An ultra-broadband photonic-chip-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication and data center interconnects, primarily relies on erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) to enhance signals without distortion. While EDFAs were historically decisive for the introduction of dense wavelength-division multiplexing, they only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibers. Pioneering work on optical traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) utilizing intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity and performance. TWPAs are unidirectional, offer high gain, and can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers. Despite the use of highly nonlinear fibers or bulk waveguides, their power requirements and technical complexity have impeded adoption. In contrast, TWPAs based on photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth because of the trade-off with maintaining low propagation loss. We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide PICs and attain up to 35~dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimeters long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimeters. Fiber-to-fiber net gain exceeding 10 dB across a bandwidth of approximately 140 nm is achieved, surpassing the gain window of a standard C-band EDFA. We furthermore demonstrate the capability to handle weak signals; input powers can range over six orders of magnitude while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify both optical frequency combs and coherent communication signals. This marks the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a PIC, opening up new capabilities for next-generation optical communication, metrology, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for realizing universal, entangling quantum gates with linear photonic elements alone.</description>

      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>
