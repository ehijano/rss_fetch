      <title>One-shot Parareal Approach for Topology Optimisation of Transient Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method of performing topology optimisation of transient heat conduction problems using the parallel-in-time method Parareal. To accommodate the adjoint analysis, the Parareal method was modified to store intermediate time steps. Preliminary tests revealed that Parareal requires many iterations to achieve accurate results and, thus, achieves no appreciable speedup. To mitigate this, a one-shot approach was used, where the time history is iteratively refined over the optimisation process. The method estimates objectives and sensitivities by introducing cumulative objectives and sensitivities and solving for these using a single iteration of Parareal, after which it updates the design using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. The resulting method was applied to a test problem where a power mean of the temperature was minimised. It achieved a peak speedup relative to a sequential reference method of $5\times$ using 16 threads. The resulting designs were similar to the one found by the reference method, both in terms of objective values and qualitative appearance. The one-shot Parareal method was compared to the Parallel Local-in-Time method of topology optimisation. This revealed that the Parallel Local-in-Time method was unstable for the considered test problem, but it achieved a peak speedup of $12\times$ using 32 threads. It was determined that the dominant bottleneck in the one-shot Parareal method was the time spent on computing coarse propagators.</description>

      <title>An isogemetric analysis formulation for the dynamics of geometrically exact viscoelastic beams and beam systems with arbitrarily curved initial geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel formulation for the dynamics of geometrically exact Timoshenko beams and beam structures made of viscoelastic material featuring complex, arbitrarily curved initial geometries. An $\textrm{SO}(3)$-consistent and second-order accurate time integration scheme for accelerations, velocities and rate-dependent viscoelastic strain measures is adopted. To achieve high efficiency and geometrical flexibility, the spatial discretization is carried out with the isogemetric collocation (IGA-C) method, which permits bypassing elements integration keeping all the advantages of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) in terms of high-order space accuracy and geometry representation. Moreover, a primal formulation guarantees the minimal kinematic unknowns. The generalized Maxwell model is deployed directly to the one-dimensional beam strain and stress measures. This allows to express the internal variables in terms of the same kinematic unknowns, as for the case of linear elastic rate-independent materials bypassing the complexities introduced by the viscoelastic material. As a result, existing $\textrm{SO}(3)$-consistent linearizations of the governing equations in the strong form (and associated updating formulas) can straightforwardly be used. Through a series of numerical tests, the attributes and potentialities of the proposed formulation are demonstrated. In particular, we show the capability to accurately simulate beams and beam systems featuring complex initial geometry and topology, opening interesting perspectives in the inverse design of programmable mechanical meta-materials and objects.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy and Efficiency in Calibration of Drinking Water Distribution Networks Through Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of drinking water distribution networks (DWDNs) as critical urban infrastructures has led to the development and utilization of models for the analysis, design, operation, and management of DWDNs, to ensure optimal efficiency and water quality. In order to provide models that accurately represent real-world behavior and characteristics of an actual DWDN, model calibration is an essential and crucial procedure (Alves et al., 2014). However, since DWDNs are generally large, underground networks, data availability for model calibration is often an issue. In this paper, we introduce a novel automatic calibration methodology called Expert Systems and Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (ES-NEAT). The proposed methodology leverages the power of Expert Systems (ES) and genetic algorithms for the evolution of neural network topologies to efficiently search for the optimal solution of high dimensional calibration problems while maintaining moderate computational effort. One of the key strengths of ES-NEAT lies in its ability to achieve high accuracy even with limited availability of measurements, addressing the inherent uncertainty in real-world DWDNs. By integrating specific knowledge provided by different stakeholders using the ES methodology, the framework offers a flexible approach that adapts to the unique characteristics of each drinking water distribution network. Moreover, the methodology is designed to store calibration information and transfer it in a structured format for use in subsequent calibration processes, increasing efficiency and ensuring generalizability. The method was successfully applied to a benchmark network model as well as a real-case study of a DWDN in Flanders, Belgium.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Institutional Portfolio Management: Persona-Based Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in various financial applications, though their potential in complex investment strategies remains underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how LLMs can predict price movements in stock and bond portfolios using economic indicators, enabling portfolio adjustments akin to those employed by institutional investors. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating different personas within LLMs, using an ensemble approach to leverage their diverse predictions. Our findings show that LLM-based strategies, especially when combined with the mode ensemble, outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in terms of Sharpe ratio during periods of rising consumer price index (CPI). However, traditional strategies are more effective during declining CPI trends or sharp market downturns. These results suggest that while LLMs can enhance portfolio management, they may require complementary strategies to optimize performance across varying market conditions.</description>

      <title>On analytical integration of interaction potentials between cylindrical and rectangular bodies with a focus on van der Waals attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the analytical integration of interaction potentials between specific geometries such as disks, cylinders, rectangles, and rectangular prisms. Interaction potentials are modeled as inverse-power laws with respect to the point-pair distance, and the complete body-body potential is obtained by pairwise summation (integration). Several exact new interaction laws are obtained, such as disk-plate and (in-plane) rectangle-rectangle for an arbitrary exponent, and disk-disk and rectangle-rectangle for van der Waals attraction. To balance efficiency and accuracy, additional approximate laws are proposed for disk-disk, point-cylinder, and disk-cylinder interactions. A brief numerical example illustrates the application of the pre-integrated Lennard-Jones disk-disk interaction potential for the interaction between elastic fibers.</description>

      <title>A Cloud-based Real-time Probabilistic Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation using the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is an important metric that helps in condition-based maintenance. Damage data obtained from the diagnostics techniques are often noisy and the RUL estimated from the data is less reliable. Estimating the probabilistic RUL by quantifying the uncertainty in the predictive model parameters using the noisy data increases confidence in the predicted values. Uncertainty quantification methods generate statistical samples for the model parameters, that represent the uncertainty, by evaluating the predictive model several times. The computational time for solving a physics-based predictive model is significant, which makes the statistical techniques to be computationally expensive. It is essential to reduce the computational time to estimate the RUL in a feasible time. In this work, real-time probabilistic RUL estimation is demonstrated in adhesively bonded joints using the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling method and cloud-based computations. The SMC sampling method is an alternative to traditional MCMC methods, which enables generating the statistical parameter samples in parallel. The parallel computational capabilities of the SMC methods are exploited by running the SMC simulation on multiple cloud calls. This approach is demonstrated by estimating fatigue RUL in the adhesively bonded joint. The accuracy of probabilistic RUL estimated by SMC is validated by comparing it with RUL estimated by the MCMC and the experimental values. The SMC simulation is run on the cloud and the computational speedup of the SMC is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle trajectories, with their detailed geolocations, are a promising data source to compute traffic flow maps which facilitate the understanding of traffic flows at scales ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The trade-off is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial obstacles for small-scale aggregation. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We then deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales.</description>
