      <title>Hydrodynamic Whispering: Enabling Near-Field Silent Communication via Artificial Lateral Line Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the imperative for covert underwater swarm coordination, this paper introduces "Hydrodynamic Whispering," a near-field silent communication paradigm utilizing Artificial Lateral Line (ALL) arrays. Grounded in potential flow theory, we model the transmitter as an oscillating dipole source. The resulting pressure field exhibits steep nearfield attenuation (scaling with 1/r^2, naturally delimiting a secure "communication bubble" with intrinsic Low Probability of Interception (LPI) properties. We propose a transceiver architecture featuring a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation scheme adapted for mechanical actuator inertia, coupled with a bio-inspired 24-sensor conformal array. To mitigate low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in turbulent environments,a Spatio-Temporal Joint Processing framework incorporating Spatial Matched-Field Beamforming is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the system achieves an array gain of approximately 13.8 dB and maintains a near-zero Bit Error Rate (BER) within the effective range. This study validates the feasibility of utilizing localized hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations for reliable and secure short-range underwater networking.</description>

      <title>Beyond Path Loss: Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Modeling for UAV Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a measurement-based framework for characterizing altitude-dependent spectral behavior of signals received by a tethered Helikite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models.</description>

      <title>AI-Native 6G Physical Layer with Cross-Module Optimization and Cooperative Control Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a framework of AI-native cross-module optimized physical layer with cooperative control agents is proposed, which involves optimization across global AI/ML modules of the physical layer with innovative design of multiple enhancement mechanisms and control strategies. Specifically, it achieves simultaneous optimization across global modules of uplink AI/ML-based joint source-channel coding with modulation, and downlink AI/ML-based modulation with precoding and corresponding data detection, reducing traditional inter-module information barriers to facilitate end-to-end optimization toward global objectives. Moreover, multiple enhancement mechanisms are also proposed, including i) an AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation approach with theoretical analysis for downlink transmission that breaks the isolation of inter-layer features to expand the solution space for determining improved constellation, ii) a utility-oriented precoder construction method that shifts the role of the AI/ML-based CSI feedback decoder from recovering the original CSI to directly generating precoding matrices aiming to improve end-to-end performance, and iii) incorporating modulation into AI/ML-based CSI feedback to bypass bit-level bottlenecks that introduce quantization errors, non-differentiable gradients, and limitations in constellation solution spaces. Furthermore, AI/ML based control agents for optimized transmission schemes are proposed that leverage AI/ML to perform model switching according to channel state, thereby enabling integrated control for global throughput optimization. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions in terms of BLER and throughput. These extensive simulations employ more practical assumptions that are aligned with the requirements of the 3GPP, which hopefully provides valuable insights for future standardization discussions.</description>

      <title>Transparent and Resilient Activity Recognition via Attention-Based Distributed Radar Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed radar sensors enable robust human activity recognition. However, scaling the number of coordinated nodes introduces challenges in feature extraction from large datasets, and transparent data fusion. We propose an end-to-end framework that operates directly on raw radar data. Each radar node employs a lightweight 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local features. A self-attention fusion block then models inter-node relationships and performs adaptive information fusion. Local feature extraction reduces the input dimensionality by up to 480x. This significantly lowers communication overhead and latency. The attention mechanism provides inherent interpretability by quantifying the contribution of each radar node. A hybrid supervised contrastive loss further improves feature separability, especially for fine-grained and imbalanced activity classes. Experiments on real-world distributed Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces model complexity by 70.8\%, while achieving higher average accuracy than baseline approaches. Overall, the framework enables transparent, efficient, and low-overhead distributed radar sensing.</description>

      <title>Study of Class-Incremental Radio Frequency Fingerprint Recognition Without Storing Exemplars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of wireless devices makes robust identity authentication essential. Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) exploits device-specific, hard-to-forge physical-layer impairments for identification, and is promising for IoT and unmanned systems. In practice, however, new devices continuously join deployed systems while per-class training data are limited. Conventional static training and naive replay of stored exemplars are impractical due to growing class cardinality, storage cost, and privacy concerns.
  We propose an exemplar-free class-incremental learning framework tailored to RFF recognition. Starting from a pretrained feature extractor, we freeze the backbone during incremental stages and train only a classifier together with lightweight Adapter modules that perform small task-specific feature adjustments. For each class we fit a diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the backbone features and sample pseudo-features from these fitted distributions to rehearse past classes without storing raw signals. To improve robustness under few-shot conditions we introduce a time-domain random-masking augmentation and adopt a multi-teacher distillation scheme to compress stage-wise Adapters into a single inference Adapter, trading off accuracy and runtime efficiency.
  We evaluate the method on large, self-collected ADS-B datasets: the backbone is pretrained on 2,175 classes and incremental experiments are run on a disjoint set of 669 classes with multiple rounds and step sizes. Against several representative baselines, our approach consistently yields higher average accuracy and lower forgetting, while using substantially less storage and avoiding raw-data retention.
  The proposed pipeline is reproducible and provides a practical, low-storage solution for RFF deployment in resource- and privacy-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Variational Framework for Channel Prediction in High-Mobility 6G OTFS Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) based method for channel prediction in high mobility orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) channels. In these scenarios, rapid variations caused by Doppler spread and time varying multipath propagation lead to fast channel decorrelation, making conventional pilot based channel estimation methods prone to outdated channel state information (CSI) and excessive overhead. Therefore, reliable channel prediction methods become essential to support robust detection and decoding in OTFS systems. In this paper, we propose conditional variational autoencoder for channel prediction (CVAE4CP) method, which learns the conditional distribution of OTFS delay Doppler channel coefficients given physical system and mobility parameters. By incorporating these parameters as conditioning information, the proposed method enables the prediction of future channel coefficients before their actual realization, while accounting for inherent channel uncertainty through a low dimensional latent representation. The proposed framework is evaluated through extensive simulations under high mobility conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that CVAE4CP consistently outperforms a competing learning based baseline in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE), particularly at high Doppler frequencies and extended prediction horizons. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach for channel prediction in rapidly time varying OTFS systems.</description>

      <title>Post-Decision State-Based Online Learning for Delay-Energy-Aware Flow Allocation in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a structure-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach for delay- and energy-aware flow allocation in 5G User Plane Functions (UPFs). We consider a dynamic system with $K$ heterogeneous UPFs of varying capacities that handle stochastic arrivals of $M$ flow types, each with distinct rate requirements. We model the system as a Markov decision process (MDP) to capture the stochastic nature of flow arrivals and departures (possibly unknown), as well as the impact of flow allocation in the system. To solve this problem, we propose a post-decision state (PDS) based value iteration algorithm that exploits the underlying structure of the MDP. By separating action-controlled dynamics from exogenous factors, PDS enables faster convergence and efficient adaptive flow allocation, even in the absence of statistical knowledge about exogenous variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method converges faster and achieves lower long-term cost than standard Q-learning, highlighting the effectiveness of PDS-based RL for resource allocation in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Efficient LoRa with Low Complexity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a spectral-efficient LoRa (SE-LoRa) modulation scheme with a low complexity successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based detector. The proposed communication scheme significantly improves the spectral efficiency of LoRa modulation, while achieving an acceptable error performance compared to conventional LoRa modulation, especially in higher spreading factor (SF) settings. We derive the joint maximum likelihood (ML) detection rule for the SE-LoRa transmission scheme that turns out to be of high computational complexity. To overcome this issue, and by exploiting the frequency-domain characteristics of the dechirped SE-LoRa signal, we propose a low complexity SIC-based detector with a computation complexity at the order of conventional LoRa detection. By computer simulations, we show that the proposed SE-LoRa with low complexity SIC-based detector can improve the spectral efficiency of LoRa modulation up to $445.45\%$, $1011.11\%$, and $1071.88\%$ for SF values of $7$, $9$, and $11$, respectively, while maintaining the error performance within less than $3$ dB of conventional LoRa at symbol error rate (SER) of $10^{-3}$ in Rician channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Inter-Year Transfer of Altitude-Dependent Spectrum Activity Models Using Minimal Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the transferability of altitude-dependent spectrum activity models and measurements across years. We introduce a physics-informed, mean-only stochastic-geometry model of aggregate interference to altitude-binned received power, yielding three interpretable parameters for a given band and campaign: 1) line-of-sight transition slope, 2) transition altitude, and 3) effective activity constant. Analysis of aerial spectrum measurements collected from 2023 to 2025 across multiple sub-6 GHz bands reveals that downlink (DL) and shared-access bands preserve a persistent geometry-driven altitude structure that is stable across years. In contrast, uplink (UL) bands exhibit weak altitude dependence with no identifiable transition, indicating that interference is dominated by activity dynamics rather than propagation geometry. To quantify the practical limits of model reuse, we evaluate a minimal-calibration method in which the transition altitude is fixed from a reference year and the remaining parameters are estimated from only two altitude bins in the target year. The results further indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions for DL and CBRS bands, suggesting the feasibility of low-cost model transfer in stable environments, while highlighting the reduced applicability of mean-field models for UL scenarios.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff-Flux: Efficient Radio Map Construction via Generative Denoise Diffusion Model Trajectory Midpoint Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate radio map (RM) construction is essential to enabling environment-aware and adaptive wireless communication. However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Eco-WakeLoc: An Energy-Neutral and Cooperative UWB Real-Time Locating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization systems face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness, which is especially important for emerging use cases such as mobile robots operating in GPS-denied environments. Traditional RTLS either require continuously powered infrastructure, limiting their scalability, or are limited by their responsiveness. This work presents Eco-WakeLoc, designed to achieve centimeter-level UWB localization while remaining energy-neutral by combining ultra-low power wake-up radios (WuRs) with solar energy harvesting. By activating anchor nodes only on demand, the proposed system eliminates constant energy consumption while achieving centimeter-level positioning accuracy. To reduce coordination overhead and improve scalability, Eco-WakeLoc employs cooperative localization where active tags initiate ranging exchanges (trilateration), while passive tags opportunistically reuse these messages for TDOA positioning. An additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)-based energy-aware scheduler adapts localization rates according to the harvested energy, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the sensor network while ensuring long-term energy neutrality. The measured energy consumption is only 3.22mJ per localization for active tags, 951uJ for passive tags, and 353uJ for anchors. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot with nine anchors confirms the practical feasibility, achieving an average accuracy of 43cm in dynamic indoor environments. Year-long simulations show that tags achieve an average of 2031 localizations per day, retaining over 7% battery capacity after one year -- demonstrating that the RTLS achieves sustained energy-neutral operation. Eco-WakeLoc demonstrates that high-accuracy indoor localization can be achieved at scale without continuous infrastructure operation, combining energy neutrality, cooperative positioning, and adaptive scheduling.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity Region of Individual Key Rates in Vector Linear Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new insights into an open problem recently posed by Yuan-Sun [ISIT 2025], concerning the minimum individual key rate required in the vector linear secure aggregation problem. Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\mathbf{F}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\mathbf{G}[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\ldots,R_K) = (\mathbf{1}(1 \in \mathcal{I}),\ldots,\mathbf{1}(K\in \mathcal{I}))$, where $\mathcal{I}\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \textit{rank-increment condition}: $\mathrm{rank}\left(\bigl[\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}};\mathbf{G}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr]\right) =\mathrm{rank}\bigl(\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal{I}}\bigr)+N$. Here, $\mathbf{F}_\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathbf{G}_\mathcal{I}$ are the submatrices formed by the columns indexed by $\mathcal{I}$. Our results uncover the novel fact that it is not necessary for every user to hold a key, thereby strictly enlarging the best-known achievable region in the literature. Furthermore, we provide a converse analysis to demonstrate its optimality when minimizing the number of users that hold keys.</description>

      <title>Robust Egoistic Rigid Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a robust and self-reliant (or "egoistic") variation of the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which a primary rigid body seeks to estimate the pose (i.e., location and orientation) of another rigid body (or "target"), relative to its own, without the assistance of external infrastructure, without prior knowledge of the shape of the target, and taking into account the possibility that the available observations are incomplete. Three complementary contributions are then offered for such a scenario. The first is a method to estimate the translation vector between the center point of both rigid bodies, which unlike existing techniques does not require that both objects have the same shape or even the same number of landmark points. This technique is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art (SotA) under complete information, but to be sensitive to data erasures, even when enhanced by matrix completion methods. The second contribution, designed to offer improved performance in the presence of incomplete information, offers a robust alternative to the latter, at the expense of a slight relative loss under complete information. Finally, the third contribution is a scheme for the estimation of the rotation matrix describing the relative orientation of the target rigid body with respect to the primary. Comparisons of the proposed schemes and SotA techniques demonstrate the advantage of the contributed methods in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) performance under fully complete information and incomplete conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint BS Deployment and Power Optimization for Minimum EMF Exposure with RL in Real-World Based Urban Scenario</title>

Abstract: Base station (BS) deployment remains a critical task with successive wireless communication generations and increasing data rates demands, while the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is often underrated, yielding potential health implications. Therefore, this paper proposes a workflow that adjusts BS deployment and radiated power in a 3D urban scenario to jointly consider EMF exposure and coverage. To achieve this ambition, firstly, a novel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) tool is developed to improve computational efficiency, and simultaneously enhance diffraction modeling} for accurate EMF exposure calculation, validated with real-world measurements. To efficiently extend the computation across the target urban area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed based on the spatial stability of the effective channel while accounting for BS beamforming, enabling global estimation of EMF exposure and signal coverage. Subsequently, to better represent real-world communication network behaviors, the actual maximum transmit power, intercell interference, and channel state information imperfection are incorporated on the BS side, while mobility over the EMF exposure averaging interval is captured on the user equipment side. Upon the aforementioned aspects, the coverage-guaranteed EMF exposure minimization problem is formulated in a realistic and accurate manner, and solved by a geometry-aware algorithm adapted to deterministic channel models, yielding the optimal BS deployment and power configuration. In comparison to a baseline that relies on an empirical channel model, the proposed workflow delivers more reliable estimation of EMF exposure and provides practical guidance for BS construction and operations.</description>

      <title>BenchLink: An SoC-Based Benchmark for Resilient Communication Links in GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate timing and synchronization, typically enabled by GPS, are essential for modern wireless communication systems. However, many emerging applications must operate in GPS-denied environments where signals are unreliable or disrupted, resulting in oscillator drift and carrier frequency impairments. To address these challenges, we present BenchLink, a System-on-Chip (SoC)-based benchmark for resilient communication links that functions without GPS and supports adaptive pilot density and modulation. Unlike traditional General Purpose Processor (GPP)-based software-defined radios (e.g. USRPs), the SoC-based design allows for more precise latency control. We implement and evaluate BenchLink on Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in both ground and aerial environments. A comprehensive dataset has also been collected under various conditions. We will make both the SoC-based link design and dataset available to the wireless community. BenchLink is expected to facilitate future research on data-driven link adaptation, resilient synchronization in GPS-denied scenarios, and emerging applications that require precise latency control, such as integrated radar sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Secure Semantic Communications in the Age of Generative and Agentic AI: Threats and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems.</description>

      <title>Cyber Security of Sensor Systems for State Sequence Estimation: an AI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensor systems are extremely popular today and vulnerable to sensor data attacks. Due to possible devastating consequences, counteracting sensor data attacks is an extremely important topic, which has not seen sufficient study. This paper develops the first methods that accurately identify/eliminate only the problematic attacked sensor data presented to a sequence estimation/regression algorithm under a powerful attack model constructed based on known/observed attacks. The approach does not assume a known form for the statistical model of the sensor data, allowing data-driven and machine learning sequence estimation/regression algorithms to be protected. A simple protection approach for attackers not endowed with knowledge of the details of our protection approach is first developed, followed by additional processing for attacks based on protection system knowledge. In the cases tested for which it was designed, experimental results show that the simple approach achieves performance indistinguishable, to two decimal places, from that for an approach which knows which sensors are attacked. For cases where the attacker has knowledge of the protection approach, experimental results indicate the additional processing can be configured so that the worst-case degradation under the additional processing and a large number of sensors attacked can be made significantly smaller than the worst-case degradation of the simple approach, and close to an approach which knows which sensors are attacked, for the same number of attacked sensors with just a slight degradation under no attacks. Mathematical descriptions of the worst-case attacks are used to demonstrate the additional processing will provide similar advantages for cases for which we do not have numerical results. All the data-driven processing used in our approaches employ only unattacked training data.</description>
