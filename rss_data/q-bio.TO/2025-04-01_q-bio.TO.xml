      <title>The logarithmic relationship between mean arterial pressure and heart rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic heuristic formula for calculating the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in the human cardiac cycle using 1/3 of the systolic pressure (P_S) plus 2/3 of the diastolic pressure (P_D) importantly neglects the nonlinear effect of heart rate (HR) on blood pressure. Regression analysis on blood pressure data from patients experiencing a variety of heart rates captured a logarithmic relationship between mean arterial pressure and heart rate, F_S=0.086 *ln(HR-41.2)+0.079, where F_S is the MAP form factor corresponding to the fraction of time the cardiac cycle spends in ventricular systole. The logarithmic relationship is qualitatively distinct from the linear and exponential relationships previously suggested in the literature yet better aligns with the known human physiology. This heart rate-dependent formula for the mean arterial pressure recapitulates the classic intuition as a special case (HR=60bpm implies F_S =1/3). In addition, the model suggests several other MAP heuristics: HR=45bpm implies F_S = 1/5, HR=50bpm implies F_S = 1/4, HR=175bpm implies F_S = 1/2.

      <title>Simulating cell populations with explicit cell cycle length -- implications to cell cycle dependent tumour therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a stochastic simulation model designed to explicitly incorporate cell cycle length, overcoming limitations associated with classical compartmental models. Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by fitting it to experimental data from melanoma cell lines previously studied by Vittadello et al. Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.</description>

      <title>Heritable Nongenetic Information That is Independent of DNA and That Governs Organismal Development, Tissue Regeneration, and Tumor Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.01731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous studies of the tumor microenvironment, interspecies xenografting, and limb regeneration suggest the existence of a Tissue Spatial Code (TSC) that controls tissue structure in a quasi-epigenetic fashion. The term 'epigenetic' is an inadequate label for the concept that encompasses the TSC, because this information does not act upon DNA or chromatin via post-translational modifications (i.e. DNA methylation, histone acetylation). A broader term is needed to capture the diversity of three-dimensional (3D) spatial codes in biology. One such term is Heritable Nongenetic Information (HNI, pronounced 'honey'), which encompasses the TSC. The term 'heritable' is appropriate, because this information is passed onto offspring, otherwise it would have disappeared during evolution. Another reason for the heritability of HNI is that the spatial information observed in tissues is not reducible to the laws of physics, meaning structures like epithelial tubes or neural circuits do not spontaneously form in an aqueous solution; pre-existing physiological information in the microenvironment is necessary. In summary, HNI is defined as: heritable, instructional information that affects molecular-, cellular-, tissue-, or organ-level function without having to post-translationally modify DNA or chromatin in order to be inherited.</description>
