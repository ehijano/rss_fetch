      <title>Optimal Dosing Schedules for Substances Inducing Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many drugs used therapeutically or recreationally induce tolerance: the effect of the substance decreases with repeated use. This phenomenon may reduce the efficacy of the substance unless dosage is increased beyond what is healthy for the individual. Restoring the effect of the substance can often be obtained by taking a break from consumption. We propose designing dosing schedules that maximize the desired effect of the substance with a given total consumption, while factoring in the effect of tolerance. We provide a simple mathematical model of response to consumption and tolerance that can be fit from data on substance administration and response. Using this model with given parameters, we determine optimal consumption schedules to maximize a given objective. We illustrate with the example of caffeine, where we provide a schedule of consumption for a user who values the effects of caffeine on all days but needs extra alertness on some days of the week.</description>

      <title>Impulsive Lorenz semiflows: Physical measures, statistical stability and entropy stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semiflows generated via impulsive perturbations of Lorenz flows. We prove that such semiflows admit a finite number of physical measures. Moreover, if the impulsive perturbation is small enough, we show that the physical measures of the semiflows are close, in the weak* topology, to the unique physical measure of the Lorenz flow. A similar conclusion holds for the entropies associated with the physical measures.</description>

      <title>Zero Lyapunov Exponents in Transitive Skew-products of Iterated Function Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of transitive skew-products associated with iterated function systems of circle diffeomorphisms. We can approximate any transitive skew-product by maps in this class that have a robustly zero Lyapunov exponent. In particular, we prove the existence of non-hyperbolic ergodic measures for an open and dense subset of transitive skew-products. Moreover, these measures have full support and are the weak$^*$ limit of periodic measures.</description>

      <title>On a complex-analytic approach to classifying stationary measures on $S^1$ with respect to the countably supported measures on $PSU(1,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complex-analytic approach to the classification of positive stationary measures on $S^1$ with respect to complex finite Borel measures on $PSU(1,1)$ satisfying the finite first moment condition by studying their Poisson-like and Cauchy-like transforms from the perspective of generalized analytic continuation. This approach allows us to establish a functional-analytic criterion for singularity of a hitting measure for random walks on lattices in $PSU(1,1)$. In addition, this approach suggests alternative proofs to the several well-known related results by Furstenberg, Kaimanovich, Guivarc'h-le Jan and Bourgain, among several others.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoration, generalization, and dimensionality reduction of a vector field from samples are the most common and crucial tasks in dynamical system analysis. An optimization-based algorithm to fulfill these tasks is suggested. Given noisy, sparse, or redundant sampled vector fields, the optimization process encapsulates the inherent geometry of the dynamical system derived from the Koopman eigenfunction space. The dynamic geometry is revealed via the exact penalty method, compromising accuracy and smoothness. This algorithm is backed up by promising results of denoising and generalization with a concise dynamics representation leading to dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Decidability of the isomorphism problem between multidimensional substitutive subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important question in dynamical systems is the classification problem, i.e., the ability to distinguish between two isomorphic systems. In this work, we study the topological factors between a family of multidimensional substitutive subshifts generated by morphisms with uniform support. We prove that it is decidable to check whether two minimal aperiodic substitutive subshifts are isomorphic, under having the same combinatorial structure. The strategy followed in this work consists of giving a complete description of the factor maps between these subshifts. Then, we deduce some interesting consequences on coalescence, automorphism groups, and the number of aperiodic symbolic factors of substitutive subshifts. We also prove other combinatorial results on these substitutions, such as the decidability of defining a subshift, the computability of the recognizability radius, and the conjugacy between substitutions with different supports.</description>

      <title>Redefining fractals by Suzuki contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a significant effort in recent years to generalize the traditional concept of iterated function systems (IFS).In this article, we proposed Suzuki contraction in hyperspace and finding out the fixed point for Hutchinson mapping, which is called a deterministic fractal. The deterministic fractal for such a Suzuki contraction mapping is shown to exist and to be unique. We propose the Suzuki IFS (SIFS) in the literature for fractal creation based on this conclusion. Keywords: Fixed point, iterated function system, Suzuki contraction, Suzuki iterated function system, Attractor (Deterministic Fractal).</description>

      <title>SRB measures for partially hyperbolic systems with one-dimensional center subbundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a partially hyperbolic attractor with a center bundle splitting in a dominatedway into one-dimensional subbundles we show that for Lebesgue almost every point there is anempirical measure from $x$ with a SRB component. Moreover if the center exponents are nonzero, then $x$ lies in the basin of an ergodic hyperbolic SRB measure and there are only finitely many such measures. This gives another proof of the existence of SRB measures in this context, which was established  firstly in [11] by using random perturbations. Moreover this generalizes results of [15,18] which deal with a single one-dimensional center subbundle.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling of Stochastic Rotating Shallow Water Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, the authors have developed a generic methodology for calibrating the noise in fluid dynamics stochastic partial differential equations where the stochasticity was introduced to parametrize subgrid-scale processes. The stochastic parameterization of sub-grid scale processes is required in the estimation of uncertainty in weather and climate predictions, to represent systematic model errors arising from subgrid-scale fluctuations. The previous methodology used a principal component analysis (PCA) technique based on the ansatz that the increments of the stochastic parametrization are normally distributed.
  In this paper, the PCA technique is replaced by a generative model technique. This enables us to avoid imposing additional constraints on the increments. The methodology is tested on a stochastic rotating shallow water model with the elevation variable of the model used as input data. The numerical simulations show that the noise is indeed non-Gaussian. The generative modelling technology gives good RMSE, CRPS score and forecast rank histogram results.</description>

      <title>Tunable subdiffusion in the Caputo fractional standard map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Caputo fractional standard map (C-fSM) is a two-dimensional nonlinear map with memory given in action-angle variables $(I,\theta)$. It is parameterized by $K$ and $\alpha\in(1,2]$ which control the strength of nonlinearity and the fractional order of the Caputo derivative, respectively. In this work we perform a scaling study of the average squared action $\left&lt; I^2 \right&gt;$ along strongly chaotic orbits, i.e. when $K\gg1$. We numerically prove that $\left&lt; I^2 \right&gt;\propto n^\mu$ with $0\le\mu(\alpha)\le1$, for large enough discrete times $n$. That is, we demonstrate that the C-fSM displays subdiffusion for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. Specifically, we show that diffusion is suppressed for $\alpha\to1$ since $\mu(1)=0$, while standard diffusion is recovered for $\alpha=2$ where $\mu(2)=1$. We describe our numerical results with a phenomenological analytical estimation. We also contrast the C-fSM with the Riemann-Liouville fSM and Chirikov's standard map.</description>

      <title>Computational Seismic Fracture Synthesis of Tidal Barrage using Enhanced Isotropic Plasticity Damage Mechanics and Coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiphase Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mega-engineered hydraulic structures like dams and barrages are critically sensitive to strong ground motion if constructed within the vicinity of triggered fault lines. Collapse post excessive deformation leads to severe environmental impact. In this study, fracture corresponding to the response of a concrete tidal barrage to strong ground motion is analyzed along with behavioral effects due to reservoir-barrage dynamic interaction. An enhanced version of the plasticity damage mechanical model, which includes effects due to degradation of elastic stiffness of concrete as well as restoration of fracture energy losses is assigned as material behavior. The fluid-structure interaction is solved using an idealized Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. The proposed improvised numerical formulations are validated against benchmark simulations performed on the Koyna dam situated in Maharashtra, India and the results captured are upto 94% accurate. Finite element simulation of a tidal barrage is performed using a computationally stable mesh with global grid to length ratio of 4.2. The yield surface captured is elliptical in nature and fracture is observed to be propagating from bottom of gate housing covering upto four nodal integration points.</description>

      <title>From habitat decline to collapse: a spatially explicit approach connecting habitat degradation to destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitat loss, through degradation and destruction of viable habitat, has a well-documented and undeniable impact on the sustainability of ecosystems [Diaz et al. (2019), Pimm et al. (2014), Pimm et al. (2000)]. Moreover, most habitat loss is anthropogenic [Jacobson et al. (2019)]. Understanding the relationships between varying degrees of habitat degradation, movement strategies, and population dynamics on species persistence is crucial. We establish a robust connection between habitat degradation and destruction using a reaction-diffusion equation framework. Motivated by the recent work [Salmaniw et al. (2022)], we consider an intrinsic growth rate function that features a logistic-type growth in the viable habitat but decays at rate $c\geq0$ in the degraded region(s). In the limit as $c \to \infty$, the solution to the habitat degradation problem converges uniformly to the solution of a related habitat destruction problem. When the habitat destruction problem predicts deterministic extinction, a unique value $c_0$ exists, the extinction threshold, from which any further habitat degradation leads to deterministic extinction. This extinction threshold can be bounded below by a constant depending on the size of the degraded region and the habitat quality in the undisturbed region. To show these results, we investigate the eigenvalue problems related to each model formulation and establish a convergence result between the principal eigenvalues and their associated eigenfunctions, providing a precise analytical connection between habitat degradation and destruction in a general setting applicable to any species adopting diffusive movement strategies.</description>

      <title>Borel Complexity of the Isomorphism Relation of Archimedean Orders in Finitely Generated Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2020, Calderoni, Marker, Motto Ros and Shani asked what the Borel complexity of the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is. We answer this question by proving that the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is not hyperfinite when $n \geq 3$ and not treeable when $n \geq 4$. As a corollary, we get that the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is not hyperfinite when $n \geq 3$ and not treeable when $n \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Rate distortion dimension of random Brody curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to propose an ergodic theoretic approach to the study of entire holomorphic curves. Brody curves are one-Lipschitz holomorphic maps from the complex plane to the complex projective space. They naturally form a dynamical system, and "random Brody curves" in the title refers to invariant probability measures on it. We study their geometric and dynamical properties. Given an invariant probability measure $\mu$ on the space of Brody curves, our first main theorem claims that its rate distortion dimension is bounded by the integral of a "potential function" over $\mu$. This result is analogous to the Ruelle inequality of smooth ergodic theory. Our second main theorem claims that there exists a rich variety of invariant probability measures attaining equality in this "Ruelle inequality for Brody curves". The main tools of the proofs are the deformation theory of Brody curves and the variational principle for mean dimension with potential. This approach is motivated by the theory of thermodynamic formalism for Axiom A diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Approach for Rapid Detection of Aeroelastic Modes from Flutter Flight Test Based on Limited Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flutter flight test involves the evaluation of the airframes aeroelastic stability by applying artificial excitation on the aircraft lifting surfaces. The subsequent responses are captured and analyzed to extract the frequencies and damping characteristics of the system. However, noise contamination, turbulence, non-optimal excitation of modes, and sensor malfunction in one or more sensors make it time-consuming and corrupt the extraction process. In order to expedite the process of identifying and analyzing aeroelastic modes, this study implements a time-delay embedded Dynamic Mode Decomposition technique. This approach is complemented by Robust Principal Component Analysis methodology, and a sparsity promoting criterion which enables the automatic and optimal selection of sparse modes. The anonymized flutter flight test data, provided by the fifth author of this research paper, is utilized in this implementation. The methodology assumes no knowledge of the input excitation, only deals with the responses captured by accelerometer channels, and rapidly identifies the aeroelastic modes. By incorporating a compressed sensing algorithm, the methodology gains the ability to identify aeroelastic modes, even when the number of available sensors is limited. This augmentation greatly enhances the methodology's robustness and effectiveness, making it an excellent choice for real-time implementation during flutter test campaigns.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network method for the approximation of slow invariant manifolds for the general class of stiff systems of ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for the discovery of slow invariant manifolds (SIMs), for the most general class of fast/slow dynamical systems of ODEs. In contrast to other machine learning (ML) approaches that construct reduced order black box surrogate models using simple regression, and/or require a priori knowledge of the fast and slow variables, our approach, simultaneously decomposes the vector field into fast and slow components and provides a functional of the underlying SIM in a closed form. The decomposition is achieved by finding a transformation of the state variables to the fast and slow ones, which enables the derivation of an explicit, in terms of fast variables, SIM functional. The latter is obtained by solving a PDE corresponding to the invariance equation within the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT) using a single-layer feedforward neural network with symbolic differentiation. The performance of the proposed physics-informed ML framework is assessed via three benchmark problems: the Michaelis-Menten, the target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) reaction model and a fully competitive substrate-inhibitor(fCSI) mechanism. We also provide a comparison with other GPST methods, namely the quasi steady state approximation (QSSA), the partial equilibrium approximation (PEA) and CSP with one and two iterations. We show that the proposed PINN scheme provides SIM approximations, of equivalent or even higher accuracy, than those provided by QSSA, PEA and CSP, especially close to the boundaries of the underlying SIMs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the intertwining of Laguerre processes of parameter $\alpha$ in different dimensions.
  We introduce a Feller kernel that depends on $\alpha $ and intertwines the $\alpha$-Laguerre process in $N+1$ dimensions and that in $N$ dimensions.
  When $\alpha $ is a non-negative integer, the new kernel is interpreted in terms of the conditional distribution of the squared singular values: if the singular values of a unitarily invariant random matrix of order $(N+\alpha +1) \times (N+1)$ are fixed, then the those of its $(N+\alpha) \times N $ truncation matrix are given by the new kernel.</description>

      <title>Stochastic compartment model with mortality and its application to epidemic spreading in complex networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study epidemic spreading in complex networks by a multiple random walker approach. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a complex undirected (ergodic) random graph where we focus on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA), Erd\"os-R\'enyi (ER) and Watts-Strogatz (WS) types. Both, walkers and nodes can be either susceptible (S) or infected and infectious (I) representing their states of health. Susceptible nodes may be infected by visits of infected walkers, and susceptible walkers may be infected by visiting infected nodes. No direct transmission of the disease among walkers (or among nodes) is possible. This model mimics a large class of diseases such as Dengue and Malaria with transmission of the disease via vectors (mosquitos). Infected walkers may die during the time span of their infection introducing an additional compartment D of dead walkers. Infected nodes never die and always recover from their infection after a random finite time. We derive stochastic evolution equations for the mean-field compartmental populations with mortality of walkers and delayed transitions among the compartments. From linear stability analysis, we derive the basic reproduction numbers R M , R 0 with and without mortality, respectively, and prove that R M &lt; R 0 . For R M , R 0 &gt; 1 the healthy state is unstable whereas for zero mortality a stable endemic equilibrium exists (independent of the initial conditions) which we obtained explicitly. We observe that the solutions of the random walk simulations in the considered networks agree well with the mean-field solutions for strongly connected graph topologies, whereas less well for weakly connected structures and for diseases with high mortality.</description>

      <title>An Optimal-Control Approach to Infinite-Horizon Restless Bandits: Achieving Asymptotic Optimality with Minimal Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt an optimal-control framework for addressing the undiscounted infinite-horizon discrete-time restless $N$-armed bandit problem. Unlike most studies that rely on constructing policies based on the relaxed single-armed Markov Decision Process (MDP), we propose relaxing the entire bandit MDP as an optimal-control problem through the certainty equivalence control principle. Our main contribution is demonstrating that the reachability of an optimal stationary state within the optimal-control problem is a sufficient condition for the existence of an asymptotically optimal policy. Such a policy can be devised using an "align and steer" strategy. This reachability assumption is less stringent than any prior assumptions imposed on the arm-level MDP, notably the unichain condition is no longer needed. Through numerical examples, we show that employing model predictive control for steering generally results in superior performance compared to other existing policies.</description>

Abstract: Let $(X, T)$ be a topological dynamical system. We show that if each invariant measure of $(X, T)$ gives rise to a measure-theoretic dynamical system that is either: a. rigid along a sequence of "bounded prime volume" or b. admits a polynomial rate of rigidity on a linearly dense subset in $C(X)$, then $(X, T)$ satisfies Sarnak's conjecture on M\"obius disjointness. We show that the same conclusion also holds if there are countably many invariant ergodic measures, and each of them satisfies a. or b. This recovers some earlier results and implies Sarnak's conjecture in the following new cases: for almost every interval exchange map of $d$ intervals with $d \geq 2$, for $C^{2+\epsilon}$-smooth skew products over rotations and $C^{2+\epsilon}$-smooth flows (without fixed points) on the torus. In particular, these are improvements of earlier results of respectively Chaika-Eskin, Wang and Huang-Wang-Ye. We also discuss some purely arithmetic consequences for the Liouville function.</description>

Abstract: We show that for every non-elementary hyperbolic group, an associated topological flow space admits a coding based on a transitive subshift of finite type. Applications include regularity results for Manhattan curves, the uniqueness of measures of maximal Hausdorff dimension with potentials, and the real analyticity of intersection numbers for families of dominated representation, thus providing a direct proof of a result established by Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino in 2015.</description>

      <title>Solving the cohomological equation for locally hamiltonian flows, part I -- local obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomological equation $Xu=f$ for smooth locally Hamiltonian flows on compact surfaces. The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it is used to study the regularity of the solution $u$ when the flow has saddle loops, which has not been systematically studied before. Then we need to limit the flow to its minimum components. We show the existence and (optimal) regularity of solutions regarding the relations with the associated cohomological equations for interval exchange transformations (IETs). Our main theorems state that the regularity of solutions depends not only on the vanishing of the so-called Forni's distributions (cf.\ \cite{Fo1,Fo3}), but also on the vanishing of families of new invariant distributions (local obstructions) reflecting the behavior of $f$ around the saddles. Our main results provide some key ingredient for the complete solution to the regularity problem of solutions (in cohomological equations) for a.a.\ locally Hamiltonian flows (with or without saddle loops) to be shown in \cite{Fr-Ki3}.
  The main contribution of this article is to define the aforementioned new families of invariant distributions $\mathfrak{d}^k_{\sigma,j}$, $\mathfrak{C}^k_{\sigma,l}$ and analyze their effect on the regularity of $u$ and on the regularity of the associated cohomological equations for IETs. To prove this new phenomenon, we further develop local analysis of $f$ near degenerate singularities inspired by tools from \cite{Fr-Ki} and \cite{Fr-Ul2}. We develop new tools of handling functions whose higher derivatives have polynomial singularities over IETs.</description>

      <title>Morphological stability for in silico models of avascular tumors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of computational modeling in cancer systems biology is diverse, offering a spectrum of models and frameworks, each with its own trade-offs and advantages. Ideally, models are meant to be useful in refining hypotheses, to sharpen experimental procedures and, in the longer run, even for applications in personalized medicine. One of the greatest challenges is to balance model realism and detail with experimental data to eventually produce useful data-driven models. We contribute to this quest by developing a transparent, highly parsimonious, first principles silico model of a growing avascular tumor. We initially formulate the physiological considerations and the specific model within a stochastic cell-based framework. We next formulate a corresponding mean-field model using partial differential equations which is amenable to mathematical analysis. Despite a few notable differences between the two models, we are in this way able to successfully detail the impact of all parameters in the stability of the growth process and on the eventual tumor fate of the stochastic model. This facilitates the deduction of Bayesian priors for a given situation, but also provides important insights into the underlying mechanism of tumor growth and progression. Although the resulting model framework is relatively simple and transparent, it can still reproduce the full range of known emergent behavior. We identify a novel model instability arising from nutrient starvation and we also discuss additional insight concerning possible model additions and the effects of those. Thanks to the framework's flexibility, such additions can be readily included whenever the relevant data become available.</description>

Abstract: The increased difficulty in continuing to develop digital electronic logic has led to a renewal of interest in alternative approaches. In this work, we provide a model based on hyperdimensional computing for integrating oscillatory devices into larger computational systems. The expressiveness and compositionality of the underlying computing model allows oscillatory systems to implement both common tasks and novel functions, providing a computational role for many classes of emerging hardware devices. Furthermore, we detail the computational primitives of this system, prove how they can be executed via oscillatory systems, quantify the performance of these operations, and apply them to execute a graph compression task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a Wiener-Wintner dynamical system provides a simple proof of pointwise convergence for double recurrence in the case where the Wiener-Wintner averages converge to zero at a polynomial rate for a dense set of functions that lie outside the Kronecker factor. This follows by exploiting a bound that arises in the beginning of Bourgain argument for double recurrence. We extend this bound to triple and higher recurrence and define the notion of a higher order Wiener-Wintner dynamical system, in which pointwise convergence of higher recurrence follows by a similar simple argument. We provide examples of dynamical systems that satisfy this condition, and also show how the higher order Wiener-Wintner averaging condition can provide an alternative characterization of Host-Kra-Ziegler factors. We will also provide a proof of the return times theorem for multiple recurrence for this class of systems.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Modeling of Ecosystem Respiration via Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control Input</title>

Abstract: Ecosystem respiration (Reco) represents a major component of the global carbon cycle, and accurate characterization of its dynamics is essential for a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions and the impacts of climate extremes on the ecosystem. This paper presents a novel data-driven and physics-aware method for estimating Reco dynamics using the dynamic mode decomposition with control input (DMDc) technique, an emerging tool for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed model represents Reco as a state space model with an autonomous component and an exogenous control input. The control input can be any ecosystem driver(s), such as air temperature, soil temperature, or soil water content. This unique modeling approach allows controlled intervention to study the effects of different inputs on the system. Experimental results using Fluxnet2015 data show that the prediction accuracy of Reco dynamics achieved with DMDc is comparable to state-of-the-art methods, making it a promising tool for analyzing the dynamic behavior of different vegetation ecosystems on multi-temporal scales in response to different climatic drivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Trajectory Class Fluctuation Theorem (TCFT) substantially strengthens the Second Law of Thermodynamics -- that, in point of fact, can be a rather weak bound on resource fluxes. Practically, it improves empirical estimates of free energies, a task known to be statistically challenging, and has diagnosed successful and failed information processing in experimentally-implemented Josephson-junction information engines. The development here justifies that empirical analysis, explicating its mathematical foundations.
  The TCFT reveals the thermodynamics induced by macroscopic system transformations for each measurable subset of system trajectories. In this, it directly combats the statistical challenge of extremely rare events that dominate thermodynamic calculations. And, it reveals new forms of free energy -- forms that can be solved for analytically and practically estimated. Conceptually, the TCFT unifies a host of previously-established fluctuation theorems, interpolating from Crooks' Detailed Fluctuation Theorem (single trajectories) to Jarzynski's Equality (trajectory ensembles).</description>

Abstract: We prove the convergence of moments of the number of directions of affine lattice vectors that fall into a small disc, under natural Diophantine conditions on the shift. Furthermore, we show that the pair correlation function is Poissonian for any irrational shift in dimension 3 and higher, including well-approximable vectors. Convergence in distribution was already proved in the work of Str\"ombergsson and the second author, and the principal step in the extension to convergence of moments is an escape of mass estimate for averages over embedded $\operatorname{SL}(d,\mathbb{R})$-horospheres in the space of affine lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of neuron populations during many behavioural tasks evolve on low-dimensional manifolds. However, it remains challenging to discover latent representations from neural recordings that are interpretable and consistently decodable across individuals and conditions without explicitly relying on behavioural information. Here, we introduce MARBLE, a fully unsupervised geometric deep learning framework for the data-driven representation of non-linear dynamics based on statistical distributions of local dynamical features. Using both in silico examples from non-linear dynamical systems and recurrent neural networks and in vivo recordings from primates and rodents, we demonstrate that MARBLE can infer latent representations that are highly interpretable in terms of global system variables such as decision-thresholds, kinematics or internal states. We also show that MARBLE representations are consistent across neural networks and animals so that they can be used to compare cognitive computations or train universal decoders. Through extensive benchmarking, we show that unsupervised MARBLE provides best-in-class within- and across-animal decoding accuracy, comparable to or significantly better than current supervised approaches, yet without the need for behavioural labels. Our results suggest that using the manifold structure in conjunction with the temporal information of neural dynamics provides a common framework to develop better decoding algorithms and assimilate data across experiments.</description>

Abstract: A subgroup of $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is M\"obius-like if every element is conjugate to an element of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. In general, a M\"obius-like subgroup of $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is not necessarily (semi-)conjugate to a subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, as discovered by N. Kova\v{c}evi\'{c} [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 351 (1999), 4823-4835]. Here we determine simple dynamical criteria for the existence of such a (semi-)conjugacy. We show that M\"obius-like subgroups of $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ which are elementary (namely, preserving a Borel probability measure), are semi-conjugate to subgroups of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. On the other hand, we provide an example of elementary subgroup of $\mathrm{Diff}^\infty_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ satisfying that every non-trivial element fixes at most 2 points, which is not isomorphic to any subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Finally, we show that non-elementary, non-locally discrete subgroups acting with at most $N$ fixed points are conjugate to a dense subgroup of some finite central extension of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with a uniform version of amenability is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

Abstract: We give a complete description of the Poisson boundary of wreath products $A\wr B= \bigoplus_{B} A\rtimes B$ of countable groups $A$ and $B$, for probability measures $\mu$ with finite entropy where lamp configurations stabilize almost surely. If, in addition, the projection of $\mu$ to $B$ is Liouville, we prove that the Poisson boundary of $(A\wr B,\mu)$ is equal to the space of limit lamp configurations, endowed with the corresponding hitting measure. In particular, this answers an open question asked by Kaimanovich, and Lyons-Peres, for $B=\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\ge 3$, and measures $\mu$ with a finite first moment.</description>

Abstract: The modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the upper-half plane $\mathbb{HP}$ with quotient the modular orbifold, uniformized by the function $\mathfrak{j} \colon \mathbb{HP}\to \mathbb{C}$. We first show that second derived subgroup $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})''$ corresponds to a $\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/6$ Galois cover of the modular orbifold by a hexpunctured plane, uniformized by the hexponential map $\operatorname{hexp} \colon \mathbb{HP} \to \mathbb{C} \setminus (\omega_0\mathbb{Z}[j])$, which is a primitive of $C\eta^4$ where $\omega_0\in i\mathbb{R}$ and $C\in \mathbb{R}$ are explicit constants and $\eta$ is Dedekind eta function. We describe the values of the cusp-compactification $\partial \operatorname{hexp}\colon \mathbb{QP}^1\to \omega_0 \mathbb{Z}[j]$. After defining the radial-compactification $\operatorname{Shexp} \colon \mathscr{R} \to \mathbb{R}/(2\pi\mathbb{Z})$, we construct a simple section $\operatorname{InSh} \colon \mathbb{R}/(2\pi\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathscr{S} \bmod{\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})'}$ where $\mathscr{S} \subset \mathbb{RP}^1$ is a set of numbers whose continued fraction expansions arise from Sturmian sequences, which contains the set $\mathscr{M}$ of Markov quadratic irrationals as those numbers arising from periodic Sturmian sequences. We will show that the values of $\operatorname{InSh}$ are either Markov quadratic irrationals or transcendental. Finally we provide a continued fraction expansion for $\operatorname{hexp}$, and discuss its monodromy.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a continuous opinion and discrete action dynamics model coupled with an external observation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a set of consumers in a city or town (who thus generate pollution) whose opinion is governed by a continuous opinion and discrete action (CODA) dynamics model. This dynamics is coupled with an observation signal dynamics, which defines the information the consumers have access to regarding the common pollution. We show that the external observation signal has a significant impact on the asymptotic behavior of the CODA model. When the coupling is strong, it induces either a chaotic behavior or convergence towards a limit cycle. When the coupling is weak, a more classical behavior characterized by local agreements in polarized clusters is observed. In both cases, conditions under which clusters of consumers don't change their actions are provided.Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the derived analytical results.</description>
