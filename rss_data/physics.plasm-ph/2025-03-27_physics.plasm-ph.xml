      <title>An Energy-Efficient Atmospheric Plasma Jet Line Enabled by a Dielectric Microwave Anapole Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atmospheric pressure plasmas are crucial for applications in medicine, agriculture, and material processing, where their interaction with ambient air generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species for disinfection and treatment purposes. Additionally, their ability to alter carbon bonds makes them valuable for processing heat-sensitive materials and etching. Conventional resonant microwave plasma sources generate high electric fields for plasma production but are typically constrained to needle-like plasma configurations. Building on our earlier anapole plasma jet, we demonstrate a 2 cm line plasma jet for large-area surface treatment by leveraging the unique properties of the anapole source. With a uniform electric field of 106 V/m along the entire 2 cm length using just 1 W of input power, this highly efficient and compact PCB-compatible device enables stable plasma operation across a broad range of helium flow rates (1-40 slpm) and power levels (4-27 W). The anapole line plasma jet stands out for its high electron density, low operating temperature, and ease of frequency tunability, making it a promising platform for next-generation plasma applications.</description>

      <title>Flat-top electron velocity distributions driven by wave-particle resonant interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of kinetic electrons in the excitation and sustainment of ion-bulk electrostatic waves in collisionless plasmas is investigated, with a focus on the physical mechanisms responsible for the generation of small-scale structures in space plasmas. Building on the work of F. Valentini et al., PRL, 106, 165002 (2011), we numerically solve the Vlasov-Poisson system in one spatial and one velocity dimension for both ions and electrons. Our findings reveal that a significant fraction of the energy supplied by an external driving electric field, used to trigger ion-bulk waves excitation, is transferred to electrons, which become trapped within the wave potential well. As a result, multiple phase-space vortices, generated during the early time evolution, undergo a merging process in the long-time limit, ultimately resulting in a single, coherent, and persistent phase-space hole in the distributions of both species. Furthermore, the resonant interaction between electrons and ion-bulk fluctuations induces a velocity-space diffusion process, leading to the development of a "flat-top" profile in the electron velocity distribution, routinely observed in near Earth space. To establish observational relevance, virtual spacecraft measurements were performed to evaluate the detectability of the velocity distribution features observed in the simulations using modern spaceborne instruments. The results presented here are consistent with observations of electrostatic phenomena in space plasmas, and underscore the widespread occurrence of such structures across various plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Determination of non-local characteristics of density transport in 2D simulations of the SOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20468v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By use of Lagrangian tracers propagated on 2D simulations of Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) turbulence, we are able to determine the non-local fractional-advection, fractional-diffusion equation (FADE) coefficients for a number of equilibrium cases. Solutions of the resultant FADEs shows good agreement with the simulated mean density profiles. We detail how the FADE is derived: the stochastic flux equation is introduced, and it is shown how it is used to find general forms of Fick's first and second laws, dependent on the jump function. We show for spatially homogeneous jump functions which belong to the Levy-alpha Stable distribution that transport may be approximated by a non-local FADE with four parameters. This work demonstrates the sound basis for FADEs to act as reduced models of transport in systems dominated by coherent structures; so justifies the development of a first-principles approach to calculating FADE parameters.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>

      <title>The effect of shear flow on the resistive tearing instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new scaling theory for the resistive tearing mode instability of a current sheet with a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing flow shear and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic: both in the constant-$\Psi$ regime, as in previous results, but we also show that the growth rate is in fact suppressed more strongly in the nonconstant-$\Psi$ regime. As a consequence, for sufficiently large flow shear, the maximum of the growth rate is always affected by the shear suppression, and the wavenumber at which this maximum growth rate is attained is an increasing function of the strength of the flow shear. These results may be important for the onset of reconnection in imbalanced MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>Transition signatures for electron-positron pair creation in space-time inhomogeneous electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of electron-positron pair creation through multi-photon absorption in a space-time dependent electric field is analyzed using computational quantum field theory. Our findings reveal two distinct pair creation channels: the symmetric and asymmetric transition channels. We propose that the asymmetric transition channel arises from the inherent spatial inhomogeneity of intense laser pulses. By mapping the field-theoretical model of laser-assisted multi-photon pair creation onto a quantum-mechanical time-dependent framework, a semi-analytical solution that captures the asymmetric transition signatures of vacuum decay is derived. Additionally, it is demonstrated that neglecting spatial inhomogeneity leads to erroneous transition amplitudes and incorrect identification of pair creation channels. Furthermore, we have established that asymmetric transition channels substantially enhance the creation of electron-positron pairs for a given laser pulse energy.</description>

      <title>Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. This effect has not previously been seen. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases by the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence, resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the Erice Workshop: A new baseline for the hybrid, asymmetric, linear Higgs factory HALHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The HALHF collaboration has discussed a new baseline for the project, taking into account comments from the accelerator community on various aspects of the original design. In particular, these concerned the practicality of the dual-purpose linac to accelerate both colliding positron bunches and the drive beams required for the plasma linac. In addition, many other aspects of the project were also considered; the discussion and conclusions are documented in this paper. Finally, a new baseline is outlined that has been optimised and addresses several weaknesses in the original design, has higher luminosity, reduced centre-of-mass energy boost and additional features such as positron polarization as well as electron polarization. Although HALHF has become longer and more expensive, it remains significantly smaller and cheaper than other mature Higgs factory designs currently under discussion.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>
