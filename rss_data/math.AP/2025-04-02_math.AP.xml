      <title>Lipschitz stability in inverse problems for semi-discrete parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses an inverse problem for a semi-discrete parabolic equation, which consists of identifying the right-hand side of the equation based on solution measurements at an intermediate time and within a spatial subdomain. This result can be applied to establish a stability estimate for the spatially dependent potential function. Our approach relies on a novel semi-discrete Carleman estimate, whose parameter is constrained by the mesh size. As a consequence of the discrete terms arising in the Carleman inequality, this method naturally introduces an error term related to the solution's initial condition.</description>

      <title>A new monotonicity formula for quasilinear elliptic free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a monotonicity formula for a class of free boundary problems associated with the stationary points of the functional \[ J(u)=\int_\Omega F(|\nabla u|^2)+\mbox{meas}(\{u&gt;0\}\cap \Omega), \] where $F$ is a density function satisfying some structural conditions.
  The onus of proof lies with the careful analysis of the ghost function, the gradient part in the Helmholtz-W\'eyl decomposition of a nonlinear flux that appears in the domain variation formula for $J(u)$.
  As an application we prove full regularity for a class of quasilinear Bernoulli type free boundary problems in $\R^3$.</description>

      <title>A monotonicity formula for a classical free boundary problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a monotonicity formula for the free boundary problem of the form $\Delta u=\mu$, where $\mu$ is a Radon measure. It implies that the blow up limits of solutions are homogenous functions of degree one. The first formula is new even for classical Laplace operator.
  Our method of proof uses a careful application of the strong maximum principle.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness for the timelike minimal surface equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain improved local well-posedness results for the Lorentzian timelike minimal surface equation. In dimension $d=3$, for a surface of arbitrary co-dimension, we show a gain of $1/3$ derivative regularity compared to a generic equation of this type. The first result of this kind, going substantially beyond a general Strichartz threshold for quasilinear hyperbolic equations, was shown for minimal surfaces of co-dimension one with a gain of $1/4$ regularity by Ai-Ifrim-Tataru. We use a geometric formulation of the problem, relying on its parametric representation. The natural dynamic variables in this formulation are the parametrizing map, the induced metric and the second fundamental form of the immersion. The main geometric observation used in this paper is the Gauss (and Ricci) equation, dictating that the Riemann curvature of the induced metric (and the curvature of the normal bundle) can be expressed as the wedge product of the second fundamental form with itself. The second fundamental form, in turn, satisfies a wave equation with respect to the induced metric. Exploiting the problem's diffeomorphism freedom, stemming from the non-uniqueness of the parametrization, we introduce a new gauge - a choice of a coordinate system on the parametrizing manifold - in which the metric recovers the full regularity of its Riemann curvature, including the crucial $L^1L^\infty$ estimate for the first derivatives of the metric. Analysis of minimal surfaces with co-dimension bigger than one requires that we impose and take advantage of an additional special gauge on the normal bundle of the surface. The proof also uses both the additional structure contained in the wedge product and the Strichartz estimates with losses developed earlier in the context of a well-posedness theory for quasilinear hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Nishida-Smoller type large solutions for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions in 3D exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the global existence of classical solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary condition in a three-dimensional (3D) exterior domain. It is shown that the classical solutions with large initial energy and vacuum exist globally in time when the adiabatic exponent $\gamma&gt;1$ is sufficiently close to 1 (near-isothermal regime). This constitutes an extension of the celebrated result for the one-dimensional Cauchy problem of the isentropic Euler equations that has been established in 1973 by Nishida and Smoller (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 26 (1973), 183-200). To the best of our knowledge, we establish the first result on the global existence of large-energy solutions with vacuum to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary condition in a 3D exterior domain, which improves previous related works where either small initial energy is required or boundary effects are ignored.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence to the equilibrium of the homogeneous Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac Equation with moderately soft potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We concern the long-time behavior of mild solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation with moderately soft potential. Based on the well-posedness results in [X-G. Lu, J. Stat. Phys., 105, (2001), 353-388], we prove that the mild solution decays algebraically to the Fermi--Dirac statistics with an explicit rate. Under the framework of the level set analysis by De Giorgi, we derive an $L^\infty$ estimate which is uniform with respect to the quantum parameter $\varepsilon$. All quantitative estimates are independent of $\varepsilon$, which implies that they also hold in the classical limit, i.e., the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an Interconnected SDE -Parabolic PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a controller for an interconnected system where a linear Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is actuated through a linear parabolic heat equation. These dynamics arise in various applications, such as coupled heat transfer systems and chemical reaction processes that are subject to disturbances. Our goal is to develop a computational method for approximating the controller that minimizes a quadratic cost associated with the state of the SDE component. To achieve this, we first perform a change of variables to shift the actuation inside the PDE domain and reformulate the system as a linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE). We use a spectral approximation of the Laplacian operator to discretize the coupled dynamics into a finite-dimensional SDE and compute the optimal control for this approximated system. The resulting control serves as an approximation of the optimal control for the original system. We then establish the convergence of the approximated optimal control and the corresponding closed-loop dynamics to their infinite-dimensional counterparts. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator associated with multi-layer structures and analysis of plasmon mode splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing electostatics within multi-layer metamaterial structures. The multi-layer structure can be designed by nesting complementary negative and regular materials together, and it can be easily achieved by truncating bulk metallic material in a specific configuration. Using layer potentials and symmetrization techniques, we establish the perturbation formula in terms of Neumann-Poincar\'e (NP) operator for general multi-layered medium, and obtain the spectral properties of the NP operator, which demonstrates that the number of plasmon modes increases with the number of layers. Based on Fourier series, we present an exact matrix representation of the NP operator in an apparently unsymmetrical structure, exemplified by multi-layer confocal ellipses. By highly intricate and delicate analysis, we establish a handy algebraic framework for studying the splitting of the plasmon modes within multi-layer structures. Moreover, the asymptotic profiles of the plasmon modes are also obtained. This framework helps reveal the effects of material truncation and rotational symmetry breaking on the splitting of the plasmon modes, thereby inducing desired resonances and enabling the realization of customized applications.</description>

Abstract: We establish a shape-derivative formula for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on a compact manifold. Then, we apply this formula to obtain the well-posedness in H 1 under a specific Rayleigh-Taylor condition to an equation describing cell protrusions. This equation is a generalisation of the theoretical part of [9] to any -2D as well as 3D-surfaces.</description>

      <title>From indirect to direct taxis by fast reaction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many ecological population models consider taxis as the directed movement of animals in response to a stimulus. The taxis is named direct if the animals are guided by the density gradient of some other population or indirect if they are guided by the density of a chemical secreted by individuals of the other population. Let $u$ and $v$ denote the densities of two populations and $w$ the density of the chemical secreted by individuals in the $v$ population. We consider a bounded, open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with regular boundary and prove that for the space dimension $N\leq 2$ the solution to the Lotka-Volterra competition model with repulsive indirect taxis and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions
  $$u_t - d_u\Delta u = \chi \nabla \cdot u \nabla w +\mu_1u(1-u-a_1v)\,,$$
  $$ v_t - d_v\Delta v = \mu_2v(1-v-a_2u)\,,$$
  $$\varepsilon ( w_t - d_w\Delta w )= v- w\, , $$ converges to the solution of repulsive direct-taxis model: $$ u_t - d_u\Delta u = \chi \nabla \cdot u \nabla v +\mu_1u(1-u-a_1v)\,,$$ $$ v_t - d_v\Delta v = \mu_2v(1-v-a_2u)\,$$ when $\varepsilon\longrightarrow 0$. For space dimension $N\geq 3$ we use the compactness argument to show that the result holds in some weak sense. A similar result is also proved for a typical prey-predator model with prey taxis and logistic growth of predators.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation from multiple eigenvalues of rotating traveling waves on a capillary liquid drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free boundary problem for a liquid drop of nearly spherical shape with capillarity, and we study the existence of nontrivial (i.e., non spherical) rotating traveling profiles bifurcating from the spherical shape, where the bifurcation parameter is the angular velocity. We prove that every eigenvalue of the linearized problem is a bifurcation point, extending the known result for simple eigenvalues to the general case of eigenvalues of any multiplicity. We also obtain a lower bound on the number of bifurcating solutions. The proof is based on the Hamiltonian structure of the problem and on the variational argument of constrained critical points for traveling waves of Craig and Nicholls (2000, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 32, 323-359), adapted to the nearly spherical geometry; in particular, the role of the action functional is played here by the angular momentum with respect to the rotation axis. Moreover, the bifurcation equation presents a 2-dimensional degeneration, related to some symmetries of the physical problem. This additional difficulty is overcome thanks to a crucial transversality property, obtained by using the Hamiltonian structure and the prime integrals corresponding to those symmetries by Noether theorem, which are the fluid mass and the component along the rotation axis of the velocity of the fluid barycenter.</description>

      <title>Classification of the minimal-mass blowup solutions to the two dimensional focusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the two dimensional focusing finitely and infinitely coupled cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger system when the mass is equal to the scattering threshold. For the focusing finitely coupled cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger system, we present a complete classification of minimal-mass blowup solutions. Specifically, we demonstrate that all such solutions must be either solitons or their pseudo-conformal transformations. To prove this result, we develop a modulation analysis that accounts for multi-component interactions to overcome the multiply phase transformations caused by the multi-component. A long time Strichartz estimate for vector-valued solutions is established to solve the difficulty posed by the Galilean transformations and spatial translation, where a new vector-valued bilinear estimate is proven to address the challenges caused by the coupled nonlinear interaction. For the infinitely coupled focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger system when the mass is slightly above the scattering threshold in \cite{CGHY}, we show that scattering is the only dynamical behavior of the solutions to the infinitely coupled system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the radiative Vlasov-Maxwell equations, the Lorentz force is modified by the addition of radiation reaction forces. The radiation forces produce damping of particle energy but the forces are no longer divergence-free in momentum space, which has an effect of concentration to zero momentum. We prove unconditional global regularity of solutions for a class of radiative Vlasov-Maxwell equations with large initial data.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of coefficients in the double phase problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to reconstruct the nonnegative coefficient $a$ in the double phase problem $\mathrm{div}\,(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u+a|\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u)=0$ in a domain $\Omega$, $u=f$ on $\partial\Omega$, from the Dirichlet to Neumann (DN) map $\Lambda_a$. We show that this can be achieved, when the coefficient $a$ has H\"older continuous first order derivatives and the exponents satisfy $1&lt;p\neq q&lt;\infty$. Our reconstruction method relies on a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the solution $u$ to the double phase problem with small or large Dirichlet datum $f$ (depending on the ordering of $p$ and $q$) as well as the related DN map $\Lambda_a$. As is common for inverse boundary value problems, we need a sufficiently rich family of special solutions to a related partial differential equation, which is independent of the coefficient one aims to reconstruct (in our case to the $p$-Laplace equation). We construct such families of solutions by a suitable linearization technique.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the Coriolis force on the enstrophy cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the direct enstrophy cascade at small spatial scales in statistically stationary forced-dissipated 2D Navier-Stokes equations subject to the Coriolis force in the $\beta$-plane approximation. We provide sufficient conditions inspired by [6,63] to prove that at small scales, in the presence of the Coriolis force, the so-called third-order structure function's asymptotics follows the third-order universal law of 2D turbulence without the Coriolis force. Our result indicates that at small scales, the enstrophy flux from larger to smaller scales is not affected by the Coriolis force, confirming experimental and numerical observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mathematically rigorous study of the above equations.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of a nonlinear PDE model for ant trail formation, which was introduced in [3]. We establish the existence of a compact global attractor and prove the nonlinear instability of the homogeneous steady state under an inviscid instability condition. We also provide a dimensional lower bound on the attractor. Alternatively, we prove that if the interaction parameter is sufficiently small, the homogeneous steady state is globally asymptotically stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results in quantitative homogenisation of the wave equation with rapidly oscillating coefficients are discussed from the operator-theoretic perspective, which views the solution as the result of applying the operator of hyperbolic dynamics, i.e. the unitary group of a self-adjoint operator on a suitable Hilbert space. A prototype one-dimensional example of utilising the framework of Ryzhov boundary triples is analysed, where operator-norm resolvent estimates for the problem of classical moderate-contrast homogenisation are obtained. By an appropriate "dilation" procedure, these are shown to upgrade to second-order (and more generally, higher-order) estimates for the resolvent and the unitary group describing the evolution for the related wave equation.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of entropy solutions to stochastic degenerate parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of entropy solutions for quasilinear parabolic equations with anisotropic degeneracy and stochastic forcing. Building on previous works, we establish space-time regularity under a non-degeneracy condition that does not require an assumption on the derivative of the symbol of the corresponding kinetic equation, a restriction imposed in earlier studies. This allows us to obtain regularity results for certain equations not accounted for by prior theory, albeit with reduced regularity exponents. Our approach uses a kinetic formulation with two transport equations, one of second order and one of first order, leveraging a form of "parabolic regularity" inherent in these equations that was not utilized in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In harmonic analysis, the studies of inequalities of classical operators (= singular, maximal, Riesz potentials etc.) in various function spaces have a very important place. The maturation of many topics in the field of harmonic analysis, as a result of various needs and developments to respond to the problems of the time, has also led to the emergence of many studies and works on these topics. In [3], under some conditions, the boundedness of Riesz potential on homogeneous variable exponent Herz-Morrey-Hardy spaces has been given. Inspired by the work of [3], in this work, by the atomic decompositions, we obtain the boundedness of commutators generated by the Riesz potentials on homogeneous variable exponent Herz-Morrey-Hardy spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown in [Yang-Yu 2019] that general large solutions to the Cauchy problem for the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system (MKG) in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ decay like linear solutions. One hence can define the associated radiation field on the future null infinity as the limit of $(r\underline{\alpha}, r\phi)$ along the out going null geodesics. In this paper, we show the existence of a global solution to the MKG system which scatters to any given sufficiently localized radiation field with arbitrarily large size and total charge. The result follows by studying the characteristic initial value problem for the MKG system with general large data by using gauge invariant vector field method. We in particular extend the small data result of He in \cite{MR4299134} to a class of general large data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the characteristic initial value problem for a class of nonlinear wave equations with data on a conic light cone in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$. We show the existence of local solution for a class of singular initial data in the sense that the standard energy could be infinite and the solution may blow up at the conic point. As an application, we improve our previous result on the inverse scattering problem for the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations with scattering data on the future null infinity.</description>

      <title>Kermack-McKendrick type models for epidemics with nonlocal aggregation terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach to model spatial heterogeneity in SIR-type models for the spread of epidemics via \emph{nonlocal aggregation terms}. More precisely, we first consider an SIR model with spatial movements driven by nonlocal aggregation terms, in which the inter-compartment and intra-compartment interaction terms are distinct, and modelled through smooth interaction kernels. For the Cauchy problem of said model we provide a full well-posedness theory on $\R^2$ for $L^1\cap L^\infty \cap H^1$ initial conditions. The existence part is achieved by considering an approximated model with artificial linear diffusion, for which existence and uniqueness is proven via Duhamel's principle and Banach fixed point, and by providing suitable uniform estimates on the approximated solution in order to pass to the limit via classical compactness techniques. To prove uniqueness, we use classical $L^2$-stability which relies on the $H^1$-regularity of the solution. In the second part of the paper we provide a brief, general discussion on the steady states for these type of models, and display a specific example of non-trivial steady states for an SIS model with aggregations (driven by a single repulsive-attractive potential), the existence of which is determined by a threshold condition for a suitable "space-dependent" basic reproduction rate. We complement the analysis with numerical simulations on the SIS model.</description>

      <title>Hardy's Uncertainty principle for Schr\"odinger equations with quadratic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardy's uncertainty principle is a classical result in harmonic analysis, stating that a function in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and its Fourier transform cannot both decay arbitrarily fast at infinity. In this paper, we extend this principle to the propagators of Schr\"odinger equations with quadratic Hamiltonians, known in the literature as metaplectic operators. These operators generalize the Fourier transform and have captured significant attention in recent years due to their wide-ranging applications in time-frequency analysis, quantum harmonic analysis, signal processing, and various other fields. However, the involved structure of these operators requires careful analysis, and most results obtained so far concern special propagators that can basically be reduced to rescaled Fourier transforms. The main contributions of this work are threefold: (1) we extend Hardy's uncertainty principle, covering all propagators of Schr\"odinger equations with quadratic Hamiltonians, (2) we provide concrete examples, such as fractional Fourier transforms, which arise when considering anisotropic harmonic oscillators, (3) we suggest Gaussian decay conditions in certain directions only, which are related to the structure of the corresponding symplectic projection.</description>

      <title>Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics Around Couette Flow: Long Time Stability and Vorticity-Current Instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers the ideal 2D magnetohydrodynamic equations on an infinite periodic channel close to a combination of an affine shear flow, called Couette flow, and a constant magnetic field. This setting combines important physical effects of mixing and coupling of velocity and magnetic field. We establish the existence and stability of the velocity and magnetic field for Gevrey-class perturbations of size $\varepsilon$, valid up to times $t \sim \varepsilon^{-1}$. Additionally, the vorticity and current grow as $O(t)$ and there is no inviscid damping of the velocity and magnetic field. This has parallels to the above threshold case for the $3D$ Navier-Stokes \cite{bedrossian2022dynamics} where growth in `streaks' leads to time scales of $t\sim \varepsilon^{-1}$. In particular, for the ideal MHD equations, our article suggests that for a wide range of initial data, the scenario ``dynamo effect $\Rightarrow $ vorticity and current growth $\Rightarrow $ vorticity and current breakdown'' leads to instability and possible turbulences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with a Hamiltonian of the form $H=-\Delta+i(A \nabla + \nabla A) + V$, which includes a magnetic potential $A$, has the same dispersive and solution decay properties as the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In particular, we prove $L^1 \to L^\infty$ decay and some related estimates for the wave equation.
  The potentials $A$ and $V$ are short-range and $A$ has four derivatives, but they can be arbitrarily large. All results hold in three space dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We establish $L^p$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem, for some finite $p$, in a 1-sided chord-arc domain $\Omega$ (i.e., a uniform domain with Ahlfors-David regular boundary), for elliptic equations of the form \[ Lu=-\text{div}(A\nabla u) + {\bf B}\cdot \nabla u=:L_0 u+ {\bf B}\cdot \nabla u=0, \] given that the analogous result holds (typically with a different value of $p$) for the homogeneous second order operator $L_0$. Essentially, we assume that $|{\bf B}(X)|\lesssim \text{dist}(X,\partial \Omega)^{-1}$, and that $|{\bf B}(X)|^2\text{dist}(X,\partial \Omega) dX$ is a Carleson measure in $\Omega$.</description>

Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the theoretical study on the decay rate of the solution to the null one when a localized damping acts.</description>

      <title>Sharp Boundary Estimates and Harnack Inequalities for Fractional Porous Medium type Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides sharp quantitative and constructive estimates of nonnegative solutions $u(t,x)\geq 0$ to the nonlinear fractional diffusion equation, $$\partial_t u +{\mathcal L} F(u)=0,$$ also known as filtration equation, posed in a smooth bounded domain $x\in \Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^N$ with suitable homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Both the operator ${\mathcal L}$ and the nonlinearity $F$ belong to a general class. The assumption on ${\mathcal L}$ are set in terms of the kernel of ${\mathcal L}$ and/or ${\mathcal L}^{-1}$, and allow for operators with degenerate kernel at the boundary of $\Omega$. The main examples of ${\mathcal L}$ are the three different Dirichlet Fractional Laplacians on bounded domains, and the nonlinearity can be non-homogeneous, for instance, $F(u)=u^2+u^{10}$. Previous result were known in the porous medium case, i.e. $F(u)=|u|^{m-1} u$ with $m&gt;1$. Our aim here is to perform the next step: a delicate analysis of regularity through quantitative, constructive and sharp a priori estimates. Our main results are global Harnack type inequalities $$H_0(t,u_0)\, {\rm dist}(x, \partial \Omega)^a\leq F(u(t,x))\leq H_1(t)\, {\rm dist}(x, \partial \Omega)^b\qquad\forall (t,x)\in (0,\infty)\times \overline{\Omega},$$ where the expressions of $H_0, H_1$ and $a,b$ are explicit and may change according to ${\mathcal L}$ and $F$. The sharpness of such estimates is proven by means of examples and counterexamples: on the one hand, we can match the powers (i.e. $a=b$) when the operator has a non degenerate kernel. On the other hand, when ${\mathcal L}$ has a kernel that degenerates at the boundary $\partial\Omega$, there appear an intriguing anomalous boundary behaviour: the size of the initial data determines the sharp boundary behaviour of the solution, different for ``small'' and ``large'' initial data. We conclude the paper with higher regularity results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of small and large solutions to a broad class of nonlinear Dirac-type equations. Our results are classified in 1D massless and massive cases, 3D general and $n$ dimensional in generality. In the 1D massless case we prove that any globally defined solution converges to zero as time tends to infinity, within a spatial region expanding at a rate proportional to $ t \log^{-2} t$. This result holds without assumptions on the smallness of initial data or specific power of nonlinearity, ruling out the existence of standing breather-like or solitary wave structures in this regime. In the 1D massive case, solitary waves are known to exist. Introducing new virial identities adapted to the Dirac's distinctive algebra, we prove that there are ``holomorphic'' odd nonlinearities under which globally defined small odd solutions decay to zero on spatial compact sets as time tends to infinity. This result is extended to the 3D case under boundedness of the $H^1$ norm but without requiring the parity condition on the data, giving decay proofs for an important class of nonlinear Dirac models, and opening the door to the future use of virial identities to prove asymptotic stability of well-chosen Dirac solitary waves.
  Finally, in higher dimensions $ n \geq 1$, we prove the $L^2$ decay for global solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations in the ``exterior light-cone'' region. This confirms the non-existence of breathers and other solutions propagating faster than the speed of light. Our proofs rely on carefully constructed weighted virial identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half plane $\mathbb{R}^2_+$. There are several conditions on the behavior of the matrix $A$ in the transversal $t$-direction that yield $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$. These include the $t$-independence condition, a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition on $\partial_t A$, and Dini-type conditions. We introduce an $L^1$ Carleson condition on $\partial_t A(x,t)$ that extends the class of elliptic operators for which we have $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$, i.e. solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for some $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$.</description>

Abstract: Given a general scalar balance law, i.e., in several space dimensions and with flux and source both space and time dependent, we focus on the functional properties of the entropy production. We apply this operator to entropy solutions, to distributional solutions or to merely L $\infty$ functions. Proving its analytical properties naturally leads to the projective tensor product of C 1 spaces and to further natural extensions to space and time dependent or complex valued ''entropies''. Besides various qualitative properties, this extended framework allows to obtain new quantitative formulae -also by means of Fourier transforms -that provide different representations of the entropy production. Remarkably, this operator also furnishes a faithful representation of any L $\infty$ function.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for the Bakry-\'Emery Laplacian on manifolds with boundary -- uniqueness and non-uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the questions of uniqueness and non-uniqueness for a pair of closely related inverse problems for the Bakry-\'Emery Laplacian $-\Delta_{\mathcal E}$ on a smooth compact and oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary $(\overline{M},g)$, endowed with a volume form $\mathfrak{m}=e^{-V}\omega_g$. These consist in recovering the Taylor coefficients of metric $g$ and weight $V$ along the boundary of $\overline{M}$ from the knowledge of a pair of operators that can be viewed as geometrically natural Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps associated to $-\Delta_{\mathcal E}$.</description>

      <title>Evolving convex curves by a generalized length-preserving flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a generalized length-preserving flow for convex curves in the plane. It is shown that the flow exists globally and deforms convex curves into circles as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and non-existence results for collapsed translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a rigidity result for mean curvature self-translating solitons, characterizing the grim reaper cylinder as the only finite entropy self-translating 2-surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of width $\pi$ and bounded from below. The proof makes use of parabolicity in a weighted setting applied to a suitable universally $L$-superharmonic function defined on translaters in such slabs.</description>

      <title>Resolvents of Bochner Laplacians in the semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of pseudodifferential operators, called Heisenberg semiclassical pseudodifferential operators, to study the space of sections of a power of a line bundle on a compact manifold, in the limit where the power is large. This class contains the Bochner Laplacian associated with a connection of the line bundle, and when the curvature is nondegenerate, its resolvent and some associated spectral projections, including generalized Bergman kernels.</description>
