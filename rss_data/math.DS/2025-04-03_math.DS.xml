      <title>Minimality of Strong Foliations of Anosov and Partially Hyperbolic Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of expanding invariant foliations of $C^{1+}$ diffeomorphisms, in the context of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and laminations with $1$-dimensional center bundle.
  In this first version of the paper, we introduce a property we call *s-transversality* of a partially hyperbolic lamination with $1$-dimensional center bundle, which is robust under $C^1$ perturbations. We prove that under a weak expanding condition on the center bundle (called *some hyperbolicity*, or "SH"), any s-transverse partially hyperbolic lamination contains a disk tangent to the center-unstable direction (Theorem C).
  We obtain several corollaries, among them: if $f$ is a $C^{1+}$ partially hyperbolic Anosov diffeomorphism with $1$-dimensional expanding center, and the (strong) unstable foliation $W^{uu}$ of $f$ is minimal, then $W^{uu}$ is robustly minimal under $C^1$-small perturbations, provided that the stable and strong unstable bundles are not jointly integrable (Theorem B).
  Theorem B has applications in our upcoming work with Eskin, Potrie and Zhang, in which we prove that on ${\mathbb T}^3$, any $C^{1+}$ partially hyperbolic Anosov diffeomorphism with $1$-dimensional expanding center has a minimal strong unstable foliation, and has a unique $uu$-Gibbs measure provided that the stable and strong unstable bundles are not jointly integrable.
  In a future work, we address the density (in any $C^r$ topology) of minimality of strong unstable foliations for $C^{1+}$ partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with $1$-dimensional center and the SH property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article characterizes phase transitions in temperature within a specific space of H\"older continuous potentials, distinguished by their regularity and asymptotic behavior at zero. We also characterize the phase transitions in temperature that are robust within this space. Our results reveal a connection between phase transitions in temperature and ergodic optimization.</description>

      <title>A Partial Characterization of Cosine Thurston Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce cosine Thurston maps. In particular, we construct postsingularly finite topological cosine maps and focus on such maps with strictly preperiodic critical points. We use the techniques of Hubbard, Schleicher, and Shishikura to prove that, subject to a condition on the critical points, a postsingularly finite topological cosine map with strictly preperiodic critical points is combinatorially equivalent to $C_\lambda(z) = \lambda \cos z$ for a unique $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}^*$ if only if it has no degenerate Levy cycle.</description>

      <title>The Poisson boundary of Thompson's group $T$ is not the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate probability measure with finite entropy on a countable group $G \leq \mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle acting proximally, minimally and topologically nonfreely on $S^1$. We prove that the circle $S^1$ endowed with its unique $\mu$-stationary probability measure is not the Poisson boundary of $(G,\mu)$. When $G$ is Thompson's group $T$ and $\mu$ is finitely supported, this answers a question posed by B. Deroin [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 2013] and A. Navas [Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, 2018].</description>

      <title>Biological network dynamics: Poincar\'e-Lindstedt series and the effect of delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the Hopf bifurcation in an activator-inhibitor system without diffusion which can be modeled as a delay differential equation. The main result of this paper is the existence of the Poincar\'e-Lindstedt series to all orders for the bifurcating periodic solutions. The model has a non-linearity which is non-polynomial, and yet this allows us to exploit the use of Fourier-Taylor series to develop order-by-order calculations that lead to linear recurrence equations for the coefficients of the Poincar\'e-Lindstedt series. As applications, we implement the computation of the coefficients of these series for any finite order, and use a pseudo-arclength continuation to compute branches of periodic solutions.</description>

      <title>Coarse chain recurrence, Morse graphs with finite errors, and persistence of circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In flow control, finite energy may be injected to push out material trapped in the attractor and to eliminate stagnation and circulate the flow. To describe such phenomena and to give a lower bound on the energy required, we generalize the existing concepts of chain recurrence. In fact, this paper introduces concepts of ``coarse chain recurrences'' and Morse graphs with finite errors. Using these concepts, we describe toy models of escape from attracting basins and elimination of stagnation by controls using finite energy, persistence of recurrent points, and singular limit behaviors where energy injections go to zero. Furthermore, we construct filtrations associated with dynamical systems, which indicate the persistence of circulations.</description>

      <title>Structural stability in piecewise M\"obius transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural stability of piecewise M\"obius transformations (PMTs) is investigated from several angles. A result about structural stability restricted to the space of PMTs is obtained using hyperbolic features for the component functions and the pre-singularities set, allowing a holomorphic motion. Is it defined and analyzed for PMTs the analogous concept of J-stabilty for rational maps, finding some relations with the general structural stability. The notions of hyperbolic and expansive PMTs are defined, showing that they are not equivalent and none of them implies structural stability. Combining the previous results and analyzes, sufficient conditions are given for structural stability. Finally, an example of structural stability in the complexified tent maps family is shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability and exponential stability of a class of impulsive neutral differential equations with discrete and distributed delays. Our approaches are based on the method using fixed point theory, which do not resort to any Lyapunov functions or Lyapunov functionals. Our conditions do not require the differentiability of delays, nor do they ask for a fixed sign on the coefficient functions. Our results improve some previous ones in the literature. Examples are given to illustrate our main results.</description>

      <title>Height arguments toward the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use height arguments to prove two results about the dynamical Mordell-Lang problem. We are more interested in the positive characteristic case due to our original purpose.
  (i) For an endomorphism of a projective variety, the return set of a dense orbit into a curve is finite if any cohomological Lyapunov exponent of any iteration is not an integer.
  (ii) Let $f\times g:X\times C\rightarrow X\times C$ be an endomorphism in which $f$ and $g$ are endomorphisms of a projective variety $X$ and a curve $C$, respectively. If the degree of $g$ is greater than the first dynamical degree of $f$, then the return sets of the system $(X\times C,f\times g)$ have the same form as the return sets of the system $(X,f)$.
  Using the second result, we deal with the case of split endomorphisms of products of curves, for which the degrees of the factors are pairwise distinct.
  In the cases that the height argument cannot be applied, we find examples which show that the return set can be very complicated -- more complicated than experts once imagine -- even for endomorphisms of tori of zero entropy.</description>

      <title>Limit cycles bifurcating from the quasi-homogeneous polynomial centers of weight-degree 2 under non-smooth perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the maximum number of limit cycles bifurcating from the period annulus of a family of cubic polynomial differential centers when it is perturbed inside the class of all cubic piecewise smooth polynomials. The family considered is the unique family of weight-homogeneous polynomial differential systems of weight-degree 2 with a center. When the switching line is $x=0$ or $y=0$, we obtain the sharp bounds of the number of limit cycles for the perturbed systems by using the first order averaging method. Our results indicate that non-smooth systems can have more limit cycles than smooth ones, and the switching lines play an important role in the dynamics of non-smooth systems.</description>

      <title>Compact Group Homeomorphisms Preserving The Haar Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the measure-preserving homeomorphisms on compact groups and proposes new methods for constructing measure-preserving homeomorphisms on direct products of compact groups and non-commutative compact groups.
  On the direct product of compact groups, we construct measure-preserving homeomorphisms using the method of integration. In particular, by applying this method to the \(n\)-dimensional torus \({\mathbb{T}}^{n}\), we can construct many new examples of measure-preserving homeomorphisms. We completely characterize the measure-preserving homeomorphisms on the two-dimensional torus where one coordinate is a translation depending on the other coordinate, and generalize this result to the \(n\)-dimensional torus.
  For non-commutative compact groups, we generalize the concept of the normalizer subgroup \(N\left( H\right)\) of the subgroup \(H\) to the normalizer subset \({E}_{K}( P)\) from the subset \(K\) to the subset \(P\) of the group of measure-preserving homeomorphisms. We prove that if \(\mu\) is the unique \(K\)-invariant measure, then the elements in \({E}_{K}\left( P\right)\) also preserve \(\mu\). In some non-commutative compact groups the normalizer subset \({E}_{G}\left( {\mathrm{{AF}}\left( G\right) }\right)\) can give non-affine homeomorphisms that preserve the Haar measure. Finally, we prove that when \(G\) is a finite cyclic group and a \(n\)-dimensional torus, then \(\mathrm{{AF}}\left( G\right)= N\left( G\right) = {E}_{G}\left( {\mathrm{{AF}}\left( G\right) }\right)\).</description>

      <title>Threshold-based impulsive biocontrol for coffee leaf rust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coffee leaf rust (CLR) severely affects coffee production worldwide, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. To reduce the cost of control, small-scale farmers often only apply control measures once a noticeable level of infection is reached. In this work, we develop mathematical models to better understand CLR dynamics and impulsive biocontrol with threshold-based interventions. We first use ordinary and impulsive differential equations to describe disease spread and the application of control measures once a certain infection level is detected. These models help determine when and how often interventions should occur. To capture the early stages of the disease and the chance that it might die out by itself, we then use a continuous-time Markov chain approach. This stochastic model allows us to estimate the probability that the pathogen fails to establish, thereby avoiding serious outbreaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01136v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the further development of the Lie bracket approximation approach for extremum seeking systems. Classical results in this area provide extremum seeking algorithms with exponential convergence rates for quadratic-like cost functions, and polynomial decay rates for cost functions of higher degrees. This paper proposes a novel control design approach that ensures the motion of the extremum seeking system along directions associated with higher-order Lie brackets, thereby ensuring exponential convergence for cost functions that are polynomial-like but with degree greater than two.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit for the Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in three dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^3}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-\frac{5}{12}+\sigma}$ where $\sigma&gt;0$ can be chosen arbitrarily small. This cut-off size is much smaller than the typical distance to the nearest neighbour. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the connections between independence, sequence entropy, and mean sensitivity for a measure preserving system under the action of a countable infinite discrete group. We establish that every sequence entropy tuple for an invariant measure is an IT tuple. Furthermore, if the acting group is amenable, we show that for an ergodic measure, the sequence entropy tuples, the mean sensitive tuples along some tempered F{\o}lner sequence, and the sensitive in the mean tuples along some tempered F{\o}lner sequence coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct continuous (and even invertible) linear operators acting on Banach (even Hilbert) spaces whose restrictions to their respective closed linear subspaces of chain recurrent vectors are not chain recurrent operators. This construction completely solves in the negative a problem posed by Nilson C. Bernardes Jr. and Alfred Peris on chain recurrence in Linear Dynamics. In particular: we show that the non-invertible case can be directly solved via relatively simple weighted backward shifts acting on certain unrooted directed trees; then we modify the non-invertible counterexample to address the invertible case, but falling outside the class of weighted shift operators; and we finally show that this behaviour cannot be achieved via classical (unilateral neither bilateral) weighted backward sifts (acting on $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ respectively) by noticing that a classical shift is a chain recurrent operator whenever it admits a non-zero chain recurrent vector.</description>

However, the black-box nature of these deep learning models presents significant challenges for carrying out simultaneous data assimilation (DA), which is a crucial technique for state estimation, model identification, and reconstructing missing data. Integrating ensemble-based DA methods with nonlinear deep learning models is computationally expensive and may suffer from large sampling errors. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning framework designed to simultaneously provide accurate forecasts and efficient DA. It is named Conditional Gaussian Koopman Network (CGKN), which transforms general nonlinear systems into nonlinear neural differential equations with conditional Gaussian structures. CGKN aims to retain essential nonlinear components while applying systematic and minimal simplifications to facilitate the development of analytic formulae for nonlinear DA. This allows for seamless integration of DA performance into the deep learning training process, eliminating the need for empirical tuning as required in ensemble methods. CGKN compensates for structural simplifications by lifting the dimension of the system, which is motivated by Koopman theory. Nevertheless, CGKN exploits special nonlinear dynamics within the lifted space. This enables the model to capture extreme events and strong non-Gaussian features in joint and marginal distributions with appropriate uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CGKN for both prediction and DA on three strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian turbulent systems: the projected stochastic Burgers-Sivashinsky equation, the Lorenz 96 system, and the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation. The results justify the robustness and computational efficiency of CGKN.</description>

      <title>Learning Koopman-based Stability Certificates for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02807</link>

Abstract: Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Substitution dynamical systems are loosely Kronecker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ be a primitive substitution on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n$ be the set of words of length $n$ determined by $\sigma$ (i.e., $w \in \mathcal{W}_n$ if $w$ is a subword of $\sigma^k(a)$ for some $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and $k \geq 1$). We show that the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ in the edit distance is $o(n)$. Thus, any two words in $\mathcal{W}_n$ have a common subsequence of length $n-o(n)$, which implies that the corresponding substitution dynamical system is loosely Kronecker (also known as zero-entropy loosely Bernoulli). The main challenge is handling the case where $\sigma$ is non-uniform. Finally, we show that for the Thue--Morse substitution, the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ is at least $\sqrt {n/6} - 1$.</description>

      <title>ResKoopNet: Learning Koopman Representations for Complex Dynamics with Spectral Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing long-term behaviors in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems remains challenging, with the Koopman operator framework providing a powerful global linearization approach, though existing methods for approximating its spectral components often suffer from theoretical limitations and reliance on predefined dictionaries. While Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) introduced the spectral residual to assess the accuracy of Koopman operator approximation, its only filters precomputed spectra, which prevents it from fully discovering the Koopman operator's complete spectral information (a limitation sometimes referred to as the 'spectral inclusion' problem). We introduce ResKoopNet (Residual-based Koopman-learning Network), a novel method that addresses this limitation by explicitly minimizing the spectral residual to compute Koopman eigenpairs, which can identify a more precise and complete spectrum of the Koopman operator. This approach provides theoretical guarantees while maintaining computational adaptability through a neural network implementation. Experiments on physical and biological systems demonstrate ResKoopNet's superior accuracy in spectral approximation compared to existing methods, particularly for systems with continuous spectra and high dimensional, which makes it as an effective tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of Powers of Two with All Even Digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding positive integers $n$ such that all the decimal digits of $2^n$ are even, i.e., belong to $\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$. Computational checks up to $n = 10^{13}$ reveal the known cases $n = 1, 2, 3, 6, 11$ and no additional instances. We present a self-contained argument, based on equidistribution and a shrinking targets approach, showing there are only finitely many positive integers $n$ for which $2^n$ has all even decimal digits.</description>
