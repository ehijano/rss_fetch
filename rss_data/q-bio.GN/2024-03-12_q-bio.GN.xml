      <title>Disentangling shared and private latent factors in multimodal Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for multimodal data permit the identification of latent factors that may be associated with important determinants of observed data heterogeneity. Common or shared factors could be important for explaining variation across modalities whereas other factors may be private and important only for the explanation of a single modality. Multimodal Variational Autoencoders, such as MVAE and MMVAE, are a natural choice for inferring those underlying latent factors and separating shared variation from private. In this work, we investigate their capability to reliably perform this disentanglement. In particular, we highlight a challenging problem setting where modality-specific variation dominates the shared signal. Taking a cross-modal prediction perspective, we demonstrate limitations of existing models, and propose a modification how to make them more robust to modality-specific variation. Our findings are supported by experiments on synthetic as well as various real-world multi-omics data sets.</description>

      <title>BEND: Benchmarking DNA Language Models on biologically meaningful tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features. BEND is available at https://github.com/frederikkemarin/BEND.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in the computational complexity of the shortest common superstring and genome assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome assembly, the process of reconstructing a long genetic sequence by aligning and merging short fragments, or reads, is known to be NP-hard, either as a version of the shortest common superstring problem or in a Hamiltonian-cycle formulation. That is, the computing time is believed to grow exponentially with the the problem size in the worst case. Despite this fact, high-throughput technologies and modern algorithms currently allow bioinformaticians to handle datasets of billions of reads. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we address this conundrum by demonstrating the existence of a phase transition in the computational complexity of the problem and showing that practical instances always fall in the 'easy' phase (solvable by polynomial-time algorithms). In addition, we propose a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method that outperforms common deterministic algorithms in the hard regime.</description>
