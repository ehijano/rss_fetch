      <title>Current Opinions on Memristor-Accelerated Machine Learning Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence has placed immense demands on computing hardware, but traditional silicon-based semiconductor technologies are approaching their physical and economic limit, prompting the exploration of novel computing paradigms. Memristor offers a promising solution, enabling in-memory analog computation and massive parallelism, which leads to low latency and power consumption. This manuscript reviews the current status of memristor-based machine learning accelerators, highlighting the milestones achieved in developing prototype chips, that not only accelerate neural networks inference but also tackle other machine learning tasks. More importantly, it discusses our opinion on current key challenges that remain in this field, such as device variation, the need for efficient peripheral circuitry, and systematic co-design and optimization. We also share our perspective on potential future directions, some of which address existing challenges while others explore untouched territories. By addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary efforts spanning device engineering, circuit design, and systems architecture, memristor-based accelerators could significantly advance the capabilities of AI hardware, particularly for edge applications where power efficiency is paramount.</description>

      <title>An Advanced Hybrid Quantum Tabu Search Approach to Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) is expected to solve incredibly difficult problems, including finding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. However, to date, QC alone is still far to demonstrate this capability except on small-sized problems. Hybrid approaches where QC and classical computing work together have shown the most potential for solving real-world scale problems. This work aims to show that we can enhance a classical optimization algorithm with QC so that it can overcome this limitation. We present a new hybrid quantum-classical tabu search (HQTS) algorithm to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Based on our prior work, HQTS leverages QC for routing within a classical tabu search framework. The quantum component formulates the traveling salesman problem (TSP) for each route as a QUBO, solved using D-Wave's Advantage system. Experiments investigate the impact of quantum routing frequency and starting solution methods. While different starting solution methods, including quantum-based and classical heuristics methods, it shows minimal overall impact. HQTS achieved optimal or near-optimal solutions for several CVRP problems, outperforming other hybrid CVRP algorithms and significantly reducing the optimality gap compared to preliminary research. The experimental results demonstrate that more frequent quantum routing improves solution quality and runtime. The findings highlight the potential of integrating QC within meta-heuristic frameworks for complex optimization in vehicle routing problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compilation for Shuttling Trapped-Ion Machines via the Position Graph Architectural Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growth of quantum platforms for gate-based quantum computation, compilation holds a crucial factor in deciding the success of the implementation. There has been rich research and development in compilation techniques for the superconducting-qubit regime. In contrast, the trapped-ion architectures, currently leading in robust quantum computations due to their reliable operations, do not have many competitive compilation strategies. This work presents a novel unifying abstraction, called the position graph, for different types of hardware architectures. Using this abstraction, we model trapped-ion Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures and enable high-quality, scalable superconducting compilation methods. In particular, we devise a scheduling algorithm called SHuttling-Aware PERmutative heuristic search algorithm (SHAPER) to tackle the complex constraints and dynamics of trapped-ion QCCD with the cooperation of state-of-the-art permutation-aware mapping. This approach generates native, executable circuits and ion instructions on the hardware that adheres to the physical constraints of shuttling-based quantum computers. Using the position graph abstraction, we evaluate our algorithm on theorized and actual architectures. Our algorithm can successfully compile programs for these architectures where other state-of-the-art algorithms fail. In the cases when other algorithms complete, our algorithm produces a schedule that is $14\%$ faster on average, up to $69\%$ in the best case.\\ {\bf Reproducibility:} source code and computational results are available at $[$will be added upon acceptance$]$</description>

      <title>TOFFE -- Temporally-binned Object Flow from Events for High-speed and Energy-Efficient Object Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection and tracking is an essential perception task for enabling fully autonomous navigation in robotic systems. Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</description>

      <title>QuSplit: Achieving Both High Fidelity and Throughput via Job Splitting on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we enter the quantum utility era, the computing paradigm shifts toward quantum-centric computing, where multiple quantum processors collaborate with classical computers, exemplified by platforms like IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket. In this paradigm, efficient resource management is crucial; however, unlike classical computing, quantum processors face significant challenges due to noise, which raises fidelity concerns in quantum applications. Compounding this issue, the noise characteristics across different quantum processors are inherently heterogeneous, making resource optimization even more complex. Existing resource management strategies primarily focus on mapping and scheduling jobs to these heterogeneous backends, which leads to some jobs suffering extremely low fidelity. Targeting quantum optimization jobs (e.g., VQC, VQE, QAOA) - one of the most promising quantum applications in the NISQ era, we hypothesize that running the later stages of a job on a high-fidelity quantum processor can significantly enhance overall fidelity. To validate this hypothesis, we use the VQE as a case study and propose a novel and efficient Genetic Algorithm-based scheduling framework with the consideration of job splitting. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high fidelity across all jobs and significantly improves system throughput. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm shows excellent scalability with respect to the number of quantum processors and the volume of jobs, making it a robust solution for emerging quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Indoor Channel Characterization with Extremely Large Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces at $300$ GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) is lately being considered as a boosting component for various indoor wireless applications, enabling wave propagation control and coverage extension. However, the incorporation of extremely large RISs, as recently being considered for ultra-high capacity industrial environments at subTHz frequencies, imposes certain challenges for indoor channel characterization. In particular, such RISs contribute additional multipath components and their large sizes with respect to the signal wavelength lead to near-field propagation. To this end, ray tracing approaches become quite cumbersome and need to be rerun for different RIS unit cell designs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the incorporation of RISs in indoor multipath environments towards their efficient channel characterization. An $100\times100$ RIS design with $2$-bit resolution unit cells realizing a fixed anomalous reflection at 300 GHz is presented, whose radar cross section patterns are obtained via full-wave simulations. It is showcased that the RIS behavior can be conveniently approximated by a three-ray model, which can be efficiently incorporated within available ray tracing tools, and that the far-field approximation is valid for even very small distances from the RIS.</description>

      <title>Chatbots im Schulunterricht: Wir testen das Fobizz-Tool zur automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06651v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.</description>
