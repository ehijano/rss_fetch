      <title>Simulation of charged particles in Earth's magnetosphere: an approach to the Van Allen belts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's magnetosphere, beyond protecting the ozone layer, is a natural phenomena which allows to study the interaction between charged particles from solar activity and electromagnetic fields. In this paper we studied trajectories of charged particles interacting with a constant dipole magnetic field as first approach of the Earth's magnetosphere using different initial conditions. As a result of this interaction there is a formation of well defined radiation regions by a confinement of charged particles around the lines of the magnetic field. These regions, called Van Allen radiation belts, are described by classical electrodynamics and appear naturally in the numerical modeling done in this work.</description>

      <title>Linear Theory of Visco-Resistive Tearing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a new linear theory of tearing instability is shown, where the modified LSC (Loureiro, Schekochihin, and Cowley) theory [36] developed from the original LSC theory [8] is extended from inviscid-resistive MHD to viscous-resistive MHD. In contrast to FKR [2] and original LSC theories, the upstream open boundary condition is implemented at a finite point $\xi_c$, which is an additional control parameter to determine the solutions. This paper firstly studies when the resistivity and viscosity are uniform in space. In addition, some variations in the nonuniformity are studied. It is shown that the non-uniformity can enhance the linear growth rate, rather than uniform case. Unexpectedly, this suggests that the forward cascade process of plasmoid instability (PI) does not stop, i.e., the finite differential MHD simulations fail. To stop the forward cascade, uniform viscosity is required not only in the inner region of the current sheet but also in the outer region. In the uniform case, the critical condition is predicted to be $2P_m/(S \xi_{c})=0.06$, beyond which the tearing instability, i.e., the forward cascade, stops. Here, $S$ is the Lundquist number, $P_m$ is the magnetic Prandtl number, and $\xi_{c}$ is the distance between the upstream open boundary and neutral sheet, where the current sheet thickness is fixed at $\xi_0=1.307$. According to the critical condition, the resistivity and viscosity employed in most MHD simulations of PI are too small to stop the forward cascade. This critical condition may be also applicable for the trigger problem of the current sheet destabilization in substorms and solar flares.</description>

      <title>Modelling ion acceleration and transport in corotating interaction regions: the mass-to-charge ratio dependence of the particle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of perpendicular diffusion in shaping energetic ion spectrum in corotating interaction regions (CIRs), focusing on its mass-to-charge ($A/Q$) dependence. We simulate a synthetic CIR using the EUropean Heliospheric FORcasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) and model the subsequent ion acceleration and transport by solving the focused transport equation incorporating both parallel and perpendicular diffusion. Our results reveal distinct differences in ion spectra between scenarios with and without perpendicular diffusion. In the absence of perpendicular diffusion, ion spectra near CIRs show a strong $(A/Q)^{\epsilon}$ dependence with $\epsilon$ depending on the turbulence spectral index, agreeing with theoretical predictions. In contrast, the incorporation of perpendicular diffusion, characterized by a weak $A/Q$ dependence, leading to similar spectra for different ion species. This qualitatively agrees with observations of energetic particles in CIRs.</description>

      <title>Solar Wind Driven from GONG Magnetograms in the Last Solar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous study, Huang et al. (2023) used the Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM), one of the widely used solar wind models in the community, driven by ADAPT-GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind in the last solar cycle and found that the optimal Poynting flux parameter can be estimated from either the open field area or the average unsigned radial component of the magnetic field in the open field regions. It was also found that the average energy deposition rate (Poynting flux) in the open field regions is approximately constant. In the current study, we expand the previous work by using GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind for the same Carrington rotations and determine if the results are similar to the ones obtained with ADAPT-GONG magnetograms. Our results indicate that similar correlations can be obtained from the GONG maps. Moreover, we report that ADAPT-GONG magnetograms can consistently provide better comparisons with 1 AU solar wind observations than GONG magnetograms, based on the best simulations selected by the minimum of the average curve distance for the solar wind speed and density.</description>
