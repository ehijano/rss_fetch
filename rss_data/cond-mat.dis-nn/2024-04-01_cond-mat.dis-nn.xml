      <title>High entropy metallic glasses, what does it mean?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed calorimetric measurements on 30 bulk metallic glasses differing with their mixing entropies DSmix. On this basis, the excess entropies DS and excess enthalpies DH of glasses with respect to their maternal crystalline states are calculated. It is found that the excess entropy DS on the average decreases with increasing mixing entropy DSmix. This means that so-called "high-entropymetallic glasses" (i.e. the glasses having high DSmix) actually constitute glasses with low excess entropy DS. We predict that such glasses should have reduced relaxation ability. We also found that the excess enthalpy DH of glass linearly increases with its excess entropy DS, in line with a general thermodynamic estimate.</description>

      <title>Simulating the dynamics of large many-body quantum systems with Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of powerful numerical techniques has drastically improved our understanding of quantum matter out of equilibrium. Inspired by recent progress in the area of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, this paper highlights hybrid Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques as an innovative approach to efficiently simulate certain aspects of many-body quantum dynamics on classical computers. To this end, we explore the nonequilibrium dynamics of two large subsystems, which interact sporadically in time, but otherwise evolve independently from each other. We consider subsystems with tunable disorder strength, relevant in the context of many-body localization, where one subsystem can act as a bath for the other. Importantly, studying the full interacting system, we observe that signatures of thermalization are enhanced compared to the reference case of having two independent subsystems. Notably, with the here proposed Schr\"odinger-Feynman method, we are able to simulate the pure-state survival probability in systems significantly larger than accessible by standard sparse-matrix techniques.</description>

      <title>Spin cones in random-field XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the arrangement of spins in the ground state of the XY model with quenched, random fields, on a fully connected graph. Two types of disordered fields are considered, namely randomly oriented magnetic fields, and randomly oriented crystal fields. Orientations are chosen from a uniformly isotropic distribution, but disorder fluctuations in each realization of a finite system lead to a breaking of rotational symmetry. The result is an interesting pattern of spin orientations, found by solving a system of coupled, nonlinear equations within perturbation theory and also by exact numerical continuation. All spins lie within a cone for small enough ratio of field to coupling strength, with an interesting distribution of spin orientations, with peaks at the cone edges. The orientation of the cone depends strongly on the realization of disorder, but the opening angle does not. In the case of random magnetic fields, the cone angle widens as the ratio increases till a critical value at which there is a first order phase transition and the cone disappears. With random crystal fields, there is no phase transition and the cone angle approaches $180^\circ$ for large values of the ratio. At finite low temperatures, Monte-Carlo simulations show that the formation of a cone and its subsequent alignment along the equilibrium direction occur on two different time scales.</description>

      <title>Training neural networks with structured noise improves classification and generalization</title>

Abstract: The beneficial role of noise-injection in learning is a consolidated concept in the field of artificial neural networks, suggesting that even biological systems might take advantage of similar mechanisms to optimize their performance. The training-with-noise algorithm proposed by Gardner and collaborators is an emblematic example of a noise-injection procedure in recurrent networks, which can be used to model biological neural systems. We show how adding structure to noisy training data can substantially improve the algorithm performance, allowing the network to approach perfect retrieval of the memories and wide basins of attraction, even in the scenario of maximal injected noise. We also prove that the so-called Hebbian Unlearning rule coincides with the training-with-noise algorithm when noise is maximal and data are stable fixed points of the network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hayden-Preskill Recovery in Hamiltonian Systems</title>

Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the unitary dynamics that quickly spreads and encodes localized quantum information over an entire many-body system and makes the information accessible from any small subsystem. While information scrambling is the key to understanding complex quantum many-body dynamics and is well-understood in random unitary models, it has been hardly explored in Hamiltonian systems. In this Letter, we investigate the information recovery in various time-independent Hamiltonian systems, including chaotic spin chains and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We show that information recovery is possible in certain, but not all, chaotic models, which highlights the difference between information recovery and quantum chaos based on the energy spectrum or the out-of-time-ordered correlators. We also show that information recovery probes transitions caused by the change of information-theoretic features of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Temporal relaxation of disordered many-body quantum systems under driving and dissipation</title>

Abstract: Strong disorder inhibits thermalization in isolated quantum systems and may lead to many-body localization (MBL). In realistic situations, however, the observation of MBL is hindered by residual couplings of the system to an environment, which acts as a bath and pushes the system to thermal equilibrium. This paper is concerned with the transient dynamics prior to thermalization and studies how the relaxation of a disordered system is altered under the influence of external driving and dissipation. We consider a scenario where a disordered quantum spin chain is placed into a strong magnetic field that polarizes the system. By suddenly removing the external field, a nonequilibrium situation is induced and the decay of magnetization probes the degree of localization. We show that by driving the system with light, one can distinguish between different dynamical regimes as the spins are more or less susceptible to the drive depending on the strength of the disorder. We provide evidence that some of these signatures remain observable at intermediate time scales even when the spin chain is subject to noise due to coupling to an environment. From a numerical point of view, we demonstrate that the open-system dynamics starting from a class of experimentally relevant mixed initial states can be efficiently simulated by combining dynamical quantum typicality with stochastic unraveling of Lindblad master equations.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of effective light transport properties in fully anisotropic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structurally anisotropic materials are ubiquitous in several application fields, yet their accurate optical characterization remains challenging due to the lack of general models linking their scattering coefficients to the macroscopic transport observables, and the need to combine multiple measurements to retrieve their direction-dependent values. Here, we present an improved method for the experimental determination of light transport tensor coefficients from the diffusive rates measured along all three directions, based on transient transmittance measurements and a generalized Monte Carlo model. We apply our method to the characterization of light transport properties in two common anisotropic materials - polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape and paper - highlighting the magnitude of systematic deviations that are typically incurred when neglecting anisotropy.</description>
