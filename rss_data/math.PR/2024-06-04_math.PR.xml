      <title>A quantitative dichotomy for Lyapunov exponents of non-dissipative SDEs with an application to electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a quantitative dichotomy for the top Lyapunov exponent of a class of non-dissipative SDEs on a compact manifold in the small noise limit. Specifically, we prove that in this class, either the Lyapunov exponent is zero for all noise strengths, or it is positive for all noise strengths and that the decay of the exponent in the small-noise limit cannot be faster than linear in the noise parameter. As an application, we study the top Lyapunov exponent for the motion of a charged particle in randomly-fluctuating magnetic fields, which also involves an interesting geometric control problem.</description>

      <title>Comparison theorems for mean-field BSDEs whose generators depend on the law of the solution $(Y,Z)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For general mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) it is well-known that we usually do not have the comparison theorem if the coefficients depend on the law of $Z$-component of the solution process $(Y, Z)$. A natural question is whether general mean-field BSDEs whose coefficients depend on the law of $Z$ have the comparison theorem for some cases. In this paper we establish the comparison theorems for one-dimensional mean-field BSDEs whose coefficients also depend on the joint law of the solution process $(Y,Z)$. With the help of Malliavin calculus and a BMO martingale argument, we obtain two comparison theorems for different cases and a strong comparison result. In particular, in this framework, we compare not only the first component $Y$ of the solution $(Y,Z)$ for such mean-field BSDEs, but also the second component $Z$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic approach to homogenization for a type of multivalued Dirichlet-Neumann problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is about homogenization for a type of multivalued Dirichlet-Neumann problems. First, we prove an average principle for general multivalued stochastic differential equations in the weak sense. Then for general forward-backward coupled multivalued stochastic systems, the other average principle is presented. Finally, we apply the result to a type of multivalued Dirichlet-Neumann problems and investigate its homogenization.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Functional It\^{o}'s Formula For L\'{e}vy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several versions of It\^{o}'s formula have been obtained in the setting of the functional stochastic calculus. In this regard, we present a local time-space version that works for arbitrary bounded and continuous functionals of L\'{e}vy processes and which does not depend on a functional's H\"{o}lder continuity.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the connectivity threshold and largest nearest-neighbour link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random uniform sample of $n$ points in a compact region $A$ of Euclidean $d$-space, $d \geq 2$, with a smooth or (when $d=2$) polygonal boundary. Fix $k \in {\bf N}$. Let $T_{n,k}$ be the threshold $r$ at which the geometric graph on these $n$ vertices with distance parameter $r$ becomes $k$-connected. We show that if $d=2$ then $n (\pi/|A|) T_{n,1}^2 - \log n$ is asymptotically standard Gumbel. For $(d,k) \neq (2,1)$, it is $n (\theta_d/|A|) T_{n,k}^d - (2-2/d) \log n - (4-2k-2/d) \log \log n$ that converges in distribution to a nondegenerate limit, where $\theta_d$ is the volume of the unit ball. The limit is Gumbel with scale parameter 2 except when $(d,k)=(2,2)$ where the limit is two component extreme value distributed. The different cases reflect the fact that boundary effects are more more important in some cases than others. We also give similar results for the largest $k$-nearest neighbour link $U_{n,k}$ in the sample, and show $T_{n,k}=U_{n,k}$ with high probability. We provide estimates on rates of convergence and give similar results for Poisson samples in $A$. Finally, we give similar results even for non-uniform samples, with a less explicit sequence of centring constants.</description>

      <title>Percolation games on rooted, edge-weighted random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a rooted Galton-Watson tree $T$, to each of whose edges we assign, independently, a weight that equals $+1$ with probability $p_{1}$, $0$ with probability $p_{0}$ and $-1$ with probability $p_{-1}=1-p_{1}-p_{0}$. We play a game on this rooted, edge-weighted Galton-Watson tree, involving two players and a token. The token is allowed to be moved from where it is currently located, say a vertex $u$ of $T$, to any child $v$ of $u$. The players begin with initial capitals that amount to $i$ and $j$ units respectively, and a player wins if either she is the first to amass a capital worth $\kappa$ units, where $\kappa$ is a pre-specified positive integer, or her opponent is the first to have her capital dwindle to $0$, or she is able to move the token to a leaf vertex, from where her opponent cannot move it any farther. This paper is concerned with studying the probabilities of the three possible outcomes (i.e. win for the first player, loss for the first player, and draw for both players) of this game, as well as finding conditions under which the expected duration of this game is finite. The theory we develop in this paper for the analysis of this game is further supported by observations obtained via computer simulations, and these observations provide a deeper insight into how the above-mentioned probabilities behave as the underlying parameters and / or offspring distributions are allowed to vary. We conclude the paper with a couple of conjectures, one of which suggests the occurrence of a phase transition phenomenon whereby the probability of draw in this game goes from being $0$ to being strictly positive as the parameter-pair $(p_{0},p_{1})$ is varied suitably while keeping the underlying offspring distribution of $T$ fixed.</description>

      <title>Kronecker-product random matrices and a matrix least squares problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue distribution and resolvent of a Kronecker-product random matrix model $A \otimes I_{n \times n}+I_{n \times n} \otimes B+\Theta \otimes \Xi \in \mathbb{C}^{n^2 \times n^2}$, where $A,B$ are independent Wigner matrices and $\Theta,\Xi$ are deterministic and diagonal. For fixed spectral arguments, we establish a quantitative approximation for the Stieltjes transform by that of an approximating free operator, and a diagonal deterministic equivalent approximation for the resolvent. We further obtain sharp estimates in operator norm for the $n \times n$ resolvent blocks, and show that off-diagonal resolvent entries fall on two differing scales of $n^{-1/2}$ and $n^{-1}$ depending on their locations in the Kronecker structure.
  Our study is motivated by consideration of a matrix-valued least-squares optimization problem $\min_{X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}} \frac{1}{2}\|XA+BX\|_F^2+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij} \xi_i\theta_j x_{ij}^2$ subject to a linear constraint. For random instances of this problem defined by Wigner inputs $A,B$, our analyses imply an asymptotic characterization of the minimizer $X$ and its associated minimum objective value as $n \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Intertwining and propagation of mixtures for generalized KMP models and harmonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic models of mass transport on discrete vertex set $V$. For these models, a one-parameter family of homogeneous product measures $\otimes_{i\in V} \nu_\theta$ is reversible. We prove that the set of mixtures of inhomogeneous product measures with equilibrium marginals, i.e., the set of measures of the form \[ \int\Big(\bigotimes_{i\in V} \nu_{\theta_i}\Big) \,\Xi(\prod_{i\in V}d\theta_i) \] is left invariant by the dynamics in the course of time, and the ``mixing measure'' $\Xi$ evolves according to a Markov process which we then call ``the hidden parameter model''. This generalizes results from [7] to a larger class of models and on more general graphs. The class of models includes discrete and continuous generalized KMP models, as well as discrete and continuous harmonic models. The results imply that in all these models, the non-equilibrium steady state of their reservoir driven version is a mixture of product measures where the mixing measure is in turn the stationary state of the corresponding ``hidden parameter model''. For the boundary-driven harmonic models on the chain $\{1,\ldots, N\}$ with nearest neighbor edges, we recover that the stationary measure of the hidden parameter model is the joint distribution of the ordered Dirichlet distribution (cf. [3]), with a purely probabilistic proof based on a spatial Markov property of the hidden parameter model.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the original version of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) presented in Ho, J., Jain, A., and Abbeel, P., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33 (2020), pp. 6840-6851. Our main theorem states that the sequence constructed by the original DDPM sampling algorithm weakly converges to a given data distribution as the number of time steps goes to infinity, under some asymptotic conditions on the parameters for the variance schedule, the $L^2$-based score estimation error, and the noise estimating function with respect to the number of time steps. In proving the theorem, we reveal that the sampling sequence can be seen as an exponential integrator type approximation of a reverse time stochastic differential equation (SDE). Moreover, we give a proper definition of the backward It\^o integral for general continuous processes and prove rigorously the reverse time representation of a given SDE with backward It\^o integral, without using the smoothness and uniqueness of the associated forward Kolmogorov equations.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic and Macroscopic Entropy Balance Equations in a Stochastic Dynamics and Its Deterministic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy, its production, and its change in a dynamical system can be understood from either a fully stochastic dynamic description or from a deterministic dynamics exhibiting chaotic behavior. By taking the former approach based on the general diffusion process with diffusion $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x)$ and drift $\bf b(\bf x)$, where $\alpha$ represents the ``size parameter'' of a system, we show that there are two distinctly different entropy balance equations. One reads ${\rm d} S^{(\alpha)}/{\rm d} t = e^{(\alpha)}_p + Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ for all $\alpha$. However, the leading $\alpha$-order, ``extensive'', terms of the entropy production rate $e^{(\alpha)}_p$ and heat exchange rate $Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ are exactly cancelled. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit of $\alpha\to\infty$, there is a second, local ${\rm d} S/{\rm d} t = \nabla\cdot{\bf b}({\bf x}(t))+\left({\bf D}:{\bf \Sigma}^{-1}\right)({\bf x}(t))$ on the order of $O(1)$, where $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x(t))$ represents the randomness generated in the dynamics usually represented by metric entropy, and $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf \Sigma}({\bf x}(t))$ is the covariance matrix of the local Gaussian description at ${\bf x}(t)$, which is a solution to the ordinary differential equation $\dot{\bf x}={\bf b}(\bf x)$ at time $t$. This latter equation is akin to the notions of volume-preserving conservative dynamics and entropy production in the deterministic dynamic approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics {\it \`{a} la} D. Ruelle. As a continuation of [17], mathematical details with sufficient care are given in four Appendices.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the continuous dependence on initial values and parameters of solutions as well as invariant measures for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions. In contrast to the classical SDEs, the solutions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs do not converge in probability although the initial values converge in probability, which is due to the mismatch of the distances between measures. Finally, we give some examples to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a specific type of SCM, called a Dynamic Structural Causal Model (DSCM), whose endogenous variables represent functions of time, which is possibly cyclic and allows for latent confounding. As a motivating use-case, we show that certain systems of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) can be appropriately represented with DSCMs. An immediate consequence of this construction is a graphical Markov property for systems of SDEs. We define a time-splitting operation, allowing us to analyse the concept of local independence (a notion of continuous-time Granger (non-)causality). We also define a subsampling operation, which returns a discrete-time DSCM, and which can be used for mathematical analysis of subsampled time-series. We give suggestions how DSCMs can be used for identification of the causal effect of time-dependent interventions, and how existing constraint-based causal discovery algorithms can be applied to time-series data.</description>

The aim of this paper is to study the probabilistic Lah numbers associated with Y and the probabilistic Lah-Bell polynomials associated with Y, as probabilistic versions of the Lah numbers and the Lah-Bell polynomials, respectively. We derive some properties, explicit expressions, recurrence relations and certain identities for those numbers and polynomials. In addition, we treat the special cases that Y is the Poisson random variable with parameter {\alpha} &gt; 0 and the Bernoulli random variable with probability of success p.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Vadim Kaimanovich presented a particular example of a measure on a product of two standard lamplighter groups such that the Poisson boundary of the induced random walk is non-trivial, but the boundary on the marginals is trivial. This was surprising since such behavior is not possible for measures of finite entropy. As we show in this paper, this secret-sharing phenomenon is possible precisely for pairs of amenable groups with non-trivial ICC-factors.</description>

      <title>Space-time deep neural network approximations for high-dimensional partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.02199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is one of the most challenging issues in applied mathematics to approximately solve high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) and most of the numerical approximation methods for PDEs in the scientific literature suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations employed in the corresponding approximation scheme to obtain an approximation precision $\varepsilon&gt;0$ grows exponentially in the PDE dimension and/or the reciprocal of $\varepsilon$. Recently, certain deep learning based approximation methods for PDEs have been proposed and various numerical simulations for such methods suggest that deep neural network (DNN) approximations might have the capacity to indeed overcome the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of real parameters used to describe the approximating DNNs grows at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$. There are now also a few rigorous results in the scientific literature which substantiate this conjecture by proving that DNNs overcome the curse of dimensionality in approximating solutions of PDEs. Each of these results establishes that DNNs overcome the curse of dimensionality in approximating suitable PDE solutions at a fixed time point $T&gt;0$ and on a compact cube $[a,b]^d$ in space but none of these results provides an answer to the question whether the entire PDE solution on $[0,T]\times [a,b]^d$ can be approximated by DNNs without the curse of dimensionality. It is precisely the subject of this article to overcome this issue. More specifically, the main result of this work in particular proves for every $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $ b\in (a,\infty)$ that solutions of certain Kolmogorov PDEs can be approximated by DNNs on the space-time region $[0,T]\times [a,b]^d$ without the curse of dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: We make a rigorous analysis of the existence and characterization of the free boundary related to the optimal stopping problem that maximizes the mean of an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck bridge. The result includes the Brownian bridge problem as a limit case. The methodology hereby presented relies on a time-space transformation that casts the original problem into a more tractable one with an infinite horizon and a Brownian motion underneath. We comment on two different numerical algorithms to compute the free-boundary equation and discuss illustrative cases that shed light on the boundary's shape. In particular, the free boundary generally does not share the monotonicity of the Brownian bridge case.</description>

      <title>A branching particle system as a model of semipushed fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of particles performing a one-dimensional dyadic branching Brownian motion with space-dependent branching rate, negative drift $-\mu$ and killed upon reaching $0$, starting with $N$ particles. More precisely, particles branch at rate $\rho/2$ in the interval $[0,1]$, for some $\rho&gt;1$, and at rate $1/2$ in $(1,+\infty)$. The drift $\mu(\rho)$ is chosen in such a way that, heuristically, the system is critical in some sense: the number of particles stays roughly constant before it eventually dies out. This particle system can be seen as an analytically tractable model for fluctuating fronts, describing the internal mechanisms driving the invasion of a habitat by a cooperating population. Recent studies from Birzu, Hallatschek and Korolev suggest the existence of three classes of fluctuating fronts: pulled, semipushed and pushed fronts. Here, we rigorously verify and make precise this classification and focus on the semipushed regime. More precisely, we prove the existence of two critical values $1&lt;\rho_1&lt;\rho_2$ such that for all $\rho\in(\rho_1,\rho_2)$, there exists $\alpha(\rho)\in(1,2)$ such that the rescaled number of particles in the system converges to an $\alpha$-stable continuous-state branching process on the time scale $N^{\alpha-1}$ as $N$ goes to infinity. This complements previous results from Berestycki, Berestycki and Schweinsberg for the case $\rho=1$.</description>

      <title>Gauge field marginal of an Abelian Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gauge field marginal of an Abelian Higgs model with Villain action defined on a 2D lattice in finite volume. Our first main result, which holds for gauge theories on arbitrary finite graphs and does not assume that the structure group is Abelian, is a loop expansion of the Radon--Nikodym derivative of the law of the gauge field marginal with respect to that of the pure gauge theory. This expansion is similar to the one of Seiler but holds in greater generality and uses a different graph theoretic approach. Furthermore, we show ultraviolet stability for the gauge field marginal of the model in a fixed gauge. More specifically, we show that moments of the H{\"o}lder--Besov-type norms introduced in arXiv:1808.09196 are bounded uniformly in the lattice spacing. This latter result relies on a quantitative diamagnetic inequality that in turn follows from the loop expansion and elementary properties of Gaussian random variables.</description>

Abstract: The log-Harnack inequality and Bismut formula are established for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with singularities in all (time, space, distribution) variables, where the drift satisfies a standard integrability condition in time-space, and may be discontinuous in the distance induced by any Dini function.
  The main results considerably improve the existing ones for the case where the drift is $L$-differentiable and Lipschitz continuous in distribution with respect to the quadratic Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stationary configurations of points in Euclidean space which are marked by positive random variables called scores. The scores are allowed to depend on the relative positions of other points and outside sources of randomness. Such models have been thoroughly studied in stochastic geometry, e.g. in the context of random tessellations or random geometric graphs.
  It turns out that in a neighbourhood of a point with an extreme score one can often rescale positions and scores of nearby points to obtain a limiting point process, which we call the tail configuration. Under some assumptions on dependence between scores, this local limit determines the global asymptotics for extreme scores within increasing windows in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The main result establishes the convergence of rescaled positions and clusters of high scores to a Poisson cluster process, quantifying the idea of the Poisson clumping heuristic by D. Aldous (in the point process setting).
  We apply our results to models based on (marked) Poisson processes where the scores depend on the distance to the $k$th nearest neighbor and where scores are allowed to propagate through a random network of points depending on their locations.</description>

Abstract: We study the barrier that gives the optimal time to exercise an American option written on a time-dependent Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, a diffusion often adopted by practitioners to model commodity prices and interest rates. By framing the optimal exercise of the American option as a problem of optimal stopping and relying on probabilistic arguments, we provide a non-linear Volterra-type integral equation characterizing the exercise boundary, develop a novel comparison argument to derive upper and lower bounds for such a boundary, and prove its Lipschitz continuity in any closed interval that excludes the expiration date and, thus, its differentiability almost everywhere. We implement a Picard iteration algorithm to solve the Volterra integral equation and show illustrative examples that shed light on the boundary's dependence on the process's drift and volatility.</description>

Abstract: We solve the non-discounted, finite-horizon optimal stopping problem of a Gauss-Markov bridge by using a time-space transformation approach. The associated optimal stopping boundary is proved to be Lipschitz continuous on any closed interval that excludes the horizon, and it is characterized by the unique solution of an integral equation. A Picard iteration algorithm is discussed and implemented to exemplify the numerical computation and geometry of the optimal stopping boundary for some illustrative cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the facilitated exclusion process, an interacting particle system on the integer line where particles hop to one of their left or right neighbouring site only when the other neighbouring site is occupied by a particle. A peculiarity of this system is that, starting from the step initial condition, the density profile develops a downward jump discontinuity around the position of the first particle, unlike other exclusion processes such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). In the weakly asymmetric regime, we show that the field of particle positions around the jump discontinuity converges to the solution of the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation (i.e. the exponential of a solution to the KPZ equation) on a half-line subject to Dirichlet boundary condition, with initial condition given by the derivative of a Dirac delta function. We prove this result by reformulating the problem in terms of ASEP on a half-line with a boundary reservoir, for which we extend known proofs of convergence to deal with Dirichlet boundary condition and the very singular type of initial condition that arises in our case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limit of the joint distribution of a multidimensional Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) process and its quadratic covariation process when the stable index tends to two. Under a proper scaling, the GTS processes converges to a Brownian motion that is a stable process with stable index two. We renormalize their quadratic covariation processes so that they have a nondegenerate limit distribution. We show that the limit is a stable process with stable index one and is independent of the limit Brownian motion of the GTS processes. In addition, we apply this convergence result to finance. By using the scaled GTS process defined above, we construct a pure jump asset price model approaching to the Black-Scholes model. To evaluate how $\alpha$-stable jumps affect the implied volatility, we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the at-the-money implied volatility skew when the model approaches to the Black-Scholes model.</description>

      <title>Coexistence, enhancements and short loops in random walk loop soups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general random walk loop soup which includes, or is related to, several models of interest, such as the Spin O(N) model, the double dimer model and the Bose gas. The analysis of this model is challenging because of the presence of spatial interactions between the loops. For this model it is known from Quitmann and Taggi (2022) that macroscopic loops occur in dimension three and higher when the inverse temperature is large enough. Our first result is that, on the $d$ dimensional lattice, the presence of repulsive interactions is responsible for a shift of the critical inverse temperature, which is strictly greater than $\frac{1}{2d}$, the critical value in the non interacting case. Our second result is that a positive density of microscopic loops exists for all values of the inverse temperature. This implies that, in the regime in which macroscopic loops are present, microscopic and macroscopic loops coexist. Moreover, we show that, even though the increase of the inverse temperature leads to an increase of the total loop length, the density of microscopic loops is uniformly bounded from above in the inverse temperature. Our last result is confined to the special case in which the random walk loop soup is the one associated to the Spin O(N) model with arbitrary integer values of $N \geq 2$ and states that, on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, the probability that two vertices are connected by a loop decays at least polynomially fast with their distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a transient spatially inhomogeneous random walk with asymptotically zero drifts on the lattice of the positive half line. We give criteria for the finiteness of the number of points having exactly the same local time and/or upcrossing time and weak cutpoints (a point $x$ is called a weak cutpoint if the walk never returns to $x-1$ after its first upcrossing from $x$ to $x+1$). In addition, for the walk with some special local drifts, we also give the order of the expected number of these points in $[1,n].$ Finally, we show that, when properly scaled, the number of these points in $[1,n]$ converges in distribution to a random variable with the standard exponential distribution. Our results answer three conjectures related to the local time, the upcrossing time, and the weak cutpoints proposed by E. Cs\'aki, A. F\"oldes, P. R\'ev\'esz [J. Theoret. Probab. 23 (2) (2010) 624-638].</description>

      <title>Zeros of random polynomials undergoing the heat flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the empirical distribution of the complex roots of high-degree random polynomials, when the polynomial undergoes the heat flow. In one prominent example of Weyl polynomials, the limiting zero distribution evolves from the circular law into the elliptic law until it collapses to the Wigner semicircle law, as was recently conjectured for characteristic polynomials of random matrices by Hall and Ho, 2022. Moreover, for a general family of random polynomials with independent coefficients and isotropic limiting distribution of zeros, we determine the zero distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials in terms of its logarithmic potential. Furthermore, we explicitly identify two critical time thresholds, at which singularities develop and at which the limiting distribution collapses to the semicircle law. We completely characterize the limiting root distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials before singularities develop as the push-forward of the initial distribution under a transport map. Finally, we discuss the results from the perspectives of partial differential equations (in particular Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Burgers' equation), optimal transport, and free probability. The theory is accompanied by explicit examples, simulations, and conjectures.</description>

Abstract: In the Kipnis Marchioro Presutti (KMP) model a positive energy $\zeta_i$ is associated with each vertex $i$ of a finite graph with a boundary. When a Poisson clock rings at an edge $ij$ with energies $\zeta_i,\zeta_j$, those values are substituted by $U(\zeta_i+\zeta_j)$ and $(1-U)(\zeta_i+\zeta_j)$, respectively, where $U$ is a uniform random variable in $(0,1)$. A value $T_j\ge 0$ is fixed at each boundary vertex $j$. The dynamics is defined in such way that the resulting Markov process $\zeta(t)$, satisfies that $\zeta_j(t)$ is exponential with mean $T_j$, for each boundary vertex $j$, for all $t$. We show that the invariant measure is the distribution of a vector $\zeta$ with coordinates $\zeta_i=T_i X_i$, where $X_i$ are iid exponential$(1)$ random variables, the law of $T$ is the invariant measure for an opinion random averaging/gossip model with the same boundary conditions of $\zeta$, and the vectors $X$ and $T$ are independent. The result confirms a conjecture based on the large deviations of the model. When the graph is one-dimensional, we bound the correlations of the invariant measure and perform the hydrostatic limit. We show that the empirical measure of a configuration chosen with the invariant measure converges to the linear interpolation of the boundary values.</description>

Abstract: Recognizing the regime of positive definiteness for a strictly logarithmic covariance kernel, we prove that the small deviations of a related Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) $M_\gamma$ are for each natural dimension $d$ always of lognormal type, i.e. the upper and lower limits as $t\to \infty$ of $$
  -\ln\Big(\mathbb{P}(M_\gamma(B(0,r))\le \delta \Big)/(\ln \delta)^2 $$
are finite and bounded away from zero. We then place the small deviations in the context of Laplace transforms of $M_\gamma$ and discuss the explicit bounds on the associated constants. We also provide some new representations of the Laplace transform of GMC related to a strictly logarithmic covariance kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the $[0,1]$-valued continuous random field solution $(u_t(x))_{t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb R}$ to the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation \[ \partial_t u_t = \frac{1}{2}\Delta u_t + b(u_t) + \sqrt{u_t(1-u_t)} \dot W, \] where $b(1)\leq 0\leq b(0)$ and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise. In this paper, we establish the weak existence and uniqueness of the above equation for a class of drifts $b(u)$ that may be irregular at the points where the noise coefficient is non-Lipschitz and degenerate, specifically at $u=0$ or $u=1$. This class of drifts includes non-Lipschitz drifts like $b(u) = u^q(1-u)$ for every $q\in (0,1)$, and some discontinuous drifts like $b(u) = \mathbf 1_{(0,1]}(u)-u$. This demonstrates a regularization effect of the multiplicative space-time white noise without the standard assumption that the noise coefficient is Lipschitz and non-degenerate.
  The method we apply is a further development of a moment duality technique that uses branching-coalescing Brownian motions as the dual particle system. To handle an irregular drift in the above equation, particles in the dual system are allowed to have a number of offspring with infinite expectation, and even an infinite number of offspring with positive probability. We show that, even though the branching mechanism with an infinite number of offspring causes explosions in finite time, immediately after each explosion, the total population comes down from infinity due to the coalescing mechanism. Our results on this dual particle system are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite horizon optimal stopping problem for a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. The objective is to design stopping rules that attempt to select the random variable with the highest value in the sequence. The performance of any stopping rule may be benchmarked relative to the selection of a ``prophet" that has perfect foreknowledge of the largest value. Such comparisons are typically stated in the form of "prophet inequalities." In this paper we characterize sharp prophet inequalities for single threshold stopping rules as solutions to infinite two person zero sum games on the unit square with special payoff kernels. The proposed game theoretic characterization allows one to derive sharp non-asymptotic prophet inequalities for different classes of distributions. This, in turn, gives rise to a simple and computationally tractable algorithmic paradigm for deriving optimal single threshold stopping rules.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Convergence of the Continuous-Time JSQ System with General Distributions in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) system with general interarrival and service distributions. Under a much weaker assumption than the one in the literature, we prove that each station's scaled steady-state queue length weakly converges to an identical exponential random variable in heavy traffic. Specifically, we establish our results by only assuming $2+\delta_0$ moment on the arrival and service distributions for some $\delta_0&gt;0$. Our proof exploits the Palm version of the basic adjoint relationship (BAR) approach as a key technique.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetric schemes for stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift: an unadjusted Barker algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new simple and explicit numerical scheme for time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations. The scheme is based on sampling increments at each time step from a skew-symmetric probability distribution, with the level of skewness determined by the drift and volatility of the underlying process. We show that as the step-size decreases the scheme converges weakly to the diffusion of interest. We then consider the problem of simulating from the limiting distribution of an ergodic diffusion process using the numerical scheme with a fixed step-size. We establish conditions under which the numerical scheme converges to equilibrium at a geometric rate, and quantify the bias between the equilibrium distributions of the scheme and of the true diffusion process. Notably, our results do not require a global Lipschitz assumption on the drift, in contrast to those required for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for long-time simulation at fixed step-sizes. Our weak convergence result relies on an extension of the theory of Milstein \&amp; Tretyakov to stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift, which could also be of independent interest. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Cumulants: Multiplicative Convolutions, Genus Expansion and Infinitesimal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two polynomials $p(x), q(x)$ of degree $d$, we give a combinatorial formula for the finite free cumulants of $p(x)\boxtimes_d q(x)$. We show that this formula admits a topological expansion in terms of non-crossing multi-annular permutations on surfaces of different genera.
  This topological expansion, on the one hand, deepens the connection between the theories of finite free probability and free probability, and in particular proves that $\boxtimes_d$ converges to $\boxtimes$ as $d$ goes to infinity. On the other hand, borrowing tools from the theory of second order freeness, we use our expansion to study the infinitesimal distribution of certain families of polynomials which include Hermite and Laguerre, and draw some connections with the theory of infinitesimal distributions for real random matrices.
  Finally, building off our results we give a new short and conceptual proof of a recent result [Steinerberger (2020), Hoskins and Kabluchko (2020)] that connects root distributions of polynomial derivatives with free fractional convolution powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article discusses random hypergraphs with varying hyperedge sizes, admitting large hyperedges with size tending to infinity, and heavy-tailed limiting hyperedge size distributions. The main result describes a threshold for the random hypergraph to be connected with high probability, and shows that the average hyperedge size suffices to characterise connectivity under mild regularity assumptions. Especially, the connectivity threshold is in most cases insensitive to the shape and higher moments of the hyperedge size distribution. Similar results are also provided for related random intersection graph models.</description>

      <title>Kernel Stein Discrepancy on Lie Groups: Theory and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributional approximation is a fundamental problem in machine learning with numerous applications across all fields of science and engineering and beyond. The key challenge in most approximation methods is the need to tackle the intractable normalization constant pertaining to the parametrized distributions used to model the data. In this paper, we present a novel Stein operator on Lie groups leading to a kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) which is a normalization-free loss function. We present several theoretical results characterizing the properties of this new KSD on Lie groups and its minimizers namely, the minimum KSD estimator (MKSDE). Proof of several properties of MKSDE are presented, including strong consistency, CLT and a closed form of the MKSDE for the von Mises-Fisher distribution on SO(N). Finally, we present experimental evidence depicting advantages of minimizing KSD over maximum likelihood estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a faster direct sampling algorithm for random equilateral closed polygons in three-dimensional space. This method improves on the moment polytope sampling algorithm of Cantarella, Duplantier, Shonkwiler, and Uehara (2016) and has (expected) time per sample quadratic in the number of edges in the polygon. We use our new sampling method and a new code for computing invariants based on the Alexander polynomial to investigate the probability of finding unknots among equilateral closed polygons.</description>

Abstract: This study demonstrates that the boundedness of the \( H^\infty \)-calculus for the negative discrete Laplace operator is independent of the spatial mesh size. Using this result, we deduce the discrete stochastic maximal \( L^p \)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, we derive (nearly) sharp error estimates for the semidiscretization under the general spatial \( L^q \)-norms.</description>

      <title>On anomalous diffusion in the Kraichnan model and correlated-in-time variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a concise PDE-based proof of anomalous diffusion in the Kraichan model -- a stochastic, white-in-time model of passive scalar turbulence. That is, we show an exponential rate of $L^2$ decay in expectation of a passive scalar advected by a certain white-in-time, correlated-in-space, divergence-free Gaussian field, uniform in the initial data and the diffusivity of the passive scalar. Additionally, we provide examples of correlated-in-time versions of the Kraichnan model which fail to exhibit anomalous diffusion despite their (formal) white-in-time limits exhibiting anomalous diffusion. As part of this analysis, we prove that anomalous diffusion of a scalar advected by some flow implies non-uniqueness of the ODE trajectories of that flow.</description>

      <title>An algebraic geometry of paths via the iterated-integrals signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to previous approaches bringing together algebraic geometry and signatures of paths, we introduce a Zariski topology on the space of paths itself, and study path varieties consisting of all paths whose iterated-integrals signature satisfies certain polynomial equations. Particular emphasis lies on the role of the non-associative halfshuffle, which makes it possible to describe varieties of paths that satisfy certain relations all along their trajectory. Specifically, we may understand the set of paths on a given classical algebraic variety in $\mathbb{R}^d$ starting from a fixed point as a path variety, e.g. paths on a sphere. While the characteristic geometric property of halfshuffle varieties is that they are stable under stopping paths at an earlier time, we furthermore study varieties which are stable under the natural (semi)group operation of concantenation of paths. We point out how the notion of dimension for path varieties crucially depends on the fact that they may be reducible into countably infinitely many subvarieties. Finally, we see that studying halfshuffle varieties naturally leads to a generalization of classical algebraic curves, surfaces and affine varieties in finite dimensional space. These generalized algebraic sets, an example being the graph of the exponential function, are now described through iterated-integral equations.

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give a broad overview of the intersection of partial differential equations (PDEs) and graph-based semi-supervised learning. The overview is focused on a large body of recent work on PDE continuum limits of graph-based learning, which have been used to prove well-posedness of semi-supervised learning algorithms in the large data limit. We highlight some interesting research directions revolving around consistency of graph-based semi-supervised learning, and present some new results on the consistency of $p$-Laplacian semi-supervised learning using the stochastic tug-of-war game interpretation of the $p$-Laplacian. We also present the results of some numerical experiments that illustrate our results and suggest directions for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks, a novel family of architectures that integrates partial stochasticity into the framework of infinitely deep neural networks. Our new class of architectures is designed to improve the computational efficiency of existing architectures at training and inference time. To do this, we leverage the advantages of partial stochasticity in the infinite-depth limit which include the benefits of full stochasticity e.g. robustness, uncertainty quantification, and memory efficiency, whilst improving their limitations around computational complexity. We present a variety of architectural configurations, offering flexibility in network design including different methods for weight partition. We also provide mathematical guarantees on the expressivity of our models by establishing that our network family qualifies as Universal Conditional Distribution Approximators. Lastly, empirical evaluations across multiple tasks show that our proposed architectures achieve better downstream task performance and uncertainty quantification than their counterparts while being significantly more efficient.

      <title>How Flawed Is ECE? An Analysis via Logit Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Informally, a model is calibrated if its predictions are correct with a probability that matches the confidence of the prediction. By far the most common method in the literature for measuring calibration is the expected calibration error (ECE). Recent work, however, has pointed out drawbacks of ECE, such as the fact that it is discontinuous in the space of predictors. In this work, we ask: how fundamental are these issues, and what are their impacts on existing results? Towards this end, we completely characterize the discontinuities of ECE with respect to general probability measures on Polish spaces. We then use the nature of these discontinuities to motivate a novel continuous, easily estimated miscalibration metric, which we term Logit-Smoothed ECE (LS-ECE). By comparing the ECE and LS-ECE of pre-trained image classification models, we show in initial experiments that binned ECE closely tracks LS-ECE, indicating that the theoretical pathologies of ECE may be avoidable in practice.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Given a continuous plurisubharmonic function $u$ on $\Omega$, we construct a sequence of Gaussian analytic functions $f_n$ on $\Omega$ associated with $u$ such that $\frac{1}{n}\log|f_n|$ converges to $u$ in $L^1_{loc}(\Omega)$ almost surely, as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Gaussian analytic function $f_n$ is constructed by its covariance, or equivalently by its reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is given by weighed Bergman space with weight $e^{-2nu}$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We show the normalized zeros of $f_n$ converge to $dd^c u$ in the sense of currents.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Randomness, Effective Disintegrations, and Rates of Convergence to the Truth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: L\'evy's Upward Theorem says that the conditional expectation of an integrable random variable converges with probability one to its true value with increasing information. In this paper, we use methods from effective probability theory to characterise the probability one set along which convergence to the truth occurs, and the rate at which the convergence occurs. We work within the setting of computable probability measures defined on computable Polish spaces and introduce a new general theory of effective disintegrations. We use this machinery to prove our main results, which (1) identify the points along which certain classes of effective random variables converge to the truth in terms of certain classes of algorithmically random points, and which further (2) identify when computable rates of convergence exist. Our convergence results significantly generalize earlier results within a unifying novel abstract framework, and there are no precursors of our results on computable rates of convergence. Finally, we make a case for the importance of our work for the foundations of Bayesian probability theory.</description>

      <title>Existence of Optimal Stationary Singular Controls and Mean Field Game Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the stationary relaxed singular control problem within a multi-dimensional framework for a single agent, as well as its Mean Field Game (MFG) equivalent. We demonstrate that optimal relaxed controls exist for both maximization and minimization cases. These relaxed controls are defined by random measures across the state and control spaces, with the state process described as a solution to the associated martingale problem. By leveraging findings from [Kurtz-Stockbridge 2001], we establish the equivalence between the martingale problem and the stationary forward equation. This allows us to reformulate the relaxed control problem into a linear programming problem within the measure space. We prove the sequential compactness of these measures, thereby confirming the feasibility of achieving an optimal solution. Subsequently, our focus shifts to Mean Field Games. Drawing on insights from the single-agent problem and employing Kakutani--Glicksberg--Fan fixed point theorem, we derive the existence of a mean field game equilibria.</description>
