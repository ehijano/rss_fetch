      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Feedback: Insights from Intelligent Tutoring Systems and the Learning Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) focuses on the intersection of technology, education, and psychology, placing a strong emphasis on supporting learners' needs with compassion and understanding. The growing prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of scalable solutions within educational settings, including generating different types of feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, the approach to utilizing these models often involves directly formulating prompts to solicit specific information, lacking a solid theoretical foundation for prompt construction and empirical assessments of their impact on learning. This work advocates careful and caring AIED research by going through previous research on feedback generation in ITS, with emphasis on the theoretical frameworks they utilized and the efficacy of the corresponding design in empirical evaluations, and then suggesting opportunities to apply these evidence-based principles to the design, experiment, and evaluation phases of LLM-based feedback generation. The main contributions of this paper include: an avocation of applying more cautious, theoretically grounded methods in feedback generation in the era of generative AI; and practical suggestions on theory and evidence-based feedback design for LLM-powered ITS.</description>

      <title>AffirmativeAI: Towards LGBTQ+ Friendly Audit Frameworks for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LGBTQ+ community face disproportionate mental health challenges, including higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Research has shown that LGBTQ+ people have been using large language model-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, for their mental health needs. Despite the potential for immediate support and anonymity these chatbots offer, concerns regarding their capacity to provide empathetic, accurate, and affirming responses remain. In response to these challenges, we propose a framework for evaluating the affirmativeness of LLMs based on principles of affirmative therapy, emphasizing the need for attitudes, knowledge, and actions that support and validate LGBTQ+ experiences. We propose a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, hoping to establish benchmarks for "Affirmative AI," ensuring that LLM-based chatbots can provide safe, supportive, and effective mental health support to LGBTQ+ individuals. We benchmark LLM affirmativeness not as a mental health solution for LGBTQ+ individuals or to claim it resolves their mental health issues, as we highlight the need to consider complex discrimination in the LGBTQ+ community when designing technological aids. Our goal is to evaluate LLMs for LGBTQ+ mental health support since many in the community already use them, aiming to identify potential harms of using general-purpose LLMs in this context.</description>

      <title>Corporate Communication Companion (CCC): An LLM-empowered Writing Assistant for Workplace Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Workplace social media platforms enable employees to cultivate their professional image and connect with colleagues in a semi-formal environment. While semi-formal corporate communication poses a unique set of challenges, large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in helping users draft and edit their social media posts. However, LLMs may fail to capture individualized tones and voices in such workplace use cases, as they often generate text using a "one-size-fits-all" approach that can be perceived as generic and bland. In this paper, we present Corporate Communication Companion (CCC), an LLM-empowered interactive system that helps people compose customized and individualized workplace social media posts. Using need-finding interviews to motivate our system design, CCC decomposes the writing process into two core functions, outline and edit: First, it suggests post outlines based on users' job status and previous posts, and next provides edits with attributions that users can contextually customize. We conducted a within-subjects user study asking participants both to write posts and evaluate posts written by others. The results show that CCC enhances users' writing experience, and audience members rate CCC-enhanced posts as higher quality than posts written using a non-customized writing assistant. We conclude by discussing the implications of LLM-empowered corporate communication.</description>

      <title>Responding to Generative AI Technologies with Research-through-Design: The Ryelands AI Lab as an Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI technologies demand new practical and critical competencies, which call on design to respond to and foster these. We present an exploratory study guided by Research-through-Design, in which we partnered with a primary school to develop a constructionist curriculum centered on students interacting with a generative AI technology. We provide a detailed account of the design of and outputs from the curriculum and learning materials, finding centrally that the reflexive and prolonged `hands-on' approach led to a co-development of students' practical and critical competencies. From the study, we contribute guidance for designing constructionist approaches to generative AI technology education; further arguing to do so with `critical responsivity.' We then discuss how HCI researchers may leverage constructionist strategies in designing interactions with generative AI technologies; and suggest that Research-through-Design can play an important role as a `rapid response methodology' capable of reacting to fast-evolving, disruptive technologies such as generative AI.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Perceived Tone, Age, and Gender on Voice Assistant Persuasiveness in the Context of Product Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice Assistants (VAs) can assist users in various everyday tasks, but many users are reluctant to rely on VAs for intricate tasks like online shopping. This study aims to examine whether the vocal characteristics of VAs can serve as an effective tool to persuade users and increase user engagement with VAs in online shopping. Prior studies have demonstrated that the perceived tone, age, and gender of a voice influence the perceived persuasiveness of the speaker in interpersonal interactions. Furthermore, persuasion in product communication has been shown to affect purchase decisions in online shopping. We investigate whether variations in a VA voice's perceived tone, age, and gender characteristics can persuade users, and ultimately affect their purchase decisions. Our experimental study showed that participants were more persuaded to make purchase decisions by VA voices having positive or neutral tones as well as middle-aged male or younger female voices. Our results suggest that VA designers should offer users the ability to easily customize VA voices with a range of tones, ages, and genders. This customization can enhance user comfort and enjoyment, potentially leading to higher engagement with VAs. Additionally, we discuss the boundaries of ethical persuasion, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding users' interests against unwarranted manipulation.</description>

      <title>Practice-informed Patterns for Organising Large Groups in Distributed Mixed Reality Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborating across dissimilar, distributed spaces presents numerous challenges for computer-aided spatial communication. Mixed reality (MR) can blend selected surfaces, allowing collaborators to work in blended f-formations (facing formations), even when their workstations are physically misaligned. Since collaboration often involves more than just participant pairs, this research examines how we might scale MR experiences for large-group collaboration. To do so, this study recruited collaboration designers (CDs) to evaluate and reimagine MR for large-scale collaboration. These CDs were engaged in a four-part user study that involved a technology probe, a semi-structured interview, a speculative low-fidelity prototyping activity and a validation session. The outcomes of this paper contribute (1) a set of collaboration design principles to inspire future computer-supported collaborative work, (2) eight collaboration patterns for blended f-formations and collaboration at scale and (3) theoretical implications for f-formations and space-place relationships. As a result, this work creates a blueprint for scaling collaboration across distributed spaces.</description>

      <title>Impact of Tone-Aware Explanations in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommender systems, the presentation of explanations plays a crucial role in supporting users' decision-making processes. Although numerous existing studies have focused on the effects (transparency or persuasiveness) of explanation content, explanation expression is largely overlooked. Tone, such as formal and humorous, is directly linked to expressiveness and is an important element in human communication. However, studies on the impact of tone on explanations within the context of recommender systems are insufficient. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of explanation tones through an online user study from three aspects: perceived effects, domain differences, and user attributes. We create a dataset using a large language model to generate fictional items and explanations with various tones in the domain of movies, hotels, and home products. Collected data analysis reveals different perceived effects of tones depending on the domains. Moreover, user attributes such as age and personality traits are found to influence the impact of tone. This research underscores the critical role of tones in explanations within recommender systems, suggesting that attention to tone can enhance user experience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This position paper explores the benefits, drawbacks, and ethical considerations of incorporating synthetic personae in HCI research, particularly focusing on the customization challenges beyond the limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). These perspectives are derived from the initial results of a sub-study employing vignettes to showcase the existence of bias within black-box LLMs and explore methods for manipulating them. The study aims to establish a foundation for understanding the challenges associated with these models, emphasizing the necessity of thorough testing before utilizing them to create synthetic personae for HCI research.</description>

      <title>The Potential and Implications of Generative AI on HCI Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) is impacting teaching and learning directly or indirectly across a range of subjects and disciplines. As educators, we need to understand the potential and limitations of AI in HCI education and ensure our graduating HCI students are aware of the potential and limitations of AI in HCI. In this paper, we report on the main pedagogical insights gained from the inclusion of generative AI into a 10 week undergraduate module. We designed the module to encourage student experimentation with GAI models as part of the design brief requirement and planned practical sessions and discussions. Our insights are based on replies to a survey sent out to the students after completing the module. Our key findings, for HCI educators, report on the use of AI as a persona for developing project ideas and creating resources for design, and AI as a mirror for reflecting students' understanding of key concepts and ideas and highlighting knowledge gaps. We also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and the need to assess students' literacies and assumptions of GAIs as pedagogical tools. Finally, we put forward the case for educators to take the opportunities GAI presents as an educational tool and be experimental, creative, and courageous in their practice. We end with a discussion of our findings in relation to the TPACK framework in HCI.</description>

      <title>"Community Guidelines Make this the Best Party on the Internet": An In-Depth Study of Online Platforms' Content Moderation Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moderating user-generated content on online platforms is crucial for balancing user safety and freedom of speech. Particularly in the United States, platforms are not subject to legal constraints prescribing permissible content. Each platform has thus developed bespoke content moderation policies, but there is little work towards a comparative understanding of these policies across platforms and topics. This paper presents the first systematic study of these policies from the 43 largest online platforms hosting user-generated content, focusing on policies around copyright infringement, harmful speech, and misleading content. We build a custom web-scraper to obtain policy text and develop a unified annotation scheme to analyze the text for the presence of critical components. We find significant structural and compositional variation in policies across topics and platforms, with some variation attributable to disparate legal groundings. We lay the groundwork for future studies of ever-evolving content moderation policies and their impact on users.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Anchoring Bias: The Potential of AI and XAI-based Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information systems (IS) are frequently designed to leverage the negative effect of anchoring bias to influence individuals' decision-making (e.g., by manipulating purchase decisions). Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the explanations of its decisions through explainable AI (XAI) have opened new opportunities for mitigating biased decisions. So far, the potential of these technological advances to overcome anchoring bias remains widely unclear. To this end, we conducted two online experiments with a total of N=390 participants in the context of purchase decisions to examine the impact of AI and XAI-based decision support on anchoring bias. Our results show that AI alone and its combination with XAI help to mitigate the negative effect of anchoring bias. Ultimately, our findings have implications for the design of AI and XAI-based decision support and IS to overcome cognitive biases.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Imperfect XAI on Human-AI Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainability techniques are rapidly being developed to improve human-AI decision-making across various cooperative work settings. Consequently, previous research has evaluated how decision-makers collaborate with imperfect AI by investigating appropriate reliance and task performance with the aim of designing more human-centered computer-supported collaborative tools. Several human-centered explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed in hopes of improving decision-makers' collaboration with AI; however, these techniques are grounded in findings from previous studies that primarily focus on the impact of incorrect AI advice. Few studies acknowledge the possibility of the explanations being incorrect even if the AI advice is correct. Thus, it is crucial to understand how imperfect XAI affects human-AI decision-making. In this work, we contribute a robust, mixed-methods user study with 136 participants to evaluate how incorrect explanations influence humans' decision-making behavior in a bird species identification task, taking into account their level of expertise and an explanation's level of assertiveness. Our findings reveal the influence of imperfect XAI and humans' level of expertise on their reliance on AI and human-AI team performance. We also discuss how explanations can deceive decision-makers during human-AI collaboration. Hence, we shed light on the impacts of imperfect XAI in the field of computer-supported cooperative work and provide guidelines for designers of human-AI collaboration systems.</description>

      <title>SpatialVisVR: An Immersive, Multiplexed Medical Image Viewer With Contextual Similar-Patient Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contemporary pathology, multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) present both significant opportunities and challenges. These methodologies shed light on intricate tumor microenvironment interactions, emphasizing the need for intuitive visualization tools to analyze vast biological datasets effectively. As electronic health records (EHR) proliferate and physicians face increasing information overload, the integration of advanced technologies becomes imperative. SpatialVisVR emerges as a versatile VR platform tailored for comparing medical images, with adaptability for data privacy on embedded hardware. Clinicians can capture pathology slides in real-time via mobile devices, leveraging SpatialVisVR's deep learning algorithm to match and display similar mIF images. This interface supports the manipulation of up to 100 multiplexed protein channels, thereby assisting in immuno-oncology decision-making. Ultimately, SpatialVisVR aims to streamline diagnostic processes, advocating for a comprehensive and efficient approach to immuno-oncology research and treatment.</description>

Abstract: Since the advent of personal computing devices, intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) have been one of the key technologies that researchers and engineers have focused on, aiming to help users efficiently obtain information and execute tasks, and provide users with more intelligent, convenient, and rich interaction experiences. With the development of smartphones and IoT, computing and sensing devices have become ubiquitous, greatly expanding the boundaries of IPAs. However, due to the lack of capabilities such as user intent understanding, task planning, tool using, and personal data management etc., existing IPAs still have limited practicality and scalability. Recently, the emergence of foundation models, represented by large language models (LLMs), brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. With the powerful semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLM can enable intelligent agents to solve complex problems autonomously. In this paper, we focus on Personal LLM Agents, which are LLM-based agents that are deeply integrated with personal data and personal devices and used for personal assistance. We envision that Personal LLM Agents will become a major software paradigm for end-users in the upcoming era. To realize this vision, we take the first step to discuss several important questions about Personal LLM Agents, including their architecture, capability, efficiency and security. We start by summarizing the key components and design choices in the architecture of Personal LLM Agents, followed by an in-depth analysis of the opinions collected from domain experts. Next, we discuss several key challenges to achieve intelligent, efficient and secure Personal LLM Agents, followed by a comprehensive survey of representative solutions to address these challenges.</description>

      <title>ActSonic: Recognizing Everyday Activities from Inaudible Acoustic Waves Around the Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ActSonic, an intelligent, low-power active acoustic sensing system integrated into eyeglasses that can recognize 27 different everyday activities (e.g., eating, drinking, toothbrushing) from inaudible acoustic waves around the body with a time resolution of one second. It only needs a pair of miniature speakers and microphones mounted on each hinge of eyeglasses to emit ultrasonic waves to create an acoustic aura around the body. Based on the position and motion of various body parts, the acoustic signals are reflected with unique patterns captured by the microphone and analyzed by a customized self-supervised deep learning framework to infer the performed activities. ActSonic was deployed in a user study with 19 participants across 19 households to evaluate its efficacy. Without requiring any training data from a new user (leave-one-participant-out evaluation), ActSonic was able to detect 27 activities, achieving an average F1-score of 86.6% in fully unconstrained scenarios and 93.4% in prompted settings at participants' homes.</description>

      <title>A Reliable Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Anomaly Detection in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performed models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights to detect such issues by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation with two time series datasets and user studies demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD in fostering a deeper human understanding, immediate corrective actions, and the reliability enhancement of models.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Disparities in Web Task Handling Between Human and Web Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04497</link>

Abstract: With the advancement of Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVMs), agents have shown significant capabilities in various tasks, such as data analysis, gaming, or code generation. Recently, there has been a surge in research on web agents, capable of performing tasks within the web environment. However, the web poses unforeseeable scenarios, challenging the generalizability of these agents. This study investigates the disparities between human and web agents' performance in web tasks (e.g., information search) by concentrating on planning, action, and reflection aspects during task execution. We conducted a web task study with a think-aloud protocol, revealing distinct cognitive actions and operations on websites employed by humans. Comparative examination of existing agent structures and human behavior with thought processes highlighted differences in knowledge updating and ambiguity handling when performing the task. Humans demonstrated a propensity for exploring and modifying plans based on additional information and investigating reasons for failure. These findings offer insights into designing planning, reflection, and information discovery modules for web agents and designing the capturing method for implicit human knowledge in a web task.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Method for Sequential Recommendation based on Multi-Intention Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation is one of the important branches of recommender system, aiming to achieve personalized recommended items for the future through the analysis and prediction of users' ordered historical interactive behaviors. However, along with the growth of the user volume and the increasingly rich behavioral information, how to understand and disentangle the user's interactive multi-intention effectively also poses challenges to behavior prediction and sequential recommendation. In light of these challenges, we propose a Contrastive Learning sequential recommendation method based on Multi-Intention Disentanglement (MIDCL). In our work, intentions are recognized as dynamic and diverse, and user behaviors are often driven by current multi-intentions, which means that the model needs to not only mine the most relevant implicit intention for each user, but also impair the influence from irrelevant intentions. Therefore, we choose Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to realize the disentanglement of users' multi-intentions. We propose two types of contrastive learning paradigms for finding the most relevant user's interactive intention, and maximizing the mutual information of positive sample pairs, respectively. Experimental results show that MIDCL not only has significant superiority over most existing baseline methods, but also brings a more interpretable case to the research about intention-based prediction and recommendation.</description>
